When going to this link, if the provided email already has a Zapier account, the user will be asked to log in.
If the email does not have a Zapier account, the user will be asked to create an account with the provided email and name.

Upon creating an account or logging in, the user will be taken to

The user will get a Zapier account, be brought to AI Actions where they will see the OAuth consent screen, and then will be brought back to your site
with an OAuth `code` that can be used with `https://actions.zapier.com/oauth/token/` with the following data in the body with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:
    - client_id: Your AI Actions OAuth client ID
    - grant_type: `authorization_code`
    - code_verifier: The verifier stored for your user when generating the login URL
    - redirect_uri: The same URL you used for the `redirect_uri` in the previous step.

- [Get User Login Link](https://docs.zapier.com/ai-actions/api-reference/auth/get-user-login-link.md): This will create a link that can be used for "quick account creation" for a user.

When going to this link, if the provided email already has a Zapier account, the user will be asked to log in.
If the email does not have a Zapier account, the user will be asked to create an account with the provided email and name.

Upon creating an account or logging in, the user will be taken to the `redirect_to` URL.

A suggested flow for this is:
- Check if you have an AI Actions OAuth token for a user
- If you do not, send the user to a page on your site for initiating PKCE OAuth flow, storing the `code_verifier` for them securely.
- Use this endpoint, with a `redirect_to` of `https://actions.zapier.com/oauth/authorize/` with the following query parameters:
    - client_id: Your AI Actions OAuth client ID
    - scope: `openid nla:exposed_actions:execute`
    - response_type: `code`
    - redirect_uri: The URL on your site that will handle the OAuth callback, must be in the list of allowed redirect URIs for your AI Actions OAuth client.
    - code_challenge: The SHA256 hash of the `code_verifier` from the previous step.
    - code_challenge_method: `S256`

The user will get a Zapier account, be brought to AI Actions where they will see the OAuth consent screen, and then will be brought back to your site
with an OAuth `code` that can be used with `https://actions.zapier.com/oauth/token/` with the following data in the body with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:
    - client_id: Your AI Actions OAuth client ID
    - grant_type: `authorization_code`

When creating a Workflow write action step, field values can be hardcoded, or they can contain mapped values. The mapped values should be surrounded with double curly braces.

In the example request body the Workflow Step contains the field values `email`, `name`, `phone`, and `address` in double curly braces. Then the webhook URL returned can be called with a `POST` request containing a JSON body in the following format:

```
{
"email": "user@example.com",
"name": "John Doe",
"phone": "1234567890",
"address": "123 Maple Lane"
}
```

Note that authentications may become invalid over time, and if this occurs, users will be notified by email to fix their authentication. If the authentication is not fixed, trying to run the Workflow Step will time out. Workflow Steps are also (for now) visible and editable as Zaps at https://zapier.com/app/zaps. If a user turns off a Workflow Step Zap, the request will similarly time out. Finally, it is possible that a user can edit the Workflow Step Zap such that it returns unexpected outputs.

- [Build with CLI](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build-cli/overview.md): Zapier is a platform for creating integrations and workflows. This CLI is your gateway to creating custom applications on the Zapier platform.
- [Action](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/action.md): Every Zap starts with a single trigger that watches for new or updated data, starting the user's workflow. Action steps then make use of that data.
- [Add input fields to triggers and actions](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/add-fields.md): When building in the Platform UI, you'll use the Input Designer to create the form users will input data into, to send to your app's API.
- [Add authentication with API Key](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/apikeyauth.md): API Key authentication passes along a user-entered API Key with every API call. In your Zapier integration using API Key authentication, the API key—and optionally any other data your API needs—is included every time a Zap step runs.
- [Authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/auth.md): Connecting an app to Zapier starts with authentication. Users select an app they wish to use in their Zap, authenticating their account with that app to allow Zapier to access their data.
- [Add authentication with Basic Authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/basicauth.md): APIs using Basic Authentication will authenticate users with a username and password. In your Zapier integration using Basic Auth, Zapier includes the username and password credentials in the API request bundle every time Zapier polls an API endpoint for new data or posts new data to an API endpoint.
- [Reference user-entered details with data bundles](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/bundle.md): Zapier stores data from users' authentication and input forms for API calls in the `bundle` object. You can reference that data in your integration using `{{bundle.bundleName.field}}` text in API requests and connection labels, replacing `bundleName` with the bundle name and `field` with the input field key or API response field key you need.
- [Add an instant trigger using REST Hooks in Zapier Platform CLI](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/cli-hook-trigger.md): REST Hooks are an alternative to polling. The main differences are allowing your customers' Zaps to trigger instantly; and avoiding polling triggers' numerous - and sometimes unnecessary - requests to your API's endpoints to check for new data.
- [Use Code Mode to refine your API call](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/code-mode.md)
- [Use computed fields in OAuth or Session Authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/computed-fields.md): When adding a field in your integration's authentication configuration, Zapier offers two field type options; field and computed field. The field option allows users to enter account information needed for authentication.
- [Compute a field from the data of the Test API call](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/computed-test-field.md): Zapier doesn't store the responses from the test API call for OAuth v2 and session authentication. Using computed fields, you can use data from a test API call later in your Zapier integration.
- [Add a connection label](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/connection-label.md): Zapier users can authenticate multiple accounts for any app. By default, every new app account added to Zapier is identified by the app's name, followed by a number (#2, #3, …) for accounts connected after the first.
- [Add a create action](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/create.md)
- [How deduplication works in Zapier](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/deduplication.md): Zapier automatically deduplicates incoming trigger data for your integration, so that Zaps do not run multiple times on the same data. Consider the following requirements for your “New Item” and “Updated Item” triggers to work as users expect.
- [Add authentication with Digest Authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/digestauth.md): Digest Auth prompts users to enter their username and password, optionally along with any additional data your API requires for authentication. Zapier makes an unauthenticated API call to get the nonce from your server, and uses it to encrypt and pass the authentication data to your server with each API call.
- [Send or receive dynamic user-defined fields through your API](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/dynamic-field.md): Dynamic fields are a type of field built from an API call. Custom code runs to show fields based on other input field data. These are especially useful with project management apps, CRM apps, databases, and any other app where users can add custom, user-defined fields.
- [Use environment variables in your API call](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/env.md): Integrations can define environment variables that are available when the app's code executes. They are useful when you have data like an OAuth client ID and secret that you don't want to commit to source control. Environment variables can also be used as a way to toggle between a staging and production environment during app development and this would be recommended instead of the use of an independent integration for staging purposes.
- [Error: An array is expected](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/error-array-expected.md): When you add a polling trigger or search action to your integration, the Zapier platform [expects a bare array of new or found items returned](/platform/build/response-types), sorted in reverse chronological order. An API may instead return a result _object_ that contains the array of items the trigger/search needs.
- [Error: Got a non-object result, expected an object from create](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/error-non-object.md)
- [Error: Got a non-object result in the array, expected only objects](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/error-non-object-array.md): When using a REST Hook trigger, the data returned by the perform must be an array.
- [Add error response handling](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/errors.md): If your API returns responses with a status code above 400 that should not automatically throw an error then Zapier recommends enabling skipThrowForStatus.
- [Field types](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/field-definitions.md)
- [Use form mode to setup your API calls](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/form-mode.md): In the Platform UI, when building your authentication, triggers and actions, the default setting under _API Configuration_ is to create each component of your integration using Form Mode.
- [Add a REST Hook trigger](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/hook-trigger.md): Set up your REST Hook trigger in the Platform UI with the Settings, Input Designer and API Configuration tabs.
- [Use hydration in Platform CLI](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/hydration-cli.md): The best answer to this lives in our [CLI docs](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/reference/cli-docs#dehydration):
- [Hydration/dehydration limits](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/hydration-limits.md): [File dehydration](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#dehydration) is an extremely useful tool to remain within time and size constraints for Zapier triggers and actions. However, it does have its own limits.
- [Add line item group field to actions](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/line-items.md): Input fields in Zapier add one item each time the Zap runs. But, if you want users to be able to add multiple items in a single Zap run, then this can be achieved by using a line item group. This group takes line items, which are comma-separated values, and adds each instance of the values to the app in a single Zap run.
- [Add authentication with OAuth v2](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/oauth.md): OAuth v2 authentication matches in appearance the login process users expect from most modern apps.
- [Zapier operating constraints](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/operating-constraints.md): Zapier offers a relatively unique run-time environment for your integration and its requests to your API. The environment is stateless and restricts both execution time and payload size to offer normalized reliability and running time. There are three distinct contexts of this run-time that your integration will need to consider.
- [Use pagination in triggers](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/pagination-trigger.md): By default, Zapier triggers fetch new or recently updated data to start Zaps, and only need to find the most recently added items. Triggers can also be used to populate [dynamic dropdown fields](/platform/build/add-fields#dynamic-dropdown), and there they need to find all possible items to populate the field.
- [Add a polling trigger](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/polling-trigger.md): Set up your polling trigger in the Platform UI with the Settings, Input Designer and API Configuration tabs.
- [Reduce requests to your API](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/reduce-api-requests.md)
- [Reorder or remove action](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/reorder-action.md): Whenever a user selects your app's integration in a Zapier action step, they'll see every _create_ and _search_ action in your integration. 
- [Reorder or remove triggers](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/reorder-trigger.md): Triggers are listed in alphabetical order in the Zap editor and this order cannot be changed.
- [Add authentication fields to Request Template](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/requesttemplate.md): The Request Template is a request editor that lets users set static values that apply to all requests made by this integration. Users can configure the URL params, HTTP headers and request body. This is the perfect place to set authentication fields.
- [Response types Zapier expects](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/response-types.md): With every API call, Zapier expects the response data to be returned in a specific response type. This can vary depending on what part of your integration you're working on. Use the table below to identify the correct response type to use
- [Output data, defining sample data and output fields](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/sample-data.md): This guide will explain what output data, sample data and output fields are and how to modify them in your triggers or actions.
- [Add a search action](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/search.md)
- [Add a search or create action](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/search-or-create.md): When adding a _search_ action type, you'll see the option to _Pair an existing search and a create to enable “Find or Create” functionality_ in the _Settings_ page. This embeds the _create_ inside the _search_ step to find or create items in one step of the Zap.
- [Add authentication with Session Authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/sessionauth.md): Session authentication has elements of Basic authentication — where Zapier requests a username and password, and OAuth v2 — where Zapier redirects users to the app's site to allow access. User credentials are exchanged for a token used to authenticate subsequent API calls.
- [Enable static IP address connection for customers](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/static-ip.md): To enable customers to access your integration by static IP address, all outbound traffic from Zapier to your integration will need to be routed through a smaller set of consistent IP addresses. Any app owner/developer can request to enable the static IP address feature on a private or public app.
- [Validate domain and subdomain input fields during authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/subdomain-validation.md): When adding a subdomain input field, commonly used in OAuth implementations, additional validation is strongly recommended to prevent a potential security vulnerability. If not taken into account, an attacker could utilize a maliciously constructed subdomain field (like `attacker-domain.com/`) in order to redirect OAuth connection requests to that attacker-controlled domain (because `attacker-domain.com/.your-domain.com` resolves to the attacker's domain instead of the expected one). Taking the following steps prevents the potential for an attacker to access your integration's sensitive authentication information, such as the OAuth client ID or secret.
- [Test authentication](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/test-auth.md): Testing a user's authentication is crucially important, as it is later used to test subsequent trigger and action steps when built.
- [Test and monitor your integration in your Zapier account](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/test-monitoring.md): Testing inside the Platform UI is crucial during the building process. To ensure users can benefit from your integration's features, it is equally crucial to test your integration within the Zap editor. This is the best way to notice details that might have been overlooked while building your integration.
- [Testing Tools](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/test-tools.md): The Zapier platform provides a set of tools to help inform and validate your integration before pushing changes out to users.
- [Test triggers or actions](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/build/test-triggers-actions.md): Once authentication is tested, trigger and action steps are easy to test inside Zapier visual builder. Set up the trigger or action settings and API calls, then as the last step the familiar _Test Your API Response_ box appears. It will show any accounts you added to your integration previously during the authentication testing.

- [Welcome](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/home.md)
- [Active users retention](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/active-users.md): At Zapier, churn means a user used your integration in their Zaps 29 - 56 days ago, but hasn't run a successful task in one of those Zaps in the past 28 days. This user is considered to have churned from the integration. Maybe they switched to using a competing integration or their workflow had a more periodic or seasonal cadence.
- [Invite team members to your integration](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/add-team.md): Integrations do not have a dedicated owner, instead they are managed by a team that can be modified as needed. Add team members to your integration to collaborate, contribute, and view analytics data for your integration on the Developer Platform. Your integration team can have up to 200 team members, regardless of whether your integration is Private or Public.
- [null](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/api-outage.md): Zapier recognizes that temporary unavailability is sometimes inevitable for your API.
- [Change authentication field keys](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/auth-keys.md)
- [Add required authentication field](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/auth-required.md)
- [Change authentication type](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/auth-scheme.md): If your API's authentication method changes, you would need to change the method Zapier uses to authenticate user accounts.

- [Update perform method for polling trigger](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/change-perform.md)
- [Change trigger from polling to REST Hook](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/change-trigger.md)
- [Clone a version](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/clone.md): Cloning allows you to duplicate an existing version of your integration. This is particularly useful when you want to introduce new features or fixes without altering the original integration. When a previous version of your integration has more than 5 active users, you will need to clone that version to make modifications.
- [Deprecate or delete a version](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/deprecate.md): Deprecation is an optional process that allows you to set a date from which a non-public version of your integration will no longer be updated. Deprecation is only recommended if the older integration version will eventually stop working, such as if the related API will be removed. Zapier is normally a “set it and forget it” experience for users, so use this feature carefully. Only if the older version will no longer function, should it be deprecated. Please note that deprecating a version is significantly more disruptive to our mutual users than migrating to the latest promoted version, or than leaving users on an older (now) private version if migration is not possible.
- [Embed activation rates](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/embed-activation.md): Consider all the user clicks on Zap Templates surfaced in your embeds. The embed activation rate is the percentage of those Zaps that actually activated within 24 hours of creation, meaning the Zap ran at least one successful task. It measures the efefctiveness of the Zapier embeds in your product at converting user clicks on Zap Templates to Zap activations.
