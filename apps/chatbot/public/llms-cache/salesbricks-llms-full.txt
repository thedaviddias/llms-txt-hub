# Authentication
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/getting-started/authentication



To interact with the Salesbricks API, include the `X-SALESBRICKS-KEY` attribute in your request headers. The value for this attribute should be your unique **Public API Token**.

Obtain your Public API Token conveniently under **Settings** -> **Integrations** -> **Public API**.

## Endpoint URLs

Our API is structured with two distinct endpoints:

### GraphQL API Endpoint

`https://api.salesbricks.com/api/v1/graphql`

### Usage API Endpoint

`https://api.salesbricks.com/api/v2/usage`

In most scenarios, you will primarily interact with the **GraphQL API Endpoint**.


# Idempotent Requests
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/getting-started/idempotent-requests



To ensure idempotent requests, include the `X-SALESBRICKS-IDEMPOTENT-OPERATION-KEY` header in your requests to Salesbricks.

<Note>
  This key is crucial for identifying and de-duplicating specific requests, safeguarding against unintended duplication.
</Note>

## Header Key

The header key should be `X-SALESBRICKS-IDEMPOTENT-OPERATION-KEY`.

## Header Value

An idempotency key is a **unique-to-you** value generated by you, the client, which the server uses to identify **a specific request** and de-duplicate it from subsequent retries of the same request.

<Tip>
  How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest including UUIDs or other unique IDs as part of the value to avoid collisions.
</Tip>

Idempotency keys can be up to 255 characters long.

The key should be used to identify the request, not just the data being sent (as even failure requests are saved).

We recommend generating and storing a key per-request-to-Salesbricks (see example below).

## Handling of Duplicate Idempotency Keys

### Subsequent Requests with the same idempotency and same payload

Salesbricks saves the response of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed.

Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result.

This means if you received an error response on a request made with an idempotency key, a following request using that same key will return that same error response.

This is true for any error response, including 500 errors, as long as the request actually made it to Salesbricks' servers.

### Subsequent Requests with the same idempotency key but a different payload

The idempotency system also compares incoming requests to the original request and errors, unless they're the same, to prevent accidental misuse.

If you send a request with the same key but a different payload, you will receive a status code `400` error in response.

### Duplicate Concurrent Requests with the same idempotency keys

If you send 2 requests with the same idempotency key to Salesbricks, the requests will be processed serially, and the one which is processed later will return a status code `409` to indicate a conflict.

## Example Implementation

Let's say you would like to report usage on an order tracked in Salesbricks. Let's also say you track the usage for the order internally using the timestamp at which the usage occurred.

One approach you could take is to create a table called `SalesbricksUsageReportingRequests` in your database, which could look something like:

| DB column name                              | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`salesbricks_idempotent_key` (pk, uuid)** | A **UUID** which is your idempotency key value, that you generate when you make the usage request to Salesbricks |
| **`internal_usage_id` (str)**               | The ID you use to identify usage internally in your system                                                       |
| **`created_at` (optional, timestamp)**      | Timestamp at which you make the request to Salesbricks, for debugging                                            |
| **`response_code` (optional, int)**         | Response code you received from Salesbricks, for debugging                                                       |
| **`response` (optional, jsonb str)**        | Response payload you received from Salesbricks, for debugging                                                    |

Then, when you report your usage, you:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a row in `SalesbricksUsageReportingRequests` storing the `created_at` timestamp, `internal_usage_id` and `salesbricks_idempotent_key`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Make the request to Salesbricks, specifying the `salesbricks_idempotent_key` in the `X-SALESBRICKS-IDEMPOTENT-OPERATION-KEY` header.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Save the response you get back in the `SalesbricksUsageReportingRequests` table.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you got an error response such as a `400`, in which you sent an invalid request where the usage was not successfully reported, you can adjust the sending code to send the correct payload.

Then, retry the steps above, generating a new `salesbricks_idempotent_key` for the new request.


# Overview
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/getting-started/overview



Welcome to the Salesbricks GraphQL API – the gateway to seamless access and management of your subscriptions and orders.

Our API offers a robust, introspectable schema, empowering you to effortlessly explore and interact with its extensive capabilities.

<Tip>
  Before you begin, ensure you have read the [Authentication](/api-reference/getting-started/authentication) guide to find your `X-SALESBRICKS-KEY` and the correct **endpoint** for your use case.
</Tip>

## Setting up an Apollo Client

In this guide, we leverage Apollo Client, extending the example from their documentation [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/networking/authentication/).

```javascript JavaScript
import { ApolloClient, createHttpLink, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';

// discovered using the Authentication guide
const SALESBRICKS_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.salesbricks.com/api/v1/graphql';
const SALESBRICKS_API_TOKEN = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';

const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: SALESBRICKS_API_ENDPOINT,
});

const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      'X-SALESBRICKS-KEY': SALESBRICKS_API_TOKEN
    }
  }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

## Query the schema

Once your client is configured, make queries following the defined schema.

Below is an example query to retrieve all orders:

### Example Query

```javascript JavaScript
client
  .query({
    query: gql`
      query {
        companyOrders {
          orders {
            id
            buyer {
              id
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `,
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Example Response

```json JSON
{
  "data": {
    "companyOrders": {
      "orders": [
        {
          "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
          "buyer": {
            "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "name": "Buyer Name"
          },
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

# Manage My Subscription
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/manage-my-subscription



With the **Manage My Subscription** feature, you can embed a link within your app where your customers can manage their subscriptions (for example, increase license counts or change plans) and manage their payments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather the customer's subscription ID.">
    This is referenced as `subscription_id` within the Webhooks and APIs.

    This data can be captured through our Webhooks (for example, the **order.complete** webhook), or queried using our GraphQL API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build a link within your app where the customer can navigate to manage their subscription." />

  <Step title="When the link is clicked, your system will need to make a call to Salesbricks' GraphQL API.">
    <Tip>
      Insert the **subscriptionId** as the variable within the call below.

      For more guidance with using the GraphQL API, refer to our [API Reference](/api-reference/getting-started/overview).
    </Tip>

    `https://api.salesbricks.com/api/v1/graphql`

    ```graphql GraphQL
    mutation($subscriptionId: String!){
      createSubscriptionToken(subscriptionId: $subscriptionId){
        token {
          id
          expiresAt
          buyer {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The response to this call includes a temporary access token:

    ```json JSON
    {
      "data": {
        "createSubscriptionToken": {
          "token": {
            "id": "546c21827-8009-4f13-933d-22c8c8a9fb9a",
            "expiresAt": "2024-01-05T23:38:16.667405+00:00",
            "buyer": {

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Append the token ID from the response to the following base URL to create the customer-specific subscription link:">
    `https://app.salesbricks.com/subscription-management/` + `<TOKEN_ID>`

    **Example:** `https://app.salesbricks.com/subscription-management/546c21827-8009-4f13-933d-22c8c8a9fb9a`
  </Step>

# Delete a usage entry
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/usage/delete

DELETE /usage
Use this API to delete an existing usage entry.

<Info>
  To use this endpoint, ensure that you are using the `v2/usage` API endpoint:

  `https://api.salesbricks.com/api/v2/usage`
</Info>


# Overview
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/usage/overview



When implementing a usage-based plan for your customers on Salesbricks, you have the flexibility to charge based on two distinct types of usage data: **Gauges** and **Counters**, referred to as **Final value** and **Prorated** in the admin interface.

## Counter / Final value

With **final value** measurement, tally up all billable events over a set time period. This approach is suitable for measuring cumulative usage, such as the total number of API calls in a month.

### Example

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/api-reference/usage/images/final-value.png" alt="final-value" />
</Frame>

Calculation is `sum(billable events) * unit price = total`.

In the illustrated graph,

{/* equation wrapped in dollar signs renders in LaTeX format */}

$$(6 + 4 + 8 + 5 + 3) * \$2 = \$52$$

### Use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Usage">
    Number of API calls used in a month.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exported Documents">
    Count of document exports by a customer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Service Requests">
    Total service requests made by a client.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Gauges / Prorated

With **prorated** measurement, tally up billable events per time unit over a set period. This method is ideal for tracking usage over time, such as virtual machine hours used in a month.

### Example

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/api-reference/usage/images/prorated.png" alt="prorated" />
</Frame>

Calculation is `((billable events * time unit (days), ...) * unit price = total`.

In the illustrated graph,

{/* equation wrapped in dollar signs renders in LaTeX format */}

$$((3 * 6) + (4 * 8) + (8 * 6) + (5 * 3)) * \$2 = \$226$$

### Use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Virtual Machine Usage">
    Number of virtual machine hours used in a month.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subscription Tier Utilization">
    Hours spent in different subscription tiers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Feature Utilization">
    Time spent using specific features within a service.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# order.stage.change
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/webhooks/order/stage-change



<Tip>
  Make sure to read the [Webhooks Overview](/api-reference/webhooks/overview) for important information about signature verification.
</Tip>

## Purpose

The `order.stage.change` webhook is triggered when an **Order** changes its stage, e.g. from `BUILDING` to `CLOSED`.

## Payload format

Your configured endpoint will receive an [Order](/api-reference/webhooks/order/payload) payload.


# order.terminated
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/api-reference/webhooks/order/terminated



<Tip>
  Make sure to read the [Webhooks Overview](/api-reference/webhooks/overview) for important information about signature verification.
</Tip>

## Purpose

The `order.terminated` webhook is triggered when an **Order** has been flagged for termination.

Since termination can be either scheduled or applied immediately, the timestamp in the `terminated_at` attribute of the payload contains the time at which the termination will be effective.

## Payload format

Your configured endpoint will receive an [Order](/api-reference/webhooks/order/payload) payload.


# Overview

Salesbricks provides webhook support, allowing you to extend its functionality by integrating with external systems, services, or custom workflows.

Webhooks enable real-time notifications and data synchronization, enhancing your overall experience with Salesbricks.

## Getting Started

To begin working with webhooks, ensure that you configure and enable the specific webhooks you intend to consume.

You can do this by navigating to **Settings** -> **Integrations** -> **Webhooks**.

</Card>

## Payload Signature

To verify that a payload originated from Salesbricks, a signature will be sent in the `X-SALESBRICKS-KEY` header.

Follow the instructions below to validate the signature:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import hmac
  import base64
  from hashlib import sha512

  def validate_signature(api_token: str, payload: str, header_signature: str):
    """
    :param api_token: Your Salesbricks API Token
    :param payload: the request payload as a string, ex: request.get('body')
    :param header_signature: signature received with payload, ex: request.get('X-SALESBRICKS-KEY')
    """
    import hmac
    from hashlib import sha512
    import base64

    hmac_hash = hmac.new(
      api_token.encode("utf-8"), payload.encode("utf-8"), digestmod=sha512
    )
    expected_signature = base64.b64encode(hmac_hash.digest()).decode()
    if header_signature != expected_signature:
      raise Exception("Invalid webhook signature")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  const express = require('express');
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const rawBody = require('raw-body');
  require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env file

  const app = express();
  const PORT = 3001;
  const API_TOKEN = process.env.API_TOKEN;

  // Middleware to convert the raw payload to a string
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    rawBody(req, {
      length: req.headers['content-length'],
      limit: '1mb',
      encoding: req.charset || 'utf-8'
    }, (err, string) => {
      if (err) return next(err);
      req.rawBody = string;
      next();
    });
  });

  // Function to generate HMAC signature
  function generateSignature(secret, payload) {
    return crypto
      .createHmac('sha512', secret)
      .update(payload, 'utf8')
      .digest('base64');
  }

  // Webhook endpoint
  app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.rawBody;
    const headerSignature = req.get('X-SALESBRICKS-KEY');

    console.log('Received Raw Payload:', payload);
    console.log('Received Header Signature:', headerSignature);

    const expectedSignature = generateSignature(API_TOKEN, payload);

    console.log('Expected Signature:', expectedSignature);

    if (headerSignature === expectedSignature) {
      console.log('Signatures match. Payload is authentic.');
      res.status(200).send('Webhook signature valid');
    } else {
      console.log('Signatures do not match. Invalid payload.');
      res.status(400).send('Invalid webhook signature');
    }
  });

  // Start the server
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Remember to replace the placeholder values (`api_token`, `payload`, `header_signature`) with the actual values from your Salesbricks setup.

  This signature verification process ensures the integrity and authenticity of webhook payloads received from Salesbricks.

# Countersigning
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/countersigning



## Overview

If your customer opts to complete the order via order form, they are prompted to provide an e-signature to begin executing the contract. Once signed by the customer, the order enters the countersigning phase for seller-side approval.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/countersigning/order-form-checkout.jpeg" />
</Frame>

The countersigning process ensures that the order is reviewed and approved by both parties before finalizing. This step is required for fully executing the deal.

### Key events

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/countersigning/buyer-signature.jpeg" />
</Frame>

* Once the customer submits a signature, the deal moves to an "Awaiting countersign" status, which is visible on the Orders view.
* Your org's designated **document signer** is notified to countersign.

## Alerts

Salesbricks provides several notification methods to make sure orders are countersigned in a timely manner:

* **In-app alerts:** in Salesbricks, the document signer receives a notification banner at the top of the app with a list of orders awaiting countersignature.
* **Slack notifications:** a message is sent to the Slack channel configured to track order stage changes.
* **Email notifications:** the document signer receives an email with a link to open and countersign the deal in Salesbricks.

### Best practices

* Verify that you've set the correct document signer under <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings -> Legal</a>. This person will be your org's dedicated countersigner for all transactions completed via order form e-signature.
* Confirm your <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack notifications</a> are fully configured, and that the "Order stage changed" and "Signature required" notifications are landing in the correct Slack channels.

## Reverting the order to Open

If the order is awaiting countersignature, but needs to be revised or corrected for any reason before closing, you can revert the order back to an open state:

**1.** Open the countersignature link.

**2.** On the bottom left corner, click the button labeled **"Revert this order to building."**

**3.** Save your updates and resend the order link to the customer for checkout.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the Salesbricks Support team.


# Custom Billing (Beta)
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/custom-billing



export const BetaFeatureBanner = () => <>
    <Note>
      <h3>This feature is currently in beta</h3>

      <p>We are actively enhancing this feature, and some functionalities may change before the official release.</p>

      <p>If you're interested in joining the beta program and sharing feedback to help us improve it, please ping us in your dedicated Slack channel, or email <a href="mailto:support@salesbricks.com">support@salesbricks.com</a>.</p>
    </Note>

<BetaFeatureBanner />

## Overview

**Custom billing** allows sellers to customize how a customer is billed throughout the duration of a contract. By providing flexibility in invoice amounts and payment collection timing, custom billing can entice prospects with a billing schedule tailored to their needs, while providing sellers with the guardrails to distribute the total contract value (TCV) accurately and seamlessly.

## Key capabilities

**1. Customize invoice amounts within a standard billing schedule**

Set different billing amounts per period (monthly, quarterly, annual) while maintaining the TCV.

**Example:** *Distribute a \$12,000 contract across 3 billing periods with \$6,000, \$4,000, and \$2,000 installments, instead of the default monthly installment of \$4,000.*

**2. Control when the first invoice is sent**

Select from the checkout date or contract start date.

<Tip>
  Click <a href="/quickstart-guide/building-an-order#deal-setup">here</a> to read about why the first invoice date matters.
</Tip>

**3. Manage payment collection timing for credit card transactions**

The customer's credit card will be charged according to the custom schedule.

## Editing an order with custom billing

<Info>
  By default, Salesbricks shows the custom billing schedule on the order form.

  If you would prefer to hide it, please reach out to Salesbricks Support.
</Info>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/custom-billing/order-builder-custom-billing.png" alt="order-builder-custom-billing" />
</Frame>

When editing an open order, simply click the button on the right side of the page labeled **"View/update billing schedule."**

<Warning>
  If you do not see the "View/update billing schedule" button, your order may be set up to issue just one invoice.

  If so, you will need to change the **billing frequency** of the order, under the section titled "Deal Setup."
</Warning>

Any modification to the contract value (upgrades, downgrades, or changes to line items) will prompt a review of the existing billing schedule.

If the new TCV does not align with the existing custom billing amounts, the system will detect the discrepancy and require corrective action.

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Adding new line items">
    Original TCV: \$12,000 (Custom billed: \$6k, \$4k, \$2k)

    Added item: \$3,000

    Issue → The TCV is now \$15,000, but custom billing still sums to \$12,000
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Changing quantities">
    Original quantity: 10 seats at \$100 each

    Updated quantity: 12 seats at \$100 each

    Issue → Custom billing (\$1,000) no longer matches the new TCV (\$1,200)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Resolution

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/custom-billing/custom-billing-resolution.png" alt="custom-billing-resolution" />
</Frame>

When discrepancies arise between the TCV and custom billing amounts, users will be presented with the following options:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><u>Update billing schedule</u></th>
    <th><u>Reset to standard billing and continue</u></th>
  </tr>

  <tr style={{verticalAlign: 'top'}}>
    <td>
      * Redirects to the billing schedule editor
      * Users can reallocate the new TCV across custom periods
      * **Requirement: Adjustments must equal the revised TCV to proceed**
    </td>

    <td>
      * Disables custom billing, reverting to equal payment distribution
      * Users can process the order immediately and re-enable custom billing later
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## How custom billing is displayed on invoices

**Basic calculation formula**

Line item allocation % = `(Original line item amount / TCV) * 100`

Custom period amount for line item = `(Custom period total * Line item allocation %) / 100`

**Example calculation**

Let's say we have a contract with 2 line items and a TCV of \$12,000, distributed across 3 months using custom billing:

* Month 1: \$6,000 (50% of TCV)
* Month 2: \$4,000 (33.33% of TCV)
* Month 3: \$2,000 (16.67% of TCV)

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/custom-billing/custom-billing-modal.png" alt="custom-billing-modal" />
</Frame>

The cost breakdown of the line items is as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><u>Line Item A</u></th>
    <th><u>Line Item B</u></th>
  </tr>

  <tr style={{verticalAlign: 'top'}}>
    <td style={{paddingRight: '2rem'}}>
      * Subtotal: \$9,000
      * Tax (7%): \$630
    </td>

    <td>
      * Subtotal: \$3,000
      * Tax (7%): \$210
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

And here's how the line items will be charged on each invoice:

**Month 1** (\$6,000 - Multiplier: 0.5):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><u>Line Item A</u></th>
    <th><u>Line Item B</u></th>
  </tr>

  <tr style={{verticalAlign: 'top'}}>
    <td style={{paddingRight: '2rem'}}>
      * Subtotal: \$9,000 × 0.5 = \$4,500
      * Tax: \$630 × 0.5 = \$315
    </td>

    <td>
      * Subtotal: \$3,000 × 0.5 = \$1,500
      * Tax: \$210 × 0.5 = \$105
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/custom-billing/custom-billing-invoice-01.png" alt="custom-billing-invoice-01" />
</Frame>

**Month 2** (\$4,000 - Multiplier: 0.3333):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><u>Line Item A</u></th>
    <th><u>Line Item B</u></th>
  </tr>

  <tr style={{verticalAlign: 'top'}}>
    <td style={{paddingRight: '3rem'}}>
      * Subtotal: \$9,000 × 0.3333 = \$3,000
      * Tax: \$630 × 0.3333 = \$210
    </td>

    <td>
      * Subtotal: \$3,000 × 0.3333 = \$1,000
      * Tax: \$210 × 0.3333 = \$70
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/custom-billing/custom-billing-invoice-02.png" alt="custom-billing-invoice-02" />
</Frame>

**Month 3** (\$2,000 - Multiplier: 0.1667):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><u>Line Item A</u></th>
    <th><u>Line Item B</u></th>
  </tr>

  <tr style={{verticalAlign: 'top'}}>
    <td style={{paddingRight: '2rem'}}>
      * Subtotal: \$9,000 × 0.1667 = \$1,500
      * Tax: \$630 × 0.1667 = \$105
    </td>

    <td>
      * Subtotal: \$3,000 × 0.1667 = \$500
      * Tax: \$210 × 0.1667 = \$35
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Key points

* All amounts are rounded to the nearest cent
* Each line item is multiplied by the period's ratio (multiplier)
* Tax is calculated using the same multiplier
* Original tax rates are preserved

<BetaFeatureBanner />

By default, all customer email notifications are sent from `noreply@salesbricks.com`. However, you can easily enhance your brand's credibility and trust by sending emails from your own custom domain.

If your custom domain is still being set up, or if there are any DNS issues, your customer-facing emails will still be sent reliably from the default Salesbricks email address.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up your custom domain to ensure your brand stands out in all customer communications. This simple step can improve email delivery rates and strengthen your brand’s trustworthiness.

While Salesbricks’ default email is highly reputable, using your own domain reduces the chances of your emails ending up in spam folders, making sure your customers never miss important alerts and notifications.

<Info>
  <p>Salesbricks uses Entri to make connecting your domain quick and easy. All you need is your DNS provider login information, and you can complete the setup without leaving the Salesbricks dashboard.</p>
  <p>Entri supports most common DNS providers, so it's very likely your provider is compatible. However, if your provider isn’t detected, feel free to contact Salesbricks support for manual setup assistance.</p>
  <p>See the full list of <a href="https://developers.entri.com/provider-list">DNS providers</a> that Entri supports.</p>

### DNS setup verification

To allow Salesbricks to send emails on your behalf, the following sample CNAME entries will be automatically added to your DNS records:

| Type  | Host                       | Value                                   | TTL |
| ----- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --- |
| CNAME | em1234.example.com         | u123456.wl123.sendgrid.net              | 300 |
| CNAME | s1.\_domainkey.example.com | s1.domainkey.u123456.wl123.sendgrid.net | 300 |
| CNAME | s2.\_domainkey.example.com | s2.domainkey.u123456.wl123.sendgrid.net | 300 |

If the verification is not successful and your domain status is still not **Active**, try clicking the **Check Connection** button again.

## Customer emails

Now that you've set up both your domain and, optionally, the email sender address you want to use, everything should be seamless.

If Salesbricks detects an issue with your domain, you will see a banner notification when you log in to your dashboard. All customer emails will fallback to `noreply@salesbricks.com` until the issue is resolved, ensuring no notifications are missed.

In the [next section](/documentation/customer-email-notifications), you will find a comprehensive list of customer emails that Salesbricks sends on your behalf.

All emails under the Payment and Invoicing category will use the billing sender, while all emails under the Subscription Lifecycle will use the sales sender.

Emails sent to you and your team will continue to come from `noreply@salesbricks.com`.

# Deal Shaping
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/deal-shaping

Best practices to help you and your customer benefit from a partnership and close the deal

**Deal shaping** refers to the process of structuring the terms & conditions of an order strategically, to align with both the vendor's and customer's objectives. Proper deal shaping can significantly improve your company's deal closure rate, can assure a mutually beneficial agreement, and encourages a long-term partnership with your customer.

Here are several best practices to follow when building your orders:

## Commercial Terms

Clear, well-defined commercial terms help customize the agreement with a specific customer, reduce friction during negotiations, and improve the chances of closing the deal.

<Tip>
  Under your company settings, allow commercial terms to be shown during the checkout process (<a href="https://support.salesbricks.com/articles/7053503499-show-terms-at-checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how-to</a>).

  Any time a commercial terms document is added to an order, your customer will be able to review it during checkout.
</Tip>

### Termination Clause

Adding a **termination for convenience** clause to the commercial terms gives both parties clarity and flexibility regarding contract exit points. This could help customers feel more comfortable signing the deal.

* **Termination for Convenience**:

  You grant the customer some flexibility by allowing them to terminate the agreement at their discretion.

  * **Best practices**:
    * Under your company settings, upload a commercial terms document with the termination for convenience clause. This ensures that the clause applies to all orders by default.
    * Customize the clause at the order level if you need it for specific customers.
    * In your commercial terms, specify an opt-out period during which the customer can cancel the contract without any penalty.

  * **Example**:
    *"The customer may cancel the Order Form at any time before or on the 90th day from the start date mentioned in this Order Form ('Cancellable Period'). Any fees paid for the period between the Start Date and the termination date ('Cancel Date') are non-refundable. Unpaid invoices are still due and must be settled."*

### Price Lock Clause

Offering a price lock clause can help customers feel secure in predicting their budget for the duration of the contract.

* **Best practices**:
  * Offer a price lock for a fixed period (e.g. 12 or 24 months).

  * Define whether this price lock applies to all products and services, or just specific components.

  * Clarify what happens after the price lock period ends (e.g. a capped price increase).

  * **Example**:
    *"Customer pricing is locked for 24 months from the contract start date. After this period, pricing may be subject to an annual adjustment not exceeding 5%."*

### Marketing Clause

It's a common practice to include a marketing clause in agreements. This allows the vendor to leverage the customer's brand and reputation for marketing purposes, while also benefiting the customer by boosting their own visibility.

* **Best practices**:
  * Ask for permission to use the customer's logo, name, or quotes in your marketing materials.

  * Offer options for video testimonials or case studies to build stronger social proof.

  * Specify the types of materials (e.g. website, brochures, videos) where the customer's brand may be used.

  * **Example**:
    *"Customer agrees to provide Vendor the right to use Customer's name, logo, and any testimonials or quotes for promotional purposes, including on Vendor's website, case studies, and other marketing materials."*

## Customization and Flexibility

Customization is a key factor when shaping a deal. Vendors that can tailor their agreements and offerings to meet unique customer needs have a higher chance of securing a deal.

### Custom Terms for Specific Deals

While it's important to have default clauses, customizing certain terms for high-value or strategic clients can show flexibility and increase customer satisfaction. For example:

* Add customer-specific renewal terms based on their growth or budget constraints.
* Introduce custom discount structures for multi-year commitments.

## Additional Considerations

When shaping a deal, it's important to consider the following:

### Simplified Pricing Structures

Complex pricing models may deter potential customers from signing contracts. Keep pricing clear, easy to understand, and flexible enough to meet a variety of customer needs.

### Flexible Contract Lengths

Offering customers flexible contract lengths (monthly, quarterly, or annually) can increase the likelihood of closing deals. Consider offering incentives for longer commitments, such as additional discounts or locked-in pricing.

### Renewal Terms

Ensure that renewal terms are transparent. Clearly communicate the conditions under which the contract renews, the notice period required for termination, and any price adjustments that may occur during renewal.

Handling failed payments in Salesbricks

If you've setup your Stripe integration, your customers have the option to pay their invoices electronically.

Most subscriptions have a recurring billing schedule, and it's possible for automated invoice payments to fail mid-subscription.

In these scenarios, Salesbricks provides several features to help your team triage a failed payment event and implement automated responses.

<Frame caption="Viewing the details of a failed payment within Salesbricks.">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/dunning/payment-issue.png" alt="payment-issue" />
</Frame>

Firstly, failed credit card or ACH Debit payments trigger automatic email alerting to your customer's accounts payable and your accounts receivable team. These alerts prompt your customer to update their payment information and pay the invoice using a Salesbricks-powered paywall.

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/dunning/ach-failed.png" alt="ach-failed" />
</Frame>

Secondly, the [invoice.payment.failed](/api-reference/webhooks/invoice/payment/failed) webhook is fired. Depending on the payment terms you've selected for your product, you can choose to take further action - for example, suspending service, or providing an extra in-product prompt about the state of the customer's subscription.

Finally, at the point of invoice reconciliation, the [invoice.payment.succeeded](/api-reference/webhooks/invoice/payment/succeeded) webhook is fired, allowing you to take action - for example, restore service if you've elected to pause the customer's access to your product.

If a payment has been facilitated outside of Salesbricks, you can mark the individual invoice as paid in the Salesbricks admin UI, or automatically do so via a Finance System integration, such as the Salesbricks Quickbooks Integration.

</Frame>

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In Salesbricks, create and publish your pricing and packaging (Bricks, Products, & Plans).

    <Tip>
      You can find details about that process [here](/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/overview).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Navigate to **Settings** -> **Integrations** and click the **Magic Links** card.

    <Card title="Take me there" icon="rocket-launch" href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations">
      [https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations](https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations)
    </Card>

    <Warning>
      If you haven't already built a tailored pricing page on your website, we recommend doing that first, then revisiting this page to have Salesbricks power the buttons of your pricing cards.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Locate the Salesbricks Plan you want to embed onto your pricing page.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/magic-links/magic-links-list.png" alt="magic-links-list" />
    </Frame>

    Copy the Magic Link for that Plan and embed it onto your pricing page.

    When a customer clicks this link on your pricing page, they will be directed to a checkout flow for that Plan in Salesbricks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tracking a Buyer's Activity

In the event that you already know the identity of a user checking out with Salesbricks (e.g. if they're on a free trial of your app and already have a login), you can leverage the **checkout redirect URL** (along with the metadata parameters below) to track when that user has checked out.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Set the checkout redirect URL to a site that you own and can read the URL when the customer checks out.

    Go to **Products** -> click on your Product -> click the **Details** tab.

    Here, you can add or edit your checkout redirect URL.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/magic-links/checkout-redirect-url.png" alt="checkout-redirect-url" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Add your identifier to the end of any Magic Link in this format:

    `<magicLink>` + `&meta_attributionId=<yourUserIdentifier>`.

    The URL should look something like this:

    `https://app.salesbricks.com/products/surveyllama/new?sku=c5938ba7-3d11-439d-ba82-7f764e01cc6f&meta_attributionId=ID123456`
  </Step>
</Steps>

Upon checkout, Salesbricks will redirect the user to your specified URL, attaching your identifier to the end of the URL in this format: `attributionId=ID123456`.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/magic-links/post-checkout.png" alt="post-checkout" />
</Frame>

The URL parameter will also be included in any webhooks triggered, under the field name `metadata`.


# Managing Your Customer
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/managing-your-customer

A primer on Upgrades, Renewals, Recasts, and Terminations

## Overview

Signing a customer's first Order is only the beginning of the customer's contract journey.

Managing that customer's ongoing and future contracts can be just as, if not more important than, the first contract.

Although many tools out there will help you get to the finish line of a deal (think DocuSign, spreadsheets, and Stripe links), that's where it ends.

This leaves Customer Success teams with the burdensome task of unpacking what was originally sold, and turns the task of managing upgrades, renewals, and recasts into a full-time job.

This is not the case with Salesbricks.

Our thoughtfully designed customer management flow empowers CS teams to upgrade, renew, and recast customers with ease, freeing up their time for more strategic tasks.

Gone are the days of second-guessing if the contact attached in Salesforce, or buried in the Box folder, is the latest one; if the customer's entitlements are up to date from their last upgrade; or pinging the Finance team to help prorate a cancel-and-replace contract.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/managing-your-customer/update-subscription.png" alt="update-subscription" />
</Frame>

## Definitions and Examples

### Upgrade

Upgrading a contract involves modifying a customer's entitlements for the remainder of the current contract dates.

#### Example

A customer has subscribed to a block of units and is approaching the upper limit. They would like to purchase the next block of units in order to continue service.

However, they do not want to extend the contract beyond the current contract end date.

The new contract would be effective on the **start date defined in the upgrade**, and remain active until the **end date of the base agreement**.

### Renewal

A renewal contract is a continuation of service for a customer.

If the original order's renewal terms are set to **Automatic**, the contract will be auto-renewed with the same entitlements and term details that exist on the previous agreement (minus any one-time discounts applied).

<Tip>
  In the event that a seller does not want to grandfather the customer into a renewal with current pricing terms, the automatic renewal can be overwritten by creating an upgrade to the subscription prior to the end of the current contract.
</Tip>

#### Example

A customer would like to continue service after their contract end date.

Upon the renewal of the contract, they want to add 50 additional user licenses and 100 professional service hours.

These additional products and services would go into effect on the **start date of the renewal** (typically the next day after the original contract end date).

### Recast

A recast is required when a customer wants to scrap the existing contract and create a completely new agreement with different terms, dates, or entitlements.

#### Example

3 weeks in to a 12-month subscription, a customer has decided that a different Product than the one selected in their current contract would be a better fit for their needs.

They would like to replace the current contract with a new one.

They require that the pre-paid cost of the current contract be applied as a credit to the cost of the new Product. They would like this new contract to extend 12 months from the **start date of the recast**.

### Terminate

A customer would like to discontinue service.

#### Example

A customer is required to reduce their spend and has decided to discontinue their services immediately, or at the end of the contract period.

<Note>
  You can set a subscription to terminate on the renewal date, or any other specified date between now and the end of the contract.
</Note>

# Order Stages

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/order-stages/orders-list.png" alt="orders-list" />
</Frame>

## Open

An order is considered open if one of the following states applies:

* the seller is in the process of building the order (sales-led motion)
* the buyer is in the process of building the order (self-serve)
* the buyer and seller are in the process of reviewing contract terms
* the buyer has not yet completed checkout
* the buyer has not yet signed the contract (when checking out via order form e-signature)

## Awaiting countersign

An order is awaiting a countersignature if the buyer has checked out via order form e-signature and signed. This stage indicates to the seller that their legal document signer must countersign to fully execute the contract.

## Closed won

An order is considered closed won when the buyer and seller have agreed to terms, and the contract has been executed by both parties.

## Closed lost

An order is considered closed lost if the buyer no longer agrees to the purchase.

Closed lost orders will not appear on your Orders table.

## Closed delete

The seller has deleted the order.

Closed delete orders will not appear on your Orders table.

## Migrating

Salesbricks allows sellers to import an order from an external source.

After you migrate an order into Salesbricks, you will have the option of manually marking it as closed won, closed lost, or closed delete.


# Order Types
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/order-types

Understanding upgrades, renewals, recasts, and terminations

## Overview

Now that you know how to [structure your pricing](/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/overview), [build an Order](/quickstart-guide/building-an-order), and [configure customer checkout](/quickstart-guide/checkout-invoice-payment-options), you have all the tools needed to close your first Order.

And if you've already closed your first Order, congratulations! You've officially converted a prospect to a happy customer.

Let's say they want to update their subscription - maybe they need to add more licenses, or they want to extend their one-year contract for two more years.

We support four ways to update an Order after the initial close:

* Upgrade
* Renewal
* Recast
* Termination

Read on to learn the differences between each, and when it's appropriate to use one order type over another.

## Upgrade

<div style={{width: '50%', height: 'auto', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/order-types/upgrade.png" alt="upgrade" />
  </Frame>
</div>

Use an upgrade to **add** more Bricks to a subscription, or to **upsell** the customer to a higher tier Plan.

Any changes will take effect under the current contract dates.

<Warning>
  Upgrades across Products are not allowed.

  If you create an upgrade, you will only be able to choose from Plans and Bricks associated with the Product from the current contract.

  If you're replacing the customer's current Product with a new one, your best bet is to create a [recast](/documentation/order-types#recast) instead.
</Warning>

### Upgrade examples

**Current contract:** Customer has signed a one-year contract for a basic plan, which includes 5 seats at no extra cost.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example A - Add Seats">
    Three months in, the customer decides that they need to add 3 more seats to the subscription, so you build this into an upgrade for the remaining 9 months.

    #### What happens to the current contract after the upgrade closes?

    This example retains the same Plan from the current contract.

    The subscription will be an aggregate of entitlements across the current contract and all subsequent upgrades (5 seats from the initial + 3 seats from the upgrade, for a total of 8 seats).

    Any other contract terms from the current contract will be replaced by the terms defined in the upgrade.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example B - Switch Plans">
    Three months in, the customer wants to upgrade to an advanced plan for the remaining 9 months, which includes 10 seats at no extra cost.

    #### What happens to the current contract after the upgrade closes?

    Since a different Plan was selected, the entitlements from the current contract are replaced by the entitlements of the upgraded Plan.

    Any other contract terms from the current contract will be replaced by the terms defined in the upgrade.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What happens to invoices?

The billing schedule of the current contract is replaced by the billing schedule outlined in the upgrade.

## Renewal

<div style={{width: '50%', height: 'auto', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/order-types/renewal.png" alt="renewal" />
  </Frame>
</div>

Use a renewal to **continue** your customer's subscription.

You may also upgrade the contract (add Bricks or upsell a Plan) when building a renewal.

Any changes will take effect after the current contract has expired.

### Renewal example

**Current contract:** Customer has signed a one-year contract with manual renewal terms (must be agreed upon by the buyer).

8 months later, the customer decides that they are happy with their subscription, and are ready to set up a renewal for another year.

### What happens to the current contract after the renewal closes?

A renewal is a continuation of the customer's subscription under new dates.

The current contract remains active until its end date, after which, the renewal begins.

### What happens to invoices?

The customer will continue to receive invoices according to the billing schedule of the current contract.

Once the renewal begins, the customer will receive invoices according to the billing schedule outlined in the renewal.

## Recast

<div style={{width: '50%', height: 'auto', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/order-types/recast.png" alt="recast" />
  </Frame>
</div>

Use a recast to **replace** the terms, dates, and/or entitlements of the current contract.

### Recast examples

**Current contract:** Customer has signed an upcoming 6-month contract, from March 1st to September 30th.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example A - New Contract Dates">
    Before the contract start date, they decide that they want the subscription to run from March 15th to October 14th instead, so you build these new dates into a recast.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example B - Switch Products">
    Two weeks in, the customer realizes that one of your other Products is a much better fit for their needs, so you build a recast that replaces their current subscription with the new Product.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What happens to the current contract after the recast closes?

The current contract is considered superseded (replaced by the terms of the recast), essentially rendering it inactive.

### What happens to invoices?

The billing schedule of the current contract is replaced by the billing schedule outlined in the recast.

Any amount from the current contract that the customer has already paid, or has been billed for, will be added to the recast as a prorated discount.

## Termination

<div style={{width: '50%', height: 'auto', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/order-types/termination.png" alt="termination" />
  </Frame>
</div>

Use a termination to **end** a customer's subscription.

You may schedule the subscription to terminate on the expected renewal date, or any date before the end of the current contract.

### Termination examples

**Current contract:** Customer has signed a 1-year contract.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example A - Terminate on Renewal Date">
    The subscription is set to auto-renew at the end of the current contract.

    90 days before the renewal date, the customer decides that they no longer want to renew beyond the current contract, so you update the subscription to terminate on the renewal date.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example B - Terminate on Specific Date">
    6 months in, the customer still hasn't implemented the entitlements and asks to terminate the contract at the end of the month.

    You update the subscription to terminate on the last day of the current month.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What happens to the current contract after the termination is scheduled?

Before the termination date, the subscription will remain active, and the customer will continue to have access to their entitlements.

<Tip>
  Salesbricks does not control your customers' entitlements, but we do offer APIs and Webhooks that can integrate into your system to automate the process of disabling entitlements on the termination date.
</Tip>

After the termination date, the subscription will be rendered inactive.

### What happens to invoices?

Customer will continue to be billed until the termination date.


# Payment Communications
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/payment-communications

How to tell your customers that they owe you money

Salesbricks allows you to send your customers an invoice for the Products they've used or have subscribed to.

Salesbricks powers all invoice communications between you and your customer.

Most subscriptions have a recurring billing schedule, so it's possible to automate sending out invoices.

Here are examples of messages that your company admin can customize in the message editor:

### Invoice Sent

# Ramping Structures
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/ramping-structures



## Overview

Ramping is a pricing strategy which is used to gradually increase the cost of a subscription as the quantity of enabled units grows over the course of a contract.

Let's illustrate how ramping schedules work by pricing a single contract against two different pricing structures: **flat-rate** pricing and **tiered** pricing.

## Flat-rate ramping

<Tip>
  Read more about flat-rate pricing <a href="/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-plan#flat-rate">here</a>.
</Tip>

#### Formula for cost calculation

To calculate the subtotal of each ramping period:

`unit price * quantity * duration`

### Example - flat-rate ramping

#### Contract terms

**Start date**: December 14, 2023

**Contract period**: 12 months

#### Ramping schedule

| Ramping period | Start date    | Quantity  |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1st            | December 2023 | 50 units  |
| 2nd            | April 2024    | 100 units |
| 3rd            | July 2024     | 150 units |

#### Pricing structure

\$39 per unit monthly

#### Cost breakdown

| Ramping period | Duration                                      | Cost                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1st            | 4 months (December 14, 2023 - April 13, 2024) | \$39 \* 50 units \* 4 months = \$7,800   |
| 2nd            | 3 months (April 14, 2024 - July 13, 2024)     | \$39 \* 100 units \* 3 months = \$11,700 |
| 3rd            | 5 months (July 14, 2024 - December 13, 2024)  | \$39 \* 150 units \* 5 months = \$29,250 |

#### Grand total

\$7,800 + \$11,700 + \$29,250 = **\$48,750**

## Tiered ramping

<Tip>
  Read more about tiered pricing <a href="/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-plan#tiered">here</a>.
</Tip>

#### Formula for cost calculation

To calculate the subtotal of each ramping period:

* calculate the cost of each tier: `unit price * qty`
* sum the cost of all tiers and multiply by the duration of the ramping period: `sum of all tiers' costs * duration`

### Example - tiered ramping

For this example, we'll use the same contract terms and ramping schedule as the flat-rate example, except now using a tiered pricing structure.

#### Contract terms

**Start date**: December 14, 2023

**Contract period**: 12 months

#### Ramping schedule

| Ramping period | Start date    | Quantity  |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1st            | December 2023 | 50 units  |
| 2nd            | April 2024    | 100 units |
| 3rd            | July 2024     | 150 units |

#### Pricing structure

| Quantity range | Monthly unit price |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1-39           | \$39               |
| 40-79          | \$35               |
| 80-129         | \$29               |
| 130+           | \$25               |

#### Cost breakdown

## Overview

Reports & Charts provides users with visualization and aggregation tools to track various aspects of their revenue and finance data. From revenue and bookings to customer counts and payment status, these reports offer valuable insights into key metrics and trends.

Each chart or report focuses on a different aspect of performance:

**Charts**

* **Revenue:** Tracks total revenue generated each month, broken down by revenue type.
* **Bookings:** Displays monthly sales based on the value of a commercial agreement between a buyer and seller, segmented by customer transaction type.
* **Customers:** Provides insights into new customer acquisition and customer churn.
* **Renewals:** Analyzes subscription renewal amounts and timing, renewal lapses, and churn over time.
* **Invoicing and Payments**: Monitors unpaid invoices and revenue suspended by past due payments.
* **Collections**: Tracks uncollected payments and collected payments over time.

**Reports**

* **Bookings**: Displays monthly sales based on the value of a commercial agreement between a buyer and seller, segmented by customer transaction type.
* **Customer count:** Breaks down the monthly customer count into various categories.
* **Invoice receivable:** Lists all invoices sent to customers within a selected date range.
* **Raw data:** Offers detailed revenue data segmented by [Bricks](/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-brick#whats-a-brick) and Customers.
* **Revenue:** Tracks total revenue generated each month, broken down by revenue type.
* **Revenue waterfall:** Analyzes recurring revenue data segmented by Customers.
* **Tax remittance:** Displays total taxes billed and amounts to remit by state.

## Key Terms

### Subscription Status

#### Renewed

Closed won renewal orders.

#### Terminated

Subscriptions that are scheduled to end before the end date specified on the contract.

#### Churned

Subscriptions that have been terminated, and the termination date has passed.

#### Lapsed

Subscriptions that have ended but have not been terminated, nor has a renewal been closed.

### Revenue

#### MRR

Monthly recurring revenue. Any Brick on an active subscription that the customer is billed for on a recurring basis.

<Note>
  MRR is calculated by dividing the grand total of recurring revenue in an
  agreement by the total contract length in days, and then multiplying it by the
  number of days in each month.
</Note>

#### Recurring

Consistent and periodic income from subscription Bricks.

#### Non-recurring

One-off payments from one-time, usage, and milestone Bricks.

#### Usage

Income from Usage Bricks based on actual usage or pre-committed quantities.

## Charts

The charts listed below offer a single-year view (unless otherwise noted) of your company's revenue data and customer count.

The Revenue chart offers a breakdown of the total revenue your company generated on Salesbricks. It includes monthly recurring revenue (MRR) from recurring, non-recurring, usage, and milestone Bricks on active closed won orders for each month.

It also provides a forecast of future months' revenue based on the expected MRR of active subscriptions.

**Types of Revenue:**

* Recurring
* Non-recurring
* Usage
* Milestone

Clicking on this chart will take you to the [Revenue report](/documentation/reports-and-charts#revenue-2).

Please note that Salesbricks charges usage in arrears; any usage revenue displayed on the chart is based on usage data from the previous month.

### Bookings

The Bookings chart displays the total revenue your company has booked each month.

<Note>
  Monthly totals are calculated by summing up the revenue made from new logos,
  upgrades, recasts, and renewals, then subtracting churned amounts.
</Note>

**Types of Transactions:**

* **New logo:** Closed won initial orders indicating new customers
* **Renewal:** Closed won renewal orders
* **Recast:** Closed won recast orders
* **Upgrade:** Closed won upgrade orders
* **Churn**

Clicking on this chart will take you to the [Bookings report](/documentation/reports-and-charts#bookings-2).

### Customers

The Customers chart tracks the monthly amount of:

* **New customers** from closed won initial orders
* **Churned customers** from terminated orders
* **Existing customers** from active subscriptions

Clicking on this chart will take you to the [Customer count report](/documentation/reports-and-charts#customer-count).

Please note that you are not currently able to drill down in the Customers chart to understand which customers make up the numerical values.

### Renewals

The Renewals chart visualizes the total monthly revenue from renewed, lapsed as potential loss, churned, and upcoming subscriptions.

**Types of Subscriptions:**

* **Renewed:** These appear on the chart during the month in which the renewal agreement starts.
* **Lapsed**
* **Churned**
* **Upcoming:** The expected renewal value will appear on the chart under the month in which the next agreement is expected to start.

Please note that you are not currently able to drill down in the Renewals chart to understand which customers make up the numerical values.

### Invoicing and Payments

The Invoicing and Payments chart monitors your total money due, categorized by how late payments are.

Past-due invoices are segregated into five buckets:

* 1-30 days past due
* 31-60 days past due
* 61-90 days past due
* 91-120 days past due
* 120+ days past due

Clicking on this chart will take you to the [Invoice receivable report](/documentation/reports-and-charts#invoice-receivable).

### Collections

The Collections chart aggregates the total amount of money collected for the selected fiscal year, as well as uncollected payments of all transactions across all fiscal years.

Uncollected money is calculated by the total amount of all unsettled invoices.

Collected money is displayed under three categories:

* Money collected during the **current month**
* Money collected during the **current fiscal quarter** (the consecutive three-month period used for financial reporting and analysis)
* Money collected during the **current fiscal year-to-date** (the start of the fiscal year to today)

Please note that collections are shown based on fiscal quarters, and currently, this cannot be adjusted manually.

## Reports

### Bookings

The Bookings report shows a list of logos and revenue that closed during a selected time range.

Bookings are sorted based on the date the order was closed; if an order was closed in February but set to start in April, it will appear in the report as a February booking.

Churned logos appear under the month that the order was terminated.

### Customer count

The Customer count report tracks customer acquisition and churn rates to determine net customer count changes.

Customers are sorted based on the date the order was closed; if an order was closed in February but set to start in April, it will appear in the report as a February customer.

Churned customers appear under the month that the order was terminated.

This report breaks down your monthly customer count into four quantities:

* **Start of month total:** How many unique logos you had coming in to the start of the month
* **Added this month:** How many new logos you've added
* **Churned this month:** How many logos terminated their subscription
* **End of month total:** How many customers you ended the month with after accounting for new and churned logos

### Invoice receivable

<Warning>
  This report will be replaced by our new <a href="/quickstart-guide/navigating-salesbricks#billing">Billing page</a>.
</Warning>

The Invoice receivable report lists all invoices within a selected date range. An invoice will appear in the report if its "invoice date" (typically, the start of the billing period) falls within the selected date range.

<Note>
  If the filter is set to "year-to-date," and the start of an invoice's billing period has already passed, that invoice will appear in this report.
</Note>

Invoices can also be filtered by customer names and payment status (paid and/or unpaid).

### Raw data

The Raw data report offers a detailed look at all revenue data, segmented by Bricks and Customers, within a selected date range. This data includes subscriptions, one-time payments, usage, and milestones.

Data for this report is filtered by the period that coincides with the report's date range. For example, if a subscription runs from February to December, and the report shows raw data from June to December, the report will only show raw data for this subscription from June to December.

The revenue data shown on each row is the MRR for that Brick, which is calculated by dividing the grand total by the total contract length in days, then multiplying it by the number of days in each month.

### Revenue

The Revenue report displays the total revenue from sales transactions for each month, also segmented into recurring, non-recurring, milestone, and usage revenue.

Data for this report is filtered by the period that coincides with the report's date range. For example, if a subscription runs from February to December, and the report shows revenue from June to December, the report will only show revenue for this subscription from June to December.

### Revenue waterfall

The Revenue waterfall report shows all recurring revenue data, segmented by customers.

This data takes only the recurring revenue from subscriptions into consideration. Monthly revenue allocations are prorated by day.

Data for this report is filtered by the period that coincides with the report's date range. For example, if a subscription runs from February to December, and the report shows revenue from June to December, the report will only show revenue for this subscription from June to December.

### Tax remittance

The Tax remittance report displays the total tax amount billed, and the amounts to remit for each state where you have sold your software and services.

Salesbricks uses Stripe's APIs ([Taxjar](https://www.taxjar.com/)) to determine nexus - whether or not sales tax should be applied to an order based on your company's address and the buyer's address.

As the seller, it is your responsibility to register and remit taxes with each applicable individual state. If you would like assistance with this process, we recommend using our partner, [Zamp](https://zamp.com/).

# Taxed States
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/documentation/taxed-states



## Overview

Sellers have the option to set up tax collection on a state-by-state basis.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/documentation/images/taxed-states/taxed-states.png" />
</Frame>

## Setup

**1.** Sellers can enable or disable tax collection settings through the Finance page:

**2.** Navigate to <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings -> Finance</a>.

**3.** Edit the finance settings.

**4.** Locate the **Taxed states** section.

**5.** Toggle individual states on or off to enable or disable tax collection.

**6.** Save changes to update tax collection preferences.

<Warning>
  All **existing** sellers, by default, have sales tax collection **on** for all states.

  All **new** sellers, by default, have sales tax collection **off** for all states.

  Please read the **Actions** section below for more details and next steps.
</Warning>

## Actions

* **New sellers:** When a seller creates a new account on Salesbricks, tax collection is disabled for all states. They must navigate to the <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finance</a> page to enable tax collection in the states where they wish to collect taxes.
* **Existing sellers:** All states remain enabled for tax collection unless they choose to disable specific states manually.

## Impact of changing state tax settings

* Tax calculation is based on the **nexus** between your company's location and the state in which your customer is located.
* **Enabling a state:** When a seller enables tax collection in a state, the system will automatically begin collecting and remitting sales tax for transactions in that state.
* **Disabling a state:** When a seller disables tax collection in a state, sales tax will no longer be collected for transactions in that state.

Attio is a modern, automation-first CRM platform designed for speed and simplicity. Known for its popularity among young, innovative companies (including many from Y Combinator) Attio is a fast-growing player in the CRM space.

The Salesbricks x Attio integration is a lightweight CRM integration that enables field-level syncing between the two platforms.

## Features

* **Basic field syncing:** Sync key fields from Salesbricks orders to Attio deals.

* **Seamless OAuth connection:** Salesbricks integrates with Attio through a secure OAuth authentication flow, just like our Salesforce and HubSpot integrations.

## Setup

**1. Setup a new Attio integration instance in Salesbricks.**

* In Salesbricks, navigate to <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings -> Integrations</a> and click on Attio.

</Frame>

<Note>
  If you do not see Attio as a CRM option, please reach out to Salesbricks Support to enable it on your account.
</Note>

* If this is your first time connecting Attio to Salesbricks, a modal will appear prompting you to connect your Attio account. Click "Connect."

**2. Complete the OAuth flow by logging into your Attio account.**

* Click "Log in." You will be redirected to Attio for the authentication flow.
* Attio will prompt you to grant access to Salesbricks. Click "Confirm."

</Frame>

**3. Return to Salesbricks, and map the fields you would like to push from Salesbricks orders to the corresponding deal fields in Attio.**

* Click the "Add a field" button to add new rows, or the X icon on the right side of a row to delete it.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/attio/field-mapping.png" alt="field-mapping" />
</Frame>

* Click "Save."

**4. Test a Salesbricks order with a test Attio deal, and confirm the data is flowing properly.**

* In Attio, create a new deal and save.
* In Salesbricks, create a new order.
* In the "CRM Account" field, search for the account associated with the deal you created in Attio.
* Once you find the correct account, the "CRM Opportunity" field will be populated with all deals associated with that company.
* After you save the order, go to Attio and verify that the details from the order were pushed from Salesbricks to the Attio deal.

## Overview

Salesbricks allows you to connect with your HubSpot org so you can:

* Create a new Order in Salesbricks
* Sync metadata from the Salesbricks Order to an associated Deal in HubSpot
* Establish a repeatable process for future agreements between you and your customer

In order to successfully integrate HubSpot in Salesbricks, you will need to:

* Connect your HubSpot instance to Salesbricks
* Create the fields in HubSpot needed to host the Salesbricks data
* Map the integration fields in Salesbricks to the Deal properties you created in HubSpot
* Test a Salesbricks Order with a test HubSpot Deal, and confirm the data is flowing properly

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup HubSpot connection">
    In Salesbricks, go to <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Settings** -> **Integrations**</a> and click on HubSpot. When prompted to proceed, click on 'Connect.'

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/hubspot/hubspot-setup.gif" alt="Setup-connection" />
    </Frame>

    You will be redirected to Hubspot's authorization page. Sign in with your HubSpot credentials and choose the HubSpot account you wish to connect.

    Once the connection has been established, you will be redirected back to Salesbricks to begin mapping your data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the fields in HubSpot needed to host the Salesbricks data.">
    <Tip>
      A list of Salesbricks fields, data types, and definitions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFMW5bvi5YJ0dSyhiw-xWAo7F0JCtPRym3cskCs9wlo).
    </Tip>

    In a new tab, open your HubSpot account and review the Deal properties available in your settings. If needed, you may create custom properties.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/hubspot/deal-properties.png" alt="deal-properties" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map the integration fields in Salesbricks to the Deal properties you created in HubSpot.">
    Back in Salesbricks, map the fields you would like to push from Orders to HubSpot Deals.

    Click the "Add a field" button to add new rows, or the X icon on the right side of a row to delete it.

    <Tip>
      We recommend mapping the following field out of the gate:

      Map Salesbricks Order `Contract Value` to your Hubspot Deal field `Amount`.

      To map additional fields, you can reference our docs on Salesbricks fields for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFMW5bvi5YJ0dSyhiw-xWAo7F0JCtPRym3cskCs9wlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HubSpot</a>.
    </Tip>

    Click "Save."

      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/hubspot/field-mapping.png" alt="field-mapping" />
    </Frame>

    If you are trying to map a Salesbricks field to a "Dropdown select" HubSpot property (For example, **Salesbricks Order Status**), you will have to map each Salesbricks option to an option in Hubspot.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/hubspot/field-mapping-enum.gif" alt="field-mapping-enum" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test a Salesbricks Order with a test HubSpot Deal, and confirm the data is flowing properly.">
    In HubSpot, create a new Deal and save.

    In Salesbricks, create a new Order.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/hubspot/new-order.png" alt="new-order" />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      As you build your Order, [refer to this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVR-48lMOh_R08jjeQOWfjbPAt3fecU0/view) to help you navigate the fields within the Order Builder.
    </Tip>

    In the CRM Company field, search for the Company associated with the Deal you created in HubSpot.

    Once you find the correct account, the CRM Deal field will be populated with all Deals associated with that company.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/hubspot/crm-company-deal.gif" alt="crm-company-deal" />
    </Frame>

    After you save the Order, go to HubSpot and verify that the details from the Order were pushed from Salesbricks to the HubSpot Deal.

    <Note>
      Each time the Salesbricks Order is updated, the updates will be synced to the HubSpot Deal.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Quickbooks
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/integrations/quickbooks

Quickly and easily connect Salesbricks to Quickbooks to automate your invoice, billing, and accounting workflows.

export const ConsecutiveImageGap = () => <>
    <div style={{
  height: '1rem'
}}></div>
  </>;

## Overview

Linking Salesbricks to your Quickbooks Online account allows you to automatically sync invoices, customers, and payments from Salesbricks into Quickbooks.

Salesbricks is the source of truth for customers, invoices, and payments. The Quickbooks integration will only write data into Quickbooks. Currently, it is not designed to read data and updates from Quickbooks.

If a customer pays their Salesbricks invoice through Stripe, or if they checkout directly through Stripe, Salesbricks will automatically push those invoice and payment details into Quickbooks.

If an invoice is paid outside of Stripe (i.e. the customer pays their invoice through check or wire to your bank) the invoice needs to be manually marked as paid within Salesbricks (not Quickbooks). After the transaction is recorded in Salesbricks, the integration will push the payment details automatically into Quickbooks.

## Setup

## Field Sync

Below are the fields that are currently being synced for each object within Quickbooks:

### Invoice Fields

* **Bill Email**: The accounts payable email address the customer inputs when signing the order form within Salesbricks.
* **Due Date**: The date that the invoice is due, based on the order billing terms.
* **Product Line Items**: This includes Bricks sold, units, and amounts. Taxes and discounts are also included.

</Frame>

## Payment Sync

Our Quickbooks integration allows the seamless reconciliation of payments and deposits recorded in QuickBooks with unpaid invoices in Salesbricks. This automation reduces manual effort and ensures accurate financial tracking.

### How It Works

#### Payment reconciliation

Salesbricks reads Payments or Deposits recorded in QuickBooks and automatically applies them to unpaid invoices that are synced between the two platforms.

<Info>
  Only payments tied to existing invoices in Salesbricks will be processed.
</Info>

#### Deposit reconciliation

Salesbricks only reads deposits to bank accounts in QuickBooks.

<Warning>
  Payments categorized as “Undeposited Funds” in QuickBooks are excluded from the sync.
</Warning>

#### Daily sync

The sync runs automatically once a day at 4:00 AM UTC.

### Troubleshooting

# Overview
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/integrations/salesforce/overview



## Overview

Salesbricks allows you to connect with your Salesforce org so you can:

* Create a new Order in Salesbricks
* Sync metadata from the Salesbricks Order to an associated Opportunity in Salesforce
* Establish a repeatable process for future agreements between you and your customer

In order to successfully integrate Salesforce in Salesbricks, you will need to:

* Connect your Salesforce instance to Salesbricks
* Create the fields in Salesforce needed to host the Salesbricks data
* Map the integration fields in Salesbricks to the Opportunity fields you created in Salesforce
* Test a Salesbricks Order with a test Salesforce Opportunity, and confirm the data is flowing properly

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup a new Salesforce integration instance in Salesbricks.">
    In Salesbricks, go to <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Settings** -> **Integrations**</a> and click on Salesforce.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/salesforce/select-salesforce.png" alt="select-salesforce" />
    </Frame>

    If this is your first time connecting Salesforce to Salesbricks, a modal may appear prompting you to reach out to Salesbricks Integration Support for a new integration instance.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/salesforce/send-request.png" alt="send-request" />
    </Frame>

    Once we notify you to let you know your instance is ready, you may return to the Salesforce page in Salesbricks to begin connecting your integration.

    In the meantime, you may proceed to the next step of setting up Opportunity fields in Salesforce.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the fields in Salesforce needed to host the Salesbricks data.">
    <Tip>
      A list of Salesbricks fields, data types, and definitions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J8wWAxeeWno_JbbZj4eeQHh8-HTa3XYYJ15tlzSSCM).
    </Tip>

    In Salesforce, review the Opportunity fields available in your settings. If needed, you may create custom fields.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/salesforce/opportunity-fields.png" alt="opportunity-fields" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map the integration fields in Salesbricks to the Opportunity fields you created in Salesforce">
    In Salesbricks, return to the Salesforce page in Settings.

    If your integration is ready to configure, you will see a screen prompting you to log in to Salesforce via a sandbox or production account.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/salesforce/integration-login.png" alt="integration-login" />
    </Frame>

    After you log in to Salesforce, you will return to Salesbricks where the next screen allows you to select the integration level between your Salesbricks and Salesforce accounts ("Basic" is selected by default).

    Select your integration level and click "Next."

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/integrations/images/salesforce/integration-level.png" alt="integration-level" />
    </Frame>

    Map the fields you would like to push from Salesbricks Orders to Salesforce Opportunities.

    Click the "Add a field" button to add new rows, or the X icon on the right side of a row to delete it.

    <Tip>
      We recommend mapping the following field out of the gate:

      Map Salesbricks Order `Grand Total` to your Salesforce Opportunity field `Salesbricks Grand Total`.

      To map additional fields, you can reference our docs on Salesbricks fields for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J8wWAxeeWno_JbbZj4eeQHh8-HTa3XYYJ15tlzSSCM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce</a>.

## Stripe is for moving money

With its reliability and status as an industry standard, Stripe serves as the backbone for payment processing in Salesbricks. Stripe is integrated seamlessly into the purchasing experience on Salesbricks for payment processing, aka "money movement."

When you connect your Stripe account to Salesbricks, Stripe creates a Connect account that acts as a shared intermediary between your company and Salesbricks. Each time a buyer initiates a payment in Salesbricks, we link the transaction to the associated Customer object in your Stripe Connect account. This setup ensures that both parties have controlled access, without granting Salesbricks full read/write permissions to your primary Stripe account.

<Note>
  Other than payment processing, Salesbricks does not leverage other Stripe objects like subscriptions, invoices, or quotes; these are all functionalities we support within Salesbricks.
</Note>

## Salesbricks is for closing deals

Although Stripe drives the underlying payment infrastructure, Salesbricks offers many features that are designed to empower your B2B SaaS sales team, providing functionalities beyond what traditional Stripe features offer.

### Pricing and packaging

Pricing and Packaging in Salesbricks offers extensive support for pricing models both common and complex. Subscriptions, one-time services, usage-based billing, and percent-based pricing are some of the many features available to help customize pricing for your software or service.

### Deal shaping

Deal shaping in Salesbricks allows for bespoke control of contract periods, payment terms, ramping deal structures, order-specific pricing, discounts, and more.

### Sales-led motions

Sales-led motions are streamlined in Salesbricks, with features such as URL-based order sharing, buyer checkout, electronic payments, auto-generated order forms, and e-signatures developed in-house.

### Order management

Order management involves complicated mid-flight upsells, downsells, renewals, and deal restructuring. Salesbricks simplifies the calculations and workflows so sellers can build orders mid-flight with a few clicks of a button.

### Sales and finance analytics

Robust, interactive reports and charts provide critical insights to how your sales and finance operations are performing. With our Sales and Finance analytics, you get clarity and visibility on how your business is performing just by closing deals on Salesbricks.

Gone are the days of buying tools for your sales team from a dozen different companies – Salesbricks facilitates a seamless journey from building an order to successfully closing deals, empowering your business to drive revenue growth efficiently.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains scenarios you may encounter when configuring payment options or authorizing Stripe payments.

### ACH transactions

**Cause**: New accounts are limited to \$6,000 USD a day and \$10,000 USD a week for the first 4 months after activating your Stripe account.

**Solution**: [Contact Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) and request to raise the weekly volume limit for your ACH transactions.


# Setup

Quick to configure; simple yet powerful integration.

<Tip>
  Learn more about our Stripe integration [here](/integrations/stripe/overview).
</Tip>

## Overview

Linking Salesbricks to your Stripe account allows you to collect payments through **credit card** or **ACH** via Stripe's API.

Once the connection is established, Salesbricks will create a "Connected account" under your parent Stripe account. This is the only account that Salesbricks will have access to manage within Stripe.

Salesbricks leverages Stripe solely to collect payment. It does not use Stripe's subscription or invoicing functionalities. When a credit card or ACH payment needs to be processed, Salesbricks handles all of the logic around subscription, billing frequency, and payment terms, and creates a Customer object within Stripe only.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains scenarios you may encounter when connecting your Stripe account to Salesbricks.

### Integration setup

#### You have a saved business in Stripe but it is not appearing as a selectable option.

**Cause**: If you have a business created in Stripe, but do not see it listed as a selectable option, you likely do not have administrative permissions within Stripe to perform the integration for that account.

**Solution**: Ask the admin/owner of your Stripe business account to add administrative permissions to your user.

During the final step of the buyer checkout process, your customer can select how they would like to execute the order.

You can customize the payment options available to your customer at checkout:

### Order form checkout

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/images/checkout-invoice-payment-options/order-form-checkout.png" alt="order-form-checkout" />

<a href="/quickstart-guide/checkout-invoice-payment-options#order-form-e-signature">Order Form e-signature</a> must be enabled to make this option visible to buyers.

With this option, the customer will need to provide a signatory, the individual authorized to sign the order form in Salesbricks.

If the signatory is the same person as the one checking out, they will be able to review an electronic version of the order form and provide an e-signature.

If the signatory is a different person than the one at checkout, they will receive an email containing a link that leads them to review and sign the order form.

After the signatory has signed the order form, your company's designated **document signer** will be notified to countersign.

<Warning>
  Please note that both buyer and seller must sign for the order to be fully executed and move to closed won.
</Warning>

Customers can also enter a purchase order number and their accounts payable at checkout.

An invoice with net terms applied to the due date will be emailed to the point of contact and accounts payable.

### Electronic checkout

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/images/checkout-invoice-payment-options/credit-card-checkout.png" alt="credit-card-checkout" />

Either <a href="/quickstart-guide/checkout-invoice-payment-options#credit-card">credit card</a> or <a href="/quickstart-guide/checkout-invoice-payment-options#ach-debit">ACH debit</a> must be enabled to make this option visible to buyers.

With this option, no signatures are required to close the order. Instead, buyers must click a checkbox indicating that they agree to your company's terms and conditions.

The customer will receive a receipt via email after the payment is processed successfully.

Payments are billed immediately (net terms do not apply).

Customers will be enrolled in autopay for future payments.

<Info>
  The credit card and bank transfer options are powered by Stripe, and Stripe processing fees may apply.
</Info>

### Pros and cons

When setting up your checkout options, it's important to balance customer convenience with operational efficiency. Here's a quick comparison of using order form vs electronic checkout:

#### Order form checkout

<table className="two-column">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pros</th>
      <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        * **Formal contract execution:** requires both parties to sign a clear, legally binding document that can be referenced down the line.
        * **Streamlined recordkeeping:** signed order forms can reduce disputes and provide clarity in long-term agreements.
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Slower closing process:** collecting signatures can add friction, leading to delays in deal closure.
        * **Invoice management:** without upfront payment, your team may spend more time chasing down payment methods and outstanding invoices.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Electronic checkout

<table className="two-column">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pros</th>
      <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        * **Frictionless checkout:** customers can complete transactions quickly by simply entering payment details and agreeing to your terms.
        * **Immediate payment:** collecting electronic payment methods at checkout reduces the risk of past due invoices.
        * **Lower administrative overhead:** electronic payment processing is automated, freeing up your team to focus on other priorities.
      </td>

      <td>
        * **Less formal documentation:** the customer agrees to your terms by clicking a checkbox. While this motion is as binding as a contract pre-signed by the seller party, a fully executed formal document may offer more peace of mind.
        * **Delayed payment processing:** Bank transfer (ACH processing) may take up to 4 business days.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Which should you choose?

<table className="two-column">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Enable order form checkout if...</th>
      <th>Enable electronic checkout if...</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ...you prioritize a formal B2B purchasing process and fully executed contract
      </td>

      <td>
        ...you prefer automated, scalable transactions with minimal administrative overhead
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Setup

Navigate to <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings -> Finance</a>.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/images/checkout-invoice-payment-options/global-payment-options.png" alt="global-payment-options" />

### Order Form e-signature

This option allows your customers to close via order form.

#### Minimum Total Contract Value required to use Order Form e-signature

If you enable Order Form e-signature, you can also set a minimum TCV (total contract value) amount in order for the customer to select order form at checkout.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/images/checkout-invoice-payment-options/minimum-tcv-required.png" alt="minimum-tcv-required" />
</Frame>

In the image above, the minimum TCV requirement is set to \$1,000. This means that if the TCV of a given order is less than \$1,000, the order form option will be hidden during checkout.

### Credit card

Your customer will be able to pay by credit card during checkout.

### ACH debit

Your customer will be able to pay by bank transfer.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/images/checkout-invoice-payment-options/ach-debit-checkout.png" alt="ach-debit-checkout" />

## Invoice payment options

Each invoice has a clickable link that leads your customer to an electronic paywall powered by Salesbricks.

You can customize the payment options available to the customer at the time of paying the invoice.

Opt in or out of the following options:

### Credit card

Your customer will be able to pay the invoice by credit card, and can save credit card details for future payments.

### ACH debit

Your customer will be able to pay the invoice by providing their bank details, and can save bank details for future payments.

<Info>
  The credit card and ACH debit options are powered by Stripe, and Stripe processing fees may apply.
</Info>

### Wire transfer

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/images/checkout-invoice-payment-options/wire-transfer.png" alt="wire-transfer" />

Include wire instructions on your invoices.

Currently, this option is included by default on all invoices and will reflect the banking information entered under <a href="https://app.salesbricks.com/admin/settings/finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings -> Finance</a>.

<Note>
  Buyers will be enrolled in autopay after their first invoice payment.

# Creating a Brick
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-brick



## What's a Brick?

**Bricks** are a crucial part of your pricing and packaging structure. They are the lowest-level data point within a SaaS transaction where pricing is assigned.

You can think of a brick as a line-item SKU on your transaction.

When checking out at the store, your receipt will have several lines (especially if you're like me and can't stop grabbing things you don't really need). Each line item (block of cream cheese, pellet grill, smart-controlled heated socks, etc) represents a SKU (stock keeping unit).

Just as the name denotes, these are items that you are interested in keeping track of in your SaaS inventory.

## How to Create a Brick

## Schedule

Subscriptions, one-time, and usage (oh my!)

Use the guide below to determine which pricing schedule to select.

<Warning>
  Make sure to get it right the first time, as this cannot be edited after your brick is saved (more on that in a minute).
</Warning>

### Subscription

Use the Subscription payment schedule type any time your customers agree to make a recurring payment in exchange for ongoing access to the Brick.

For example, you may set up your schedule so that users agree to pay for a license to your platform for 12 months.

### One-time

One-time payment schedules are used for non-recurring purchases, such as implementation fees or service hours for services outlined in a statement of work.

### Usage

Usage pricing denotes billing in arrears for software or services consumed, or allowing your clients to `pay-as-you-go`.

Note that Usage Bricks require additional integration for your platform to send usage data to Salesbricks. For usage, you will be presented with two measurement options: `final value` and `prorated`.

#### Final value

Uses a running counter that tallies up total usage over a billing cycle (generally, per month)

#### Prorated

Uses a running counter that tallies up usage over a period of time over a billing cycle (generally, per month)

### Milestone

Milestone payment schedules allow you to defer payment for a task or service until it has been completed.

For example, you may require your customer to complete a virtual onboarding/orientation session. Once you mark this as completed in Salesbricks, the customer would then be invoiced for the milestone.

<Note>
  ### Some pricing options are dependent on the Brick pricing schedule

  Whenever you create a Brick, either **Subscription**, **One-time**, **Usage**, or **Milestone** is set for the Brick schedule.

  Selecting the correct Brick schedule will impact the options available when setting the pricing on the Brick within the Plan.

  For example, if **Usage** is selected you will have the option to input a **pay-as-you-go** and **pre-committed** rate, which can be in fractional cents (not available for Subscription nor One-time purchase schedules).
</Note>

## Why is the Brick framework so important?

Just like when building a brick house (like The Commodores?), your Bricks need to have structure and a framework. The Salesbricks Brick framework restricts SKU proliferation - when an organization creates a new underlying SKU each time an item needs to be sold at a different price point or schedule.

A brick can belong to one or many Products and Plans, as depicted below.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/images/overview/brick-relationship-diagram.png" alt="brick-relationship-diagram" />
</Frame>

Brick pricing is decoupled from from the Brick creation process, and applied when only when adding a Brick to a Plan. This enables your company with the flexibility to innovate on pricing structures, while still allowing those price variations to be tied back to a singular Brick unit.

Without the the Brick framework, obtaining SKU/Brick data for a single Brick across all customers and price variations be a Herculean effort.

With Salesbricks, this data is only a few clicks away.

## What's a Plan?

A **Plan** is a specific offering or bundle of your software and/or services at a certain price point.

Plans can be set up with the following configurations:

* **Many** bricks (Platform, Seats, API call volume, and optional bricks like Implementation Services)
* **One** brick (User Licenses)
* **Zero** bricks (the Plan gives access to the platform)

Each Plan variation can be targeted toward a segment of your customers.

As your customers mature with your offerings (requiring additional licenses, features, etc.), it's extremely easy to upsell them to a higher Plan within Salesbricks.

      ### Do I have to include a Brick on my Plan?

      It is not required to add Bricks to a Plan.

      However, if you are looking to include a quantity of units as part of the Plan (e.g. 5 user licenses included in the Plan price) and would like to charge per additional unit, you must include the unit Brick.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Add Bricks.

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Click **Edit bricks**.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        To add additional Bricks, click the **New brick** button. Check out the [Creating a Brick](/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-brick) guide for details on the Brick builder.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        Select the bricks to be added to the plan by clicking on them.

        </Frame>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Configure your Brick pricing and packaging.

    See the section on [Pricing Structures](/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-plan#pricing-structures) for guidance on structuring the pricing.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Once you've added all the Bricks to your Plan and configured pricing for each, click **Done**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Decide if the plan should be private, and click **Publish**.

    Marking a Plan as private excludes it from any self-serve views and makes it available exclusively through your sales-led Orders.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **One last important step!**

    After publishing your Plan, don't forget to go back into your product and click **Activate**. This will turn your product live for the world (or, at least your team and customers).

## Pricing Structures

A **pricing structure** is a pre-defined discounting mechanism that is designed to incentivize customers as they purchase more of your Product.

There are 4 pricing structures that can easily be designed in Salesbricks:

### Flat-rate

Flat-rate structure is used when you want to **set the unit price equally**, regardless of how many units your customer is buying.

<Accordion title="Flat-rate example - Buying apples 🍎">
  At the grocery store, each apple costs 50¢.

  Frank wants to buy 3 apples: $$\$0.50 * 3 = \$1.50$$.

  Rita wants to buy 100 apples: $$\$0.50 * 100 = \$50$$.

  Under flat-rate pricing, the 1st apple costs as much as the 100th apple, with no discount for having purchased a larger quantity.
</Accordion>

### Tiered

Tiered is a pricing structure where your customers are charged the **sum of each tier** as unit counts reach tier thresholds.

In the example below, there are several pricing tiers and the buyer passes fully through the first two tiers and partially into the third. There are also five licenses included at no additional charge, which are taken from the highest tier.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/images/creating-a-plan/tiered-pricing.png" alt="tiered-pricing" />
</Frame>

<ConsecutiveImageGap />

<Accordion title="Tiered example - Booking a hotel 🏨">
  Tiana wants to book a room at a hotel:

  * The first two nights are priced at \$100 per night.
  * The next two nights are discounted at \$80 per night.
  * Any night after that is \$50 per night.

  Tiana plans to stay for 7 nights: $$(\$100 * 2) + (\$80 * 2) + (\$50 * 3) = \$510$$.

  Under tiered pricing, the buyer's total cost is calculated according to the sum of each respective tier.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  #### Tradeoff to consider when using tiered pricing

  **Pro:** Tiered pricing allows your customers to enjoy a lower per-unit price point as they purchase additional units, while minimizing the overall discount for you as the seller.

  **Con:** Tiered pricing adds complexity to the pricing for your buyers especially when trying to forecast growth and may require additional explanation and support.
</Tip>

### Volume

Volume pricing is used when you want to provide a quantity discount for volume purchases, but want the discounted unit cost to be the **same for all units** in the Order.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/salesbricks/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/images/creating-a-plan/volume-pricing.png" alt="volume-pricing" />
</Frame>

<ConsecutiveImageGap />

<Accordion title="Volume example - Baseball game tickets ⚾">
  Vernon wants to buy tickets to a baseball game:

  * 1-5 tickets: \$50 per ticket
  * 6-15 tickets: \$40 per ticket
  * 16-30 tickets: \$25 per ticket

  Vernon is buying a row of seats for himself and 9 of his friends: $$10 * \$40 = \$400$$.

  Unlike tiered pricing, Vernon is getting the same discount for each of the 10 tickets under volume pricing. Each of his friends owes him the same amount.
</Accordion>

### Block

Block structures are used when you want to **sell your units in blocks instead of individually**.

Similar to buying eggs where you must purchase by the dozen (12, 24, 36, etc.), you can package your units together and sell them in blocks.

This strategy can be useful if your buyer's unit needs to fluctuate within a billing period, eliminating the need for upgrades or overages, assuming they stay within the block.

<Accordion title="Block example - Buying eggs 🥚">
  Bob needs 16 eggs for his recipe.

  At the farmer's market, eggs are sold by the dozen:

  * 1 dozen: \$5
  * 2 dozen: \$8
  * 3 dozen: \$10

  Although he only needs 16, Bob will need to purchase a full 2 dozen eggs at \$8.

  Under block pricing, the seller defines how many units are included in each block.

  The buyer pays for, and receives, the entire quantity of units for the block they purchased.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  #### Pricing guide when building an order

  When activating Tiered, Volume, or Block pricing, a help text icon appears on the order builder to guide both your sales teams and self-service users on the pricing structure (see below for example).

# Creating a Product
Source: https://docs.salesbricks.com/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/creating-a-product



## What's a Product?

A Product can be thought of as your company's price book. Within the Product, you will create Plans and within those Plans, Bricks can be added.

Building within the Product structure allows for versioning and flexibility as you roll out new pricing structures and deprecate old ones.

The diagram below outlines the relationship between products, plans, and bricks:

* Each <a href="/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/overview#whats-a-product">**product**</a> has one or more plans
* Each <a href="/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/overview#whats-a-plan">**plan**</a> has a specific offering of entitlements at a certain price point
* Each <a href="/quickstart-guide/products-plans-bricks/overview#whats-a-brick">**brick**</a> can be reused (added to more than one plan) with distinct pricing for each

## What's a Product?

A **product** can be thought of as a price book. Within the product, you will create plans and within those plans, bricks can be added.

Products can be activated or deactivated as they are phased in or out of use by your team.

As your sales team begins creating orders in the Salesbricks order builder, they are able to select active products under the product dropdown.

## What's a Plan?

A **plan** is a specific offering of your software and/or services at a certain price point.

Plans can include no bricks (where pricing is set for the entire plan), a single brick, or many bricks. Each plan variation can be targeted toward a segment of your customers.

As your customers develop additional depth with your products or require additional features, it's extremely easy to upsell them to a higher plan within Salesbricks.
