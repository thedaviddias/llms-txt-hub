# HuggingFace Integration
After deploying your inference endpoint on HuggingFace, you should see the following user interface:
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/huggingface-deploy-interface.png" alt="huggingface deploy interface"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
On this page, you will need the following information:
* Endpoint URL
* Model Repository
* API token. You can view this by checking the "Add API token" box in the Call Examples code block.
In addition to these, you will also need the context window of your model. This can be found on the model's information page.
After collecting this information, format it into JSON as shown in the example below:
||CODE_BLOCK||json
{
"api_key":"your_api_key",
"endpoint": "your_api_endpoint",
"model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
"context_window": 4096
}
||CODE_BLOCK||
Next, paste this into the Credential field of your integration.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/credential-field.png" alt="credential field"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Once the credential is successfully validated, you should see your HuggingFace model listed in GenStudio's model list:
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/huggingface-model-as-genstudio-model.png" alt="huggingface model as genstudio model"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Scaling HuggingFace Endpoints to Zero
Scaling to 0 is a dynamic feature offered by Inference Endpoints, designed to optimize resource utilization and costs. By intelligently monitoring request patterns and reducing the number of replicas to none during idle times, it ensures that you only use resources when necessary.
However, this does introduce a cold start period when traffic resumes, and there are a few considerations to be mindful of. For an in-depth look at how this feature functions, its benefits, and potential challenges, please refer to [HuggingFace's guide on Autoscaling](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/autoscaling).
### Supported models
At the moment, we only support endpoints for models with a `text-generation` tag that are deployed as `text-generation-inference` containers. We are working to expand our list of supported models.

description: Integration with Amazon AWS hosted databases.
---
# Database Integration
## **Purpose**
\
By adding one or more integrations to public or private databases you enable advanced apps and other capabilities to securely query your data using the power of AI agents.
### **Support**
SkyDeck AI currently supports Postgresql databases and Redshift datawarehouses hosted on AWS. It is not particularly hard to support other data sources, but we did have to start somewhere. If you have another data source you wish to use, please reach out to support to prioritize an integration that meets your needs.
### **Directions**
**The following are the steps to integrate your database with SkyDeck AI:**
1. Obtain or put together a connection URL.
2. Add the connection URL to the Integrations section in Control Center.
3. Assign that integration to a smart tool or AI agent in the Tools section of Control Center.
### Connection URL
If you are lucky, a database admin hands you a ready-to-use standard URL that points to your database. If not, you will need to put one together to add access SkyDeck access to your database. These directions will make that task rather easy.
\
\
To set up a connection URL to a PostgreSQL or Amazon Redshift database hosted on Amazon AWS, you need several pieces of information about your database: the host, port number, database name, username, and password. Here's a step by step guide:
#### PostgreSQL Database
1. **Host**: This is the address of the server where your database is hosted. It should be something like `your-db-instance-name.region-name.rds.amazonaws.com` for AWS RDS PostgreSQL or `your-cluster-name.region-name.redshift.amazonaws.com` for Amazon Redshift.
2. **Port Number**: This is the port on which your database server is listening. The default port for PostgreSQL is 5432, and for Amazon Redshift, it's 5439.
3. **Database Name**: This is the name of the database you want to connect to.
4. **Username & Password**: These are the credentials you need to authenticate with the database.
The general format of a connection URL is as follows:
||CODE_BLOCK||
protocol://username:password@host:port/database
||CODE_BLOCK||
Here's how you can create a connection URL:
1.  Start with the protocol, which is 'postgresql' for PostgreSQL and 'redshift' for Amazon Redshift:
||CODE_BLOCK||
postgresql://
||CODE_BLOCK||
2.  Next, add your username and password, separated by a colon. If your username or password includes special characters, you'll need to URL encode them. For example, if your username is 'user' and your password is 'pass', it becomes:
||CODE_BLOCK||
postgresql://user:pass@
||CODE_BLOCK||
3.  Then, add your host and port, separated by a colon:
||CODE_BLOCK||
postgresql://user:pass@your-db-instance-name.region-name.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/
||CODE_BLOCK||
4.  Finally, add your database name:
||CODE_BLOCK||
postgresql://user:pass@your-db-instance-name.region-name.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/your-database-name
||CODE_BLOCK||
That's it! You've created your connection URL. Be sure to replace 'user', 'pass', 'your-db-instance-name.region-name.rds.amazonaws.com', '5432', and 'your-database-name' with your actual database details.
Remember not to share this URL with anyone, as it contains sensitive information like your username and password.
#### RedShift DWH
The URL for a Redshift database would be very similar, but with a couple of key differences:
1. The protocol would be 'jdbc:redshift' instead of 'postgresql'. This is because JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is commonly used to connect with Redshift databases.
2. The default port for Redshift is 5439, not 5432.
Here's the general format for a Redshift connection URL:
||CODE_BLOCK||
jdbc:redshift://host:port/database
||CODE_BLOCK||
So, if you were to create a connection URL for Redshift, it would look something like this:
||CODE_BLOCK||
jdbc:redshift://user:pass@your-cluster-name.region-name.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/your-database-name
||CODE_BLOCK||
Remember to replace 'user', 'pass', 'your-cluster-name.region-name.redshift.amazonaws.com', '5439', and 'your-database-name' with your actual database details.
### Adding Your Integration
Paste your connection URL in the "Credentials" section of Add Integration. You can select PostgreSQL for either a postgresql or Redshift database. You can use any name you want for the Integration, but we suggest you pick something that will help you identify the specific database associated.

### Accessing Your Data Through SkyDeckAI
Today users can access your database using the Analyst tools available to them in GenStudio. As an admin you can assign an integration to an analyst tool in Control Center's Tools section. You can then assign tags to that tool to ensure only authorized people have access to that tool and its database access in their SkyDeck AI GenStudio workspace.

#### Security Notes
* Create a read-only user (role) on your database to use with your SkyDeck AI integration. SkyDeck does not need write to your system and it is safest if you use credentials that do not have more rights than necessary. However, the user should be able to query the structure of your data system in order to understand it.
* Do not share the access URL as it contains confidential connection information.
* You can limit which users in your organization have access to each database by ensuring that tools that use it, such as a copy of Analyst Bob, are assigned tags that correspond only to uers who you wish to have access.

# Slack Integration
To further enhance team collaboration, you can integrate Slack with Skydeck.ai to let your GenStudio conversations go directly to your Slack channel. This allows your team to collaborate seamlessly.
### Enable Slack from the Control Center
You must have admin access of your Slack workspace to perform this action. In the **Integrations** section of your Control Center, choose **Apps**, and then click the **Add** button of Slack.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/enable-slack-integration.png" alt="enable slack integration"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
After that, you will be redirected to a new page where you can allow SkyDeck.ai to access your Slack workspace. Click Allow and then check the Control Center again to check if Slack has been added successfully. This step is only required by the GenStudio workspace owner or admins. The following step can be done by any user in your workspace.
### Add SkyDeck.ai app to a Slack channel
In your Slack workspace, choose any channel that you want to receive GenStudio conversation messages, and add the **SkyDeck.ai** app to that channel. The channel can be public or private, and each one will have a different way to connect to Slack.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/add-skydeckai-app-to-slack-channel.png" alt="add skydeckai app to slack channel"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Send messages to a public channel
For public channels, SkyDeck.ai has already been able to see all of them after you connect Slack in the Control Center, so you don't have to configure more. Any user in your GenStudio Workspace can choose to connect their conversations to a public Slack channel. Here are the steps they need to do:
1. Choose a conversation in the left sidebar and enable [Collaboration](../../genstudio-workspace/sharing-and-collaboration.md)
2. Toggle the **Share to Slack** button
3. In the **Pick a channel** dropdown, choose a public channel. Ensure that SkyDeck.ai app has been added to that channel as discussed in the previous section.
4. Click the **Send** button next to the dropdown. If successful, you will see new messages in that Slack channel posted by SkyDeck.ai. If you have not added the app, you will see a message right under the dropdown explaining why.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/share-messages-to-slack.png" alt="share messages to slack"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Authorize Slack to send messages to a private channel
For private channels, each user will have to authorize with Slack. The steps are slightly different:
1. Choose a conversation in the left sidebar and enable [Collaboration](../../genstudio-workspace/sharing-and-collaboration.md)
2. Toggle the **Share to Slack** button
3. In the **Authorized applications**, click **Authenticate** right next to Slack. The user will be redirected to a new page to authorize Slack.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/authorize-slack.png" alt="authorize slack"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4. If the authorization succeeds, the **Pick a channel** dropdown will now contain additional private channels that the user is in and has the SkyDeck.ai app. User can now connect their private channel with a GenStudio conversation.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/pick-a-channel.png" alt="pick a channel"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Disconnect the channel
In both cases, if you want to disconnect the channel and the conversation, you can either click the red <mark style="color:red;">**End share**</mark> button in the popup above, or remove the SkyDeck.ai app from that channel.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/end-channel-sharing.png" alt="end channel sharing"><figcaption><p>Click the End share button at the below right corner of the popup</p></figcaption></figure>

# Admin & Owner Tools
The Control Center is a part of the Skydeck.ai system, located at admin.skydeck.ai that is intended for use by account owners and designated administrators. This is where an owner sets up their account and from where they invite users into this system. The Control Center is not normally accessed by users of the GenStudio workspace, although owners and admins may choose to use both. This is the first part of the Skydeck.ai system that is seen by account owners. They may, however, quickly move on to a pre-configured trial of the GenStudio workspace before returning to the Control Center to really get started.

# Organize Teams
In SkyDeck.AI Control Center, tags are a way to organize the members of your company. A tag (or group) represents a team within your organization. You can assign a tag to a member or a tool, and members can only use tools that are assigned the same tag.
Select **Organize** from the sidebar. From this page, you can create tags to define and structure various teams within your organization. You will notice that the **All** tag already exists and cannot be removed. This is the default tag that applies to all members of your organization.

# Edit Members
After adding members to your workspace, you can manage them such as changing displayed names, assigning tags, revoking accesses, etc. Each action may be available or not depending on the selected members and their current states (which is implied by their Guide actions).
### Change displayed name
You can change the name of any member after they are added to your workspace. Select one member from the list, click on the **Edit** button, change the user's name and click **Save**.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-members-popup.png" alt="edit members popup"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Assign Admin role
A member can be granted the admin role, and they will be able to access Control Center of your organization. Select one member from the list, click on the **Edit** button, toggle the **Administrator role** button and click **Save**. Then that user can sign in the Control Center and manage the account.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/administrator-role-toggle.png" alt="administrator role toggle"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Assign tags
[Tags (or groups)](../organize-teams/) are used to curate which [AI tools](../curate-tools/system-tools.md) are accessible by whom. They can also provide groups for analytics and reporting. Members can be assigned multiple tags. Typically tags will define roles or departments in your organization.
There are 2 ways to assign tags to a user.
You can directly assign or remove tags of a user on the member list. Choose one member (without needing to select the checkbox), and in the **Tags** column, click the "+" icon. You can then see the current tags assigned to that member and will be able to assign or remove the tags by simply checking/unchecking the tags. The All tag is enabled by default for all members.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/assign-tags-for-members.png" alt="assign tags for members"><figcaption><p>Assign tags on the member list</p></figcaption></figure>
The second way is to select a member by clicking a checkbox next to their name and click on the **Edit** button. You can then see the same interface as the above option, and you can manage the tags similarly. Once changes are complete, click **Save**.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-member-form.png" alt="edit member form"><figcaption><p>Assigning tags in Edit popup</p></figcaption></figure>
Removing every tag from a member will remove their access to all tools and remove them from all reporting groups. You might wish to do this to limit access to a minimal level. Or to remove a member from global reports. Reports can still be produced for such members by naming them explicitly.
### Revoke access
You can revoke access of your members from GenStudio Workspace, after which they won't be able to it anymore. Select one or several invited members, click on the **Revoke** button and confirm the action. When the access is revoked, the user is still in the member list with the Guide action of **Invite**. You might want to invite them again later, so they are not removed completely.
### Delete a member
If you want to completely remove some members, select them and click on the **Delete** button. Once deleted, they will not appear on the list anymore. You will have to re-add them later if you want to using the [Add member](add-members.md) button.
### Transfer ownership
If the owner wish to transfer the ownership of the account to another user, they can select one admin and click on the **Transfer Ownership** button.

# Import File
Before you import, check that your CSV file has the **name** and **email** fields in the following format:
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UWhLOPa6UdBzO66s17El9htjl_JHS95Y4shkQ9nvuHYo8NlUdvAodSZ8nZ5zNgZbFEg2tjvdRZUm4SFP1rKmXNzoO-zRUzT275VOUNeVqTmyr-2ILt0hfkihnavR3BNzg26VUDHyXklms0eOzTC7Le8" alt="lh6.googleusercontent"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
> **Tip** – Your file must be in CSV format or SkyDeck AI will not accept your import.
***
Select **Import File** tab in the Add member popup. Then click **Upload File** from the pop-up window and locate your CSV file.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/import-members.png" alt="import members"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
If the import is successful, you will see a **Success banner** at the top of the screen, and the page will populate with the new members' information.
{% hint style="info" %}
You can optionally include a third field named **tags** in the CSV file to assign tags to the added members. If not, you can [assign them later](edit-members.md).
{% endhint %}

# Invite Members
After adding members to SkyDeck.AI, they are not able to use your workspace yet. Their current Guide action is **Invite**, which indicates that you as an admin or owner will have to invite them by sending an email.
To invite members to use the [GenStudio workspace](https://eastagile.skydeck.ai/), check the first box next to **Name and Email** to select all members or select individual checkboxes for individual members. Then, the **Invite** button will appear at the top of the page. Click on that button to send email invites to all of the selected members.
In the pop-up window, click **Confirm**.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/invite-member.png" alt="invite member"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
After that, their Guide action will change to **Wait**, which means that you will be waiting for the members' responses. You can also resend the emails for those users if they miss their previous emails. After a member completes their signup process, their Guide action will change to **OK**, and they will be able to access your GenStudio workspace. You cannot resend an email to a member with Guide action of OK.
If the previous link expires, the Guide action will change to **Re-invite**. For more details about each Guide action, please refer to [.](./ "mention").

# Manage Members
## Overview
Select **Members** from the sidebar. From this page, you can manually add members, import member files, send invites to members, and assign tags to members.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/members-page.png" alt="members page"><figcaption><p>Add people to Members to invite them and manage their roles in your SkyDeck AI</p></figcaption></figure>
At the top of the screen you will see guidance about your account in terms of having enough paid seats to invite more members.
## Available Actions
The buttons (Add Member, Export members, Transfer Ownership, Edit, Invite, Revoke, Delete, Cancel) will be active or inactive depending on whether they are relevant to the members you have checked (or not checked) in the list below.
If you have not selected any members then relevant actions at the moment will be to add a single person via email or import a csv file of people to invite, and to export the current members of your workspace.
If you have selected one or more member, some actions are available on the list page such as inviting or revoking access. More advanced features that take up more space to work with are found using the **Edit** button. In particular, this is where Role and Tags can be changed to manage permissions within Control Center and access to tools and integrations via the GenStudio workspace.
All these actions will be discussed more in the following sections, which explain what can be done in the Members page.
## Guide action
In the list of members, pay particular attention to the **Guide** column. This provides a quick suggestion about what you should do next with that particular person.
There are different Guide actions:
1. When a member is added, the Guide action is **Invite**. We need to invite that member.
2. When a member is invited, the Guide action is **Wait**. We need to wait for that member to accept their email invitation.
3. When a member accepts their invitation, the Guide action is **OK**. It is ok now, we don't need to do anything more.
4. When a member's invitation expires, the Guide action is **Re-invite**. We need to re-invite them by sending another email.
5. When a member is revoked, they are still in the list, and the Guide action is back to Invite because you might want to invite them again next.
## Roles
A member can have one or multiple roles, each granting different levels of access to the Control Center and GenStudio Workspace. The roles are defined as follows:
* Member: Grants access to the GenStudio Workspace, provided the user has been invited and has set up their account.
* Admin: Provides access to the Control Center, enabling the management of the account, integrations, security, tags, tools, and members.
* Owner: Includes all admin permissions, plus the ability to manage billing, delete the account, and transfer ownership to another admin.

# Authentication Setup Guide
## Guidance
The members you invite to use the GenStudio workspace need to authenticate themselves when they initially sign up and when they later sign in. You can choose one or more allowed methods that are consistent with the way users normally identify themselves in your organization. Enterprise Single Sign On (SSO) methods are available in advanced plans.
### Google Authentication
If your organization has assigned IDs to your team such as Jane.Doe@yourcompany.com then you should use one (and just one) of our SSO methods. If your organization is a Google Workspace user then choose “Google” as an allowed authentication method.
### Microsoft Authentication
Choose “Azure AD” if your organization uses Microsoft’s enterprise Azure AD (Active Directory) authentication service (soon to start being called Microsoft Entra ID). This usually applies to business or academic deployments of Microsoft oriented SSO. Do not confuse this with the Microsoft individual consumer authentication method called “Microsoft Account” assigned to individuals when they sign up for Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, Xbox, etc. A consumer Microsoft account holder will not be able to sign in with Azure AD.
With Azure Active Directory, Microsoft provides the identity platform as a service but you can modify some of the configuration and settings, such as adding your own custom domain name (to get @yourcompany.com) or requiring multi-factor authentication. Your Azure Active Directory instance is available via the Azure Portal and other management tools like PowerShell, the Azure CLI and the REST API.
### Pick One SSO
If yours is a Google workspace shop, pick Google athentication. If yours is a Microsoft identity service shop, pick AD. This is the “Single” in SSO. It is the way you would primarily want members to sign in and sign up.
### Alternate Authentication
If you do not have any single source of identity, or use a method we do not support (contact us and let us know) then you might choose multiple methods or all methods for authentication. Or if members will join your GenStudio workspace who are not part of your regular organization you will need to choose alternative authentication methods for them to use.
Generally, if your organization uses Microsoft Azure AD, you might choose email or email and Google as supported authentication. If your organization uses Google authentication, you might add email to allowed options.
One downside to allowing alternative authentication methods is that some of your organization members might become confused and try to sign in with an alternative method. You might find it easier to manage allowing only your primary authentication method and providing identities (email addresses) to outside users you invite to your workspace.
**TL;DR**
- Email: Useful for 3rd party users or for hetrogeneous teams.
- Azure AD: The primary choice for organizations with enterprise Microsoft authentication.
- Google: Useful for 3rd party users, hetrogeneous teams, or organizations using Google Workspace.

# Curate Tools
The Tool feature helps to construct more complex prompts easily by asking users for a few brief inputs and then generating the complete, detailed prompt.
Select **Tools** from the sidebar. From this page, you can manage the tools for the entire organization, including uploading, editing, duplicating, and deleting tools. You can also use the tags you created within [**Organize**](../organize-teams/) to determine which AI tools are available to specific groups or individuals.
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ETDbRxZdiQPH3nrVpku_6EYP7FOlgS8BHUF5-euuHuy3rHnVwG5kW2UzOvm10lLK9KN0FDOh5wqpm59cCBxn9tjvMoHk8K7twj6bX_Mec2JP57MxLXdWnVkAc3mnDjIEQIUUegl_ZciqCfINB1XAqD4" alt="lh4.googleusercontent"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

# Assign Tags
Tags allow you to associate the tools with one or many group of members in your organization. After a tag is assigned to a tool, it can only be used by members who are also assigned that tag.
In the Tools page, click on the **Assign** button for each tool you want to manage. In the pop-up window, you can choose multiple tags from the multi-select dropdown. Toggle between selection and deselection for the tags as needed. Then click **Save**.
<figure><img width="563" src="../../../.gitbook/assets/assign-tag-popup.png" alt="assign tag popup"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Repeat this process for each AI tool to create customized permission groups.

# Creating a Privacy Policy
{% hint style="info" %}
**Professional Services:** there are many complex issues that require the expertise of domain specialists or other professionals such as lawyers. Instead of waiting for access to these experts you can get a head start by using SkyDeck.ai GenStudio tools to write an initial draft or proposal that looks like a finished product. Shared with professionals, this can serve as a starting point for discussion, saving time and money. Or kept to yourself, this can serve as a way for you to be highly prepared before you engage with an expert.
{% endhint %}
## Strategy Consultant: Creating Legal Notices
The following conversation with the Strategy Consultant shows how you can use this tool to create a Privacy Policy from scratch that is compliant with European and U.S. privacy regulations.\
\
What we enter into the tool appears in _`italics and blocks`_. The rest is produced by the Strategy Consultant tool and GenStudio using OpenAI GPT-4.
Strategy Consultant
Your questions or prompts:\
\
&#xNAN;_`Help me develop a privacy policy for my generative AI platform for business users.`_
## Thoughts Decomposition:
1. What is the purpose and scope of the generative AI platform?
2. What type of data will the AI platform collect?
3. How will the collected data be used?
4. How will the data be stored and protected?
5. What are the user's rights regarding their data?
6. How will the platform comply with data protection laws?
## Thoughts Generation:
1. The generative AI platform allows businesses to generate AI models for various purposes such as data analysis, prediction, or automation.
2. The platform may collect data such as user information, user interaction with the platform, generated models and their outputs, and other usage data.
3. The collected data will be used for improving the platform, providing personalized service, troubleshooting, and potentially for research and development.
4. The data will be stored securely with encryption and access controls. Regular audits and security measures will be employed to protect the data.
5. The users have the right to access their data, correct inaccuracies, delete their data, and withdraw their consent at any time.
6. The platform will comply with data protection laws by informing users of the data collection and usage, obtaining consent when necessary, and providing mechanisms for users to exercise their rights.
## I want to know more about:
1. Do you have any specific data protection laws or regulations in mind that the platform needs to comply with?
2. Are there any specific types of data that the platform will collect or any specific ways in which the data will be used that haven't been mentioned already?
3. Will the data be shared with any third parties? If so, under what circumstances?
4. Do you have any specific data security measures in mind that the platform should implement?
_`We should comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The platform will additionally collect api keys and credential for access to third party vendor generative AI models for which customers have signed up. Data will be shared with the third party vendors that customers provision on our system. We may also share some data with outside services to support user requests such as urls submitted to direct scraping and ingestion into generative AI models. Site usage data may also be shared anonymously with analytics vendors such as Google to understand customer usage and help improve our product's design. The platform supports the ability for customers to completely delete their entire account and all associated information.`_
## Thoughts Decomposition:
Given the new information, let's decompose the thoughts again:
1. How will the platform comply with GDPR and CCPA?
2. How will the platform handle API keys and credentials for third-party vendors?
3. Under what circumstances and with whom will the data be shared?
4. How will the platform ensure anonymity when sharing data with analytics vendors?
5. How will the platform handle account deletion and data removal?
## Thoughts Generation:
1. To comply with GDPR, the platform will provide clear information about data collection and usage, obtain explicit consent before collecting personal data, allow users to access, correct, and delete their data, and implement data protection measures. For CCPA compliance, the platform will inform users about the categories of personal information to be collected, the purposes for which these categories will be used, and provide a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link to users.
2. API keys and credentials for third-party vendors will be stored securely with encryption, and will only be used for the purpose of providing the service requested by the user. These credentials will not be shared with any other parties without the explicit consent of the user.
3. Data will be shared with third-party vendors as provisioned by customers, and with outside services for specific user requests. The platform will inform users about these data sharing practices and obtain consent where necessary.
4. When sharing data with analytics vendors, all personally identifiable information will be removed or anonymized to protect user privacy.
5. The platform will provide a mechanism for users to completely delete their account and all associated information. This process will include deleting all stored data, including API keys and credentials, user information, and generated AI models.
## I want to know more about:
1. How are you planning to inform users about your data collection, usage, and sharing practices?
2. How will you obtain consent from users for data collection and sharing?
3. Can you provide more details on the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link for CCPA compliance?
4. What steps will the platform take to ensure that all user data is completely deleted upon account deletion?
_`We will inform users about our data collection, usage, and sharing practices through a web page that contains our privacy policy with a link to that page in our footer and our sign up page. 2. We will obtain consent for users for data collection and sharing by asking them to positively check a box which is not checked by default. The user will receive a confirmation of this approval in email when possible. 3. The "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link will describe the data that will not be sold. It will provide a button to press to turn activate this request. When possible users will receive an email confirmation of this request. And the request will remain active for at least one year.`_
## Thoughts Decomposition:
With the new information, let's decompose the thoughts again:
1. How will the platform ensure that the privacy policy is easily accessible to the users?
2. How will the platform implement the user consent mechanism?
3. How will the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link work?
4. How will the platform handle consent withdrawal and the activation of the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" request?
## Thoughts Generation:
1. The platform will keep the privacy policy visible and easily accessible by placing a link to it in the footer and on the sign-up page. The privacy policy will be written in clear, plain language so that users can understand how their data is collected, used, and shared.
2. The platform will implement a user consent mechanism where users have to actively check a box to give consent. This box will not be checked by default, ensuring that consent is given actively and not passively. Users will receive an email confirmation of their consent when possible.
3. The "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link will provide information about what data is not sold and will provide a button for users to activate this request. Users will receive an email confirmation of this request when possible, and the request will remain active for at least one year.
4. The platform will honor consent withdrawals and activations of the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" request promptly. Users will have the ability to change their consent status at any time, and the platform will reflect these changes in its data handling practices.
## Thoughts Evaluation:
The strategy seems to cover all important aspects of a privacy policy for a generative AI platform. It considers the nature of the platform, the type of data collected, user rights, and compliance with GDPR and CCPA.
## Search Algorithm:
The most promising thought to pursue would be to create a draft of the privacy policy based on the generated thoughts and information provided.
## Examples:
Here's a potential starting point for your privacy policy:
"Our generative AI platform is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner. The personal data that we collect and process depends on how you use our services.
We collect and process your data for the purposes of providing you with our services, improving the platform, and for our research and development efforts. We may also share your data with third-party vendors as provisioned by you, and with outside services to support your requests.
We take your privacy very seriously and will always handle your data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA. We will always inform you about how we use your data, and we will only process your data if we have a lawful basis to do so.

# SkyDeck.ai Security Practices
### **Data Security**
* All our components are **hosted within a secure VPC** and data is encrypted at rest with **AWS KMS using AES-256**. Furthermore, we employ **TLS 1.2 or higher** for encryption in transit.
* Our **application secrets** are also securely encrypted at rest with KMS and AES-256.
### Enhanced Conversation Security
In addition to encryption at rest we provide optional enhanced security features around user conversation content and conversation names.
* We can provide a second independent layer of encryption of conversation data at rest. The advantage of this approach is redundant security. But this comes at a cost of an extra layer on decryption when conversations are displayed or used in searches. \
\
This is an option in Control Center for enterprise customers.\
* Every user can hold the encryption keys to their own conversation data at rest. In this way we only have access to their conversation data while they are logged into our system. When they log out, the data is encrypted and we have no record of the decryption key. We use an independent hash of the user's password to implement that encryption. We do not store the password, and the hash exists only while the user is logged in.  \
\
The advantage of this approach is that no one can access user data if the user _simply stops using_ the platform.  The data is effectively gone when not actively in use by the user. The disadvantage of this approach is that if the user loses their password they lose all of their conversation data without any recourse. Another disadvantage is that displaying and working with conversation data will be slower and more _laggy_. Also, changing the user password will be a slower process because all data will need to be decrypted and re-encrypted. \
\
This is an optional feature for enterprise customers.&#x20;
### **Product Security**
* SkyDeck.ai implements regular **penetration testing** and conducts **vulnerability scanning** at crucial stages of our Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
* Our security strategies include both **black-box and grey-box testing** during penetration testing.
* We utilize various methods to ensure the security of our system, including **Static analysis, Software composition analysis, Malicious dependency scanning, Dynamic analysis, and Network vulnerability scanning**.
### **Access Management**
* We leverage **reputed SSO services** for securing our identity and access management.
* Access to applications is role-based and is automatically revoked upon the end of employment.
* Any further access must comply with the policies set for each application.
### **Data Protection**
* We guarantee that all customer data is **encrypted both at rest and during transit**.
* **AWS Key Management System (KMS)** is responsible for managing our encryption keys.
### **Security Education**
* Comprehensive security training is provided to all employees during their onboarding process and is refreshed annually through educational modules within our platform.
* Our team shares regular threat briefings in communication channels to keep them informed of important security updates.
### **Vendor Security**
* We ensure secure remote access to internal resources using **WireGuard**.
* To provide an additional layer of protection, we also use **malware-blocking DNS servers** to safeguard employees and their endpoints while browsing the internet.

# Example: Text-based UI Generator
We are advocates of AI Driven Development as practiced by https://eastagile.com. To support that we use AI to help us develop user interfaces. This tool generates a text-based user interface based on description and an (optionl) request for certain user interface elements. The prompt for the tool asks for design elements as well as appropriate UI text.\
\
This example is presented as a concete and practical example of a tool that one might create and deploy throughout your team.\
\
Here is an example of its usage.\

# JSON Format for Smart Tools
## Overall <a href="#lgmg27qgfdrg" id="lgmg27qgfdrg"></a>
To create a smart tool on SkyDeck.AI, you need to upload a set of files according to the specifications mentioned in the File Structure section. Once uploaded, our platform will perform the initial setup, which may take a few minutes. Afterward, the tool will be available in the GenStudio Workspace.
## File Structure <a href="#id-7dcm0ac78x60" id="id-7dcm0ac78x60"></a>
### \<tool\_name>.json <a href="#xvdq6eic1eed" id="xvdq6eic1eed"></a>
The tool's behavior is also configured through a JSON file. Here is a brief overview of the key fields in the configuration:
* **version**: The current version of the tool.
* **tool\_name**: The name of the tool. This name should be unique in your workspace.
* **tool\_code**: Contains the Python code to be executed. More details on this field will be on the next section.
* **description**: A brief description of what the tool does.
* **usage\_notes**: Instructions on how to use the tool.
* **model\_version**: Specify the models that are allowed to use for follow-up questions. To specify all models, use _\["gpt-4", "gpt-3.5", "claude", "chat-bison"]_.
* **creator**: Information about the creator of the tool, including name, email, and organization.
* **variables**: An array of variables used by the tool. Each variable has a name, description, and default value. The order of variables in the UI follows the order in this array.
* **expected\_output**: The type of output produced by the tool. During the development stage, the value should always be text.
* **avatar\_type**: The format of the avatar used in the tool's UI.
* **timestamp**: The date and time when the tool was last updated.
* **requirements:** specifies the required packages to run the script in tool\_code.
* **avatar**: the string representing the logo of this tool
### tool\_code convention: <a href="#id-177qobv2sfe9" id="id-177qobv2sfe9"></a>
This script outlines the functioning of your tool. The main component of this script is the _execute_ function, which has the following requirements:
* The function should have a single input parameter called _variables_, which is a dictionary. Each key in this dictionary corresponds to a field that the user would input into your tool.
* The function should return a string, which will be displayed as the response on the GenStudio UI.
## Example Tools <a href="#h9o86a5lgfut" id="h9o86a5lgfut"></a>
### Image generation using DALL-E 2 <a href="#quzi31gwxka6" id="quzi31gwxka6"></a>
**Description:**
This tool accepts an image description as input and generates a corresponding URL for the image. The output includes the URL along with an expiration note. The tool functions by sending the query to the OpenAI DALL-E API and retrieving the response.
**Input:**
* Description: Image description, e.g., "A white furry cat"
**Output:**
* A message with the generated URL for the image along with the expiration note.

### Real-time weather report with Open-Meteo API <a href="#yhjv7lbl4mu0" id="yhjv7lbl4mu0"></a>
**Description**:
This tool leverages the Open-Meteo API to provide real-time weather information based on users' questions. By asking a question about the weather, such as temperature, precipitation, or wind conditions, the tool retrieves the most relevant and up-to-date data.
The functioning of this tool relies on APIChain - a feature from the LangChain library - to access the Open-Meteo API documentation. This enables the tool to learn how to make the correct API calls and retrieve the required information seamlessly.
**Input**:
* Question: Ask a specific question about the weather, e.g., "What is the current temperature in New York City?"
**Output**:
* A response providing the requested weather information.

* An icon to visually represent the tool
* Metadata for the prompt:
* A name for the tool
* A description for the tool
* Usage notes for the tool
* Placeholder parameters that are included in the tool string
* Expected output
* Versioning and timestamps.

# JSON format for Tools
## Introduction
This documentation outlines the JSON structures supported by SkyDeck AI for two distinct types of tools: LLM Tools and Smart Tools. The purpose of this page is to provide a brief introduction to these tool categories and their respective JSON structures. Detailed information and examples for each tool type can be found in the corresponding sub-pages.
***
#### LLM Tools
LLM (Large Language Model) Tools are designed to facilitate user interaction with LLM models by sending user input to predefined prompts.
{% content-ref url="json-format-for-llm-tools.md" %}
[json-format-for-llm-tools.md](json-format-for-llm-tools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
#### Smart Tools
Smart Tools extend the capabilities of LLM Tools by incorporating Python code execution for data extraction and processing. The integration of Python enables users to perform complex calculations, data transformations, and other advanced operations beyond the scope of standard LLM Tools functionality.
{% content-ref url="json-format-for-smart-tools.md" %}
[json-format-for-smart-tools.md](json-format-for-smart-tools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
==> genstudio-workspace/web-browsing.md <==
# Web Browsing
Scraping content from websites to include in your prompts is a very helpful feature of GenStudio. Any URL you include in curly brackets will be replaced by the content scraped from that site. For example, you could write "Summarize the most important news from the following \{{https://nytimes.com\}}."
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/web-scraping1.png" alt="web scraping1"><figcaption><p>Web browsing with SkyDeck AI</p></figcaption></figure>

==> genstudio-workspace/conversations.md <==
# Conversations
### Interact with LLM
This is where you interact with your Large Language Model (LLM) Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. You do so in a conversational _chat_ fashion. You can "talk" directly to your models using the "default" tool. This is how your session starts out.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/conversation-start.png" alt="conversation start"><figcaption><p>The beginning of a conversation</p></figcaption></figure>
Start a conversation by clicking the **New conversation** button, or you can resume an existing conversation by choosing one on the Sidebar.
Just ask your LLM anything. These are your "prompts" to the model. But there are best practices you can follow to get better results. For example, just asking for better results can produce better results, for example, "As an expert in physics explaining to a child, explain why the sky is blue."\
\
Your input should be entered in the input field at the bottom of the screen. You submit it to your LLM for a response by clicking the **Ask AI** button on the right hand side of the input field, or by pressing **Enter** while focusing the input.
You can select which model is to be used from the middle menu below the input field. You can change your model choice at any time. Some models will be more appropriate than others. For example, GPT-4 is one of the most advanced models to date and tends to produce more carefully thought out responses. However, Anthropic's Claude models can support much larger context windows (about as much as an entire book) which allows you to submit large documents in your prompt for review, background, or modification.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/models-menu.png" alt="models menu"><figcaption><p>Choose your LLM for different messages</p></figcaption></figure>
### Regenerate and Edit the prompt
If you do not like the result your model produces, you can ask it to regenerate the response using the **Regenerate** button. You can also change your model and send another response.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/regenerate.png" alt="regenerate"><figcaption><p>Regenerate AI response</p></figcaption></figure>
SkyDeck.AI also let you edit your prompt and try again. You can click the **Edit message** button, change the input and resubmit.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/edit-message.png" alt="edit message"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Send non-AI messages
You can also send your messages without asking the AI, and it will just appear like a normal message with no response in the conversation. This is useful when you want to take some notes directly in the conversation, or working with other members (Learn more in [Sharing and Collaboration](sharing-and-collaboration.md)). The non-AI messages will not be included in the conversation history when interacting with LLM.
To send a non-AI message, simply enter the texts in the input field and click **Send chat message** button, or you can press **Ctrl + Enter** while focusing the input.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chat-buttons.png" alt="chat buttons"><figcaption><p>Send chat message (1) and Ask AI (2) buttons</p></figcaption></figure>
### Retrieve the chat content
You can copy all the text of your prompts and responses to your clipboard using the icon in the upper right hand side. This is a handy way to include your work in other documents. You can also download the conversation content into a markdown file by clicking the **Download** button.
<figure><img width="326" src="../.gitbook/assets/copy-download-conversation.png" alt="copy download conversation"><figcaption><p>Download (1) and Copy (2) a conversation</p></figcaption></figure>

==> genstudio-workspace/slack-synchronization.md <==
# Slack Synchronization
By integrating with Slack, you can send your GenStudio conversations to a Slack channel and vice versa. This allows your team to collaborate seamlessly.
{% hint style="info" %}
This page will discuss about how you can synchronize between Slack and GenStudio. To learn more about how to set up Slack, please visit [Slack Integration](../integrations/app-integrations/slack-integration.md).
{% endhint %}
### Sending GenStudio conversations messages to Slack
Once you have connect a conversation with a public or private Slack channel, SkyDeck.AI will send all the current messages to that channel. This will only be done once at the beginning of the connection.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/sync-to-slack.png" alt="sync to slack"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
After that, for every new message that is sent to the conversation, it will also be sent to that Slack channel as well as its response.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/new-message-from-conversation.png" alt="new message from conversation"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Sending Slack messages to GenStudio conversations
To send a message from Slack to the connected conversation:
1. Open the thread of that conversation
2. Tag the **SkyDeck.ai** app and write your prompt.
3. The message will be sent to GenStudio and you will receive the response back.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/new-message-from-slack.png" alt="new message from slack"><figcaption><p>Open the thread (1) - Send a message (2) - Response from GenStudio (3)</p></figcaption></figure>
Here is how the message will appear on GenStudio:
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/gen-view.png" alt="gen view"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Formatting
Markdown does not work automatically in Slack when we send content from GenStudio Collaboration. So you will see `*hello*` instead of \*hello\*. This is a recent change in Slack. But there is a solution. In the desktop app you may manually turn markdown recognition \*on\* in the Advanced settings in Slack.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack-advanced-settings.png" alt="slack advanced settings"><figcaption><p>Select "Format messages with markup"</p></figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack-formatting-improvement.png" alt="slack formatting improvement"><figcaption><p>An example of the improvement seen from turning on "Format messages with markdown".</p></figcaption></figure>
==> genstudio-workspace/public-snapshots.md <==
# Public Snapshots
The snapshot feature provides users with the ability to create a static, comprehensive view of a conversation and share it through a publicly accessible URL. It enhances collaboration by allowing users to disseminate their work quickly and efficiently to your colleagues and even external stakeholders.
### Create a Snapshot
When snapshot of a conversation is created, the system captures the current state of the conversation thread, including messages, timestamps, the LLMs that respond to the messages. Optionally, you can choose to include the participants' names or sharing anonymously. The snapshot is immutable, as it will not be updated when you continue your conversation. If you want to include the new messages, you have to create another snapshot.
To create a snapshot, choose a conversation that you want to share from the left sidebar and click the blue **Collaborate** button in the upper right corner.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot1.png" alt="public snapshot1"><figcaption><p>Click the Collaborate button</p></figcaption></figure>
A popup will appear. Choose the **Share publicly** tab and then click **Create new snapshot**. You have to options: **Share anonymously** or **Share with your name**. Choose the former if you do not want to include your name in the snapshot, and choose the latter if you are willing to share it.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot2.png" alt="public snapshot2"><figcaption><p>Click Create new snapshot and choose a sharing option</p></figcaption></figure>
{% hint style="info" %}
Once created, the snapshot will not include changes from the conversation, such as message addition or deletion.
{% endhint %}
A unique URL is generated for each snapshot so that you can give it to anyone to allow access to the conversation snapshot. The URL generation process employs cryptographic hashing techniques to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of each link.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot3.png" alt="public snapshot3"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Snapshot View
If you choose **Share anonymously**, the participants' names of the conversation will not appear. Instead, you will see User 1, User 2... as the owner of the messages.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot4.png" alt="public snapshot4"><figcaption><p>Anonymized View</p></figcaption></figure>
If you choose **Share with your name**, the participants' names will appear.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot5.png" alt="public snapshot5"><figcaption><p>Unanonymized View</p></figcaption></figure>
{% hint style="info" %}
If you wish to anonymize the participants later, you have to create another snapshot. You can [disable](public-snapshots.md#disable-a-snapshot) or [delete](public-snapshots.md#delete-a-snapshot) the current one later.
{% endhint %}
### Continue from a Snapshot
When someone accesses your snapshot, they are able to continue the conversation from that point. Click **Continue this conversation** at the bottom of the page, and a popup will appear asking for your workspace account.
If you don't have one, you can sign up by entering your email address, and we will guide you through the process of [Setting up an account](../control-center/setup-guide/). After that, you can continue the snapshot once signed up.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot6.png" alt="public snapshot6"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Disable a Snapshot
Users have the ability to toggle the accessibility of a snapshot via the management interface. Disabling a snapshot renders the URL inactive, and any attempt to access the URL afterwards will be responded with not found resources. You can choose to re-enable it later.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot7.png" alt="public snapshot7">"Eye" icon to disable/enable a Snapshot"><figcaption><p>Click the "Eye" icon to disable/enable a Snapshot</p></figcaption></figure>
### Delete a Snapshot
You can choose to delete a snapshot if you don't want to share it anymore. Be cautious that this action is irreversible, which means that you cannot regain the deleted snapshot with the same URL. When clicking the "Trash" icon, you have to confirm the deletion to avoid unintended removal.

# Sharing and Collaboration
SkyDeck.AI is committed to breaking down silos and promoting a culture of collaborative innovation. You don't have to work in isolation when using the GenStudio Workspace. Whether you are working on a general conversation with one of the LLM models or diving deep into one of the six specialized tools for targeted tasks, GenStudio provides a cohesive and intuitive platform for real-time collaboration.
### How to Invite Collaborators
To add collaborators to any existing conversation, select the conversation from the left sidebar and click the blue **Collaborate** button in the upper right corner.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/public_snapshot1.png" alt="public snapshot1"><figcaption><p>Click the Collaborate button</p></figcaption></figure>
A popup will appear with the default tab of **Invite to collaborate**. Toggle the **Collaboration** slider and then click the blue **Copy link** button.
{% hint style="info" %}
Should you wish to discontinue collaboration at any point, simply switch the slider to the off position. Please note that this will invalidate the current link, and it will be different if you generate a new one.
{% endhint %}
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/collaboration-toggle-and-link.png" alt="collaboration toggle and link"><figcaption><p>Enable collaboration and copy the link</p></figcaption></figure>
With this link, you can invite any colleagues with ease. There is no need to add each collaborator's email address manually.
{% hint style="info" %}
All invitees must have an account registered in the same SkyDeck.AI workspace as the conversation owner. This protects organizational assets and confidential information that may be contained within the GenStudio Workspace conversation.
{% endhint %}
{% hint style="info" %}
You can further enhance collaboration by synchronizing Slack channels with your GenStudio conversations. To learn more, please visit [Slack Synchronization](slack-synchronization.md) and [Slack Integration](../integrations/app-integrations/slack-integration.md).
{% endhint %}
### Collaborator View
Collaborators can only see the conversation they have been invited to. They will not be able to see the rest of your GenStudio conversations. To include them in additional conversations, you must provide separate links for each respective dialogue.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/shared-conversations.png" alt="shared conversations"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Invited collaborators can exit a conversation whenever they want by clicking the **Collaborate** button and then the red **Leave this conversation** button.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/leave-conversation-popup.png" alt="leave conversation popup"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Your View
Once a colleague contributes to the conversation, you will see a notification bubble on the conversation in your GenStudio Workspace.
<figure><img width="563" src="../.gitbook/assets/notification-bubble.png" alt="notification bubble"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Each individual's input or contributions will be marked by their respective initials. Hovering over the initials will reveal your colleague's name.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/collaborators-initials.png" alt="collaborators initials"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Working with your colleagues
In GenStudio conversations, not every message needs to be sent to AI. Sending non-AI messages can enhance personal and direct interactions. Whether you're sharing updates, giving feedback, or simply having a chat, relying on non-AI messages ensures clarity and authenticity, allowing for meaningful connections and effective communication without the influence of artificial intelligence.
You can simply send non-AI messages as discussed in this [page](conversations.md), but collaboration enables a more powerful way to interact with you colleagues. When writing a message, you can use the @ notation followed by the member's name to mention them for the next message. This method ensures that specific individuals are alerted about pertinent information, updates, or actions that require their attention. It streamlines communication by directly tagging the involved parties, reducing the chance of important messages being overlooked and ensuring that everyone stays informed and engaged.

# Data Security
## OpenAI API Usage
One of the key advantages of using your OpenAI api key in **SkyDeck AI** is that it **enables private access to OpenAI systems**. If one uses free or paid ChatGPT services OpenAI makes no promises about data security. But if one uses an OpenAI API key in Control Center then all of the chat interaction by your users in GenStudio remains private. \
\
This is what [OpenAI writes](https://openai.com/security) on the subject:\
\
"Data submitted through the OpenAI API is not used to train OpenAI models or improve OpenAI’s service offering. Data submitted through non-API consumer services ChatGPT or DALL·E may be used to improve our models."
==> genstudio-workspace/tools/README.md <==
# Tools
### Introduction
The Tool feature helps to construct more complex prompts easily. Generally, a tool includes one or many input fields, which serve as variables for crafting a more detailed prompt. This simplifies the interaction with AI, as users only need to provide the dynamic content, and our tool handler will take care of the rest. There are two types of tools: **LLM Tools** and **Smart Tools**.
* LLM tools allow users to only need to give some small of inputs, and these will be sent to predefined prompts to be processed by LLMs. Each tool acts as a template that outlines the necessary components of a prompt, allowing users to focus on content rather than format. It is is especially beneficial for users who frequently generate similar prompts and wish to streamline their workflow.
* Smart Tools extend the capabilities of LLM Tools by incorporating Python code execution for data extraction and processing. The integration of Python enables users to perform complex calculations, data transformations, and other advanced operations beyond the scope of standard LLM Tools functionality.
### Usage
To use a tool, click on **Default tool** button below the prompt input field and you will see a list of available tools in the right column of the page. When you click on one of these tools, the input section is modified and you will see the inputs that the tool expects. After you fill these in and submit your choices, the tool will respond with output in your current conversation. You will then fall back into the default conversation mode and you can interact with the response from your tool with replies or follow up.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tools-menu.png" alt="tools menu"><figcaption><p>The Tools menu</p></figcaption></figure>
Within a conversation you might find you benefit from using many tools. You might start with one tool to get strategy advise. Then you might use a SQL tool to write a query to produce some follow up analysis. And finally you might use a writing tool to take your results and write them up in fashion targeted to the audience for your results.
### Define your own tools
In the following sections, we will show you how to use our default tools for your daily tasks. To define a custom tool, learn more at [develop-your-own-tools](../../developers/develop-your-own-tools/ "mention").

# How to Use
To get started with Pair Programmer, you will need to specify programming language you are using or want to use. By default, the field is set to Python.
Once you submit your programming language, you will receive a message similar to the one below (although the exact wording may differ) that details what Pair Programmer has to offer and provides some useful commands:
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pair-programmer-example.png" alt="pair programmer example"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
If everything looks correct, you can then write your programming question into the prompt area.
### /change
The `/change` command allows you to modify your preferences when interacting with Pair Programmer. Currently, it supports two options:
* **Programming language** – Switch programming language. For example, enter `/change language=Java` to switch to Java.
* **Interaction language** – Change the communication language. For example, enter `/change language=Spanish` to switch to Spanish.
### /implement
The `/implement` command is used when you want to create a new program. It follows a five-step procedure to ensure a thorough approach:
For example, you could input`/implement task=TaskDescription`. Please replace `TaskDescription` with a description of the task you want to be implemented.
#### Example
Let's say you want to implement a program that calculates the sum of all elements in a list.
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
||CODE_BLOCK||
/implement task=Create a Python function that calculates the sum of all elements in a list. The function should take a list of integers as input and return an integer as output.
||CODE_BLOCK||
{% endcode %}
### /modify
The `/modify` command is used when you want changes or adjustments made to an existing program. Input `/modify code=ProgramCode modifications=ProgramModification`. Please replace `ProgramCode` with the program you want to modify, and `ProgramModification` with a description of what you want to change.
#### Example
For example, imagine you have a Python function that calculates the area of a rectangle, and you want to modify it to calculate the area of a circle instead.
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
||CODE_BLOCK||
/modify code=
def rectangle_area(length, width):
return length * width
modifications=
Change the function to calculate the area of a circle instead, using the formula `pi * radius^2`. The function should take a single argument for the radius.
||CODE_BLOCK||
{% endcode %}
### /test
The `/test` command is used when you want me to create test cases for a given program. Input `/test code=ProgramCode description=ProgramDescription`. Please replace `ProgramCode` with the program you want to test, and `ProgramDescription` with a description of what the program does.
#### Example
Let's say you have a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number and you want to create test cases for it
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
||CODE_BLOCK||
/test code=
def factorial(n):
if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n * factorial(n-1)
description=
This function calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
||CODE_BLOCK||

# Example – Python Script Assistance
In this example, we are asking Pair Programmer to help with a Python script that is not working as intended in relation to large CSV files.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pair-programmer-input.png" alt="pair programmer input"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
The tool takes a second to analyze your prompt. Every response is customized, so no prompts will have the exact same output. For this prompt, Pair Programmer started with Requirements that reiterated what we asked.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pair-programmer-output-1.png" alt="pair programmer output 1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Sometimes you may ask for a solution that does not exist. Pair Programmer may let you know if it can provide an adequate answer and how the tool is going to answer your prompt.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pair-programmer-output-2.png" alt="pair programmer output 2"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
For our Python script prompt, Pair Programmer is explaining different ways we can modify our script, complete with code examples.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pair-programmer-output-3.png" alt="pair programmer output 3"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Pair Programmer may also provide us some follow-up questions so that AI can understand the specific needs of your situation. You can then ask those questions to request further assistance.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pair-programmer-output-4.png" alt="pair programmer output 4"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Pair Programmer then provides updated strategies that better suit your needs. There may be more follow-up questions. As you answer more questions and provide further information, your output will be more specific. Pair Programmer automatically understands the context for each additional query.

==> genstudio-workspace/tools/image-generator/README.md <==
# Image Generator
Image Generator uses OpenAI's DALL-E model to produce visual content based on textual prompts. Unlike traditional LLMs that generate textual outputs, this specialized model can understand descriptive prompts and translate them into corresponding images.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image-generator-tool.png" alt="image generator tool"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
Its capabilities encompass a wide range of applications, including:
* **Concept Visualization** – Turn abstract ideas or textual descriptions into visual representations.
* **Design Mockups** – Provide a brief, and the model can generate initial design concepts or mockups.
* **Artistic Creations** – Describe a scene, mood, or style, and the LLM can craft a piece of art aligned with that vision.
* **Educational Diagrams** – Generate diagrams or illustrations for educational content based on specific topics or concepts.
* **Entertainment** – Create character designs, landscapes, or any visual content based on fictional narratives or stories.
Image Generator opens up a realm of possibilities for professionals, educators, artists, and enthusiasts, making the process of visual creation more accessible to all. By simply providing a detailed prompt, you can obtain custom visuals without the need for advanced design skills or software.
