# What is Conductor?
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/about

The best QuickBooks Desktop integration on the planet.

Conductor is a real-time, fully-typed API for QuickBooks Desktop (sometimes called QuickBooks Enterprise), available via Python, Node.js, TypeScript, and REST. In just a few lines, get real-time access to fetch, create, or update [*any* QuickBooks Desktop object type](/api-ref) and receive a fully-typed response.

We put a ridiculous amount of effort into making Conductor as amazing as possible. Seriously.

## Key features

# Create an auth session
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/auth-sessions/create

POST /auth-sessions
To launch the authentication flow, create an auth session and pass the returned session's `authFlowUrl` to the client for your end-user to visit in their browser. Demo: https://connect.conductor.is/qbd/demo



# The Auth Session object
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/auth-sessions/object

An auth session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Conductor authentication flow that lets your users connect their accounts to your integration.



# Authentication
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/authentication



The Conductor API uses [API keys](/usage/keys) to authenticate requests.

Your secret API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as Git, client-side code, or a public website.

You must make all API calls over HTTPS. Calls that you make over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    Use your API Secret Key by setting it in the constructor when instantiating the Conductor client or by setting the environment variable `CONDUCTOR_SECRET_KEY`. The Python library will automatically include this key in all API requests. For enhanced security, we recommend using environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials in your code.

    ```ts Example authenticated request
    import Conductor from "conductor-node";

    const conductor = new Conductor({ apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" });

    const endUsers = await conductor.endUsers.list();
    ```

# Missing QBD types
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/missing-qbd-types



Conductor has painstakingly designed 150+ endpoints and **19,000+** parameters and response fields for QuickBooks Desktop.

Yet, there are still some less common QuickBooks Desktop types and endpoints that have not yet been added to Conductor. Below is a list of missing types that we plan to eventually support, but it is a low priority:

1. Custom fields:
   * [DataExt](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/dataextadd)
   * [DataExtDef](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/dataextdefadd)
2. [ItemReceipt](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemreceiptadd)
3. [ItemFixedAsset](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemfixedassetadd)
4. [ItemQuery](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemquery) - which requires adding all the following types (in addition to ItemReceipt and ItemFixedAsset):
   * [ItemSalesTaxGroup](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemsalestaxgroupadd)
   * [ItemPayment](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itempaymentadd)
   * [ItemDiscount](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemdiscountadd)
   * [ItemOtherCharge](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemotherchargeadd)
   * [ItemGroup](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/itemgroupadd)
5. [UnitOfMeasureSet](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/unitofmeasuresetadd)
6. All [reports](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/generalsummaryreportquery)
7. [ARRefundCreditCard](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop/arrefundcreditcardadd)

There are even more types beyond those listed above ([see the full list here](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop)), but they are so rare that no one has requested them.

If you desperately need Conductor to support one of the missing types, please email us at [support@conductor.is](mailto:support@conductor.is?subject=Missing%20QBD%20types). Priority will be given to paying customers.


# Pagination
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/pagination

Learn how to efficiently retrieve large datasets in API v2 from QuickBooks Desktop using cursor-based pagination.

Conductor's QuickBooks Desktop API v2 uses cursor-based pagination to handle large datasets efficiently, allowing you to retrieve results in manageable chunks. This guide explains how to implement pagination and its key limitations.

## How pagination works

For list endpoints that support pagination (indicated by the presence of a `cursor` query parameter in the API specification), the process works as follows:

1. Make your initial request to the list endpoint without a cursor.

   * Use the `limit` query parameter to control how many items are returned per page.
     * The default and maximum value is `150` items per page. We enforce this limit to prevent overloading QuickBooks Desktop.

2. The response will contain the following pagination fields:

   * `nextCursor` - The cursor value to use when requesting the next page of results. This field is `null` if there are no more pages.
   * `hasMore` - Indicates whether there are more pages of results available.
   * `remainingCount` - The number of remaining items that can be retrieved in subsequent pages.

3. To fetch the next page, make another request with the `cursor` query parameter set to the `nextCursor` value from the previous response.

   <Warning>
     **You must make subsequent pagination requests within 10 seconds of
     receiving the previous response.** If you exceed this time limit, you'll
     receive an error.
   </Warning>

   * This limitation is inherent to QuickBooks Desktop's design.

   * While this is not an issue when using code to automatically fetch pages in sequence (e.g., in a loop), it may affect manual API testing where you're copying and pasting cursor values between requests.

4. Repeat until `hasMore` is `false`.

5. Attempting to request another page when `hasMore` is `false` will result in an error.

## Important limitations

### Same `cursor` value used for all pages

The `cursor` value remains constant throughout the entire pagination sequence. This means you should reuse the same cursor value for all subsequent requests in the sequence, which is a design characteristic inherent to the QuickBooks Desktop system.

### No custom sorting available

The order of results is determined entirely by QuickBooks Desktop, and no information about the ordering is provided in the response. Due to this limitation, custom sorting of results is not supported through the API.

### Non-paginated endpoints

Some QuickBooks Desktop list APIs do not support pagination due to limitations in QuickBooks Desktop itself. These endpoints can be identified by the absence of the `cursor` parameter in their API specification. This typically applies to endpoints where the end-user is highly unlikely to have a large set of objects of that type, so the absence of pagination will not impact performance.

## Pagination in Conductor SDKs

Our official client libraries handle pagination automatically, making it easier to work with paginated responses. Check out their documentation for implementation details:

* [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-node?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-pagination)
* [Python SDK](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-python?tab=readme-ov-file#pagination)

## Example

1. Initial request:

   ```http
   GET https://api.conductor.is/v1/quickbooks_desktop/customers
   ```

   ```json Example initial response
   {
     "data": [...],
     "nextCursor": "abc123",
     "hasMore": true,
     "remainingCount": 99
   }
   ```

2. Next page request with `cursor` query parameter:

   ```http
   GET https://api.conductor.is/v1/quickbooks_desktop/customers?cursor=abc123
   ```

   ```json Example next page response
   {
     "data": [...],
     "nextCursor": "abc123",
     "hasMore": false,
     "remainingCount": 0
   }
   ```

3. Requesting another page after `hasMore` is `false` will result in an error:

   ```http
   GET https://api.conductor.is/v1/quickbooks_desktop/customers?cursor=abc123
   ```

   ```json Example error response
   {
     "error": {
       "message": "No more results available"
       // ...
     }
   }
   ```

A vendor credit (also known as a bill credit) represents money that a vendor owes back to your business, typically from overpayment or returned merchandise. When processing bill payments, you can apply these credits via `applyToTransactions.setCredit` to reduce payment amounts. Note that vendor credits track money owed by vendors, while credit memos track money you owe customers and are handled through receive-payment transactions.



# Retrieve a vendor credit
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendor-credits/retrieve

GET /quickbooks-desktop/vendor-credits/{id}
Retrieves a vendor credit by ID.



# Update a vendor credit
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendor-credits/update

POST /quickbooks-desktop/vendor-credits/{id}
Updates an existing vendor credit.



# Create a vendor
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendors/create

POST /quickbooks-desktop/vendors
Creates a new vendor.



# List all vendors
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendors/list

GET /quickbooks-desktop/vendors
Returns a list of vendors. Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through the results.



# The Vendor object
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendors/object

A vendor is any person or company from whom a small business owner buys goods and services. (Banks and tax agencies usually are included on the vendor list.) A company's vendor list contains information such as account balance and contact information about each vendor.



# Retrieve a vendor
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendors/retrieve

GET /quickbooks-desktop/vendors/{id}
Retrieves a vendor by ID.



# Update a vendor
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/qbd/vendors/update

POST /quickbooks-desktop/vendors/{id}
Updates an existing vendor.



# Request IDs
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/request-ids



Each API request has an associated unique identifier. This identifier is returned in the response headers as `Conductor-Request-Id`. You can use this identifier to track the request in the logs. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.


# SDKs
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/sdks

Check out Conductor's official Node.js and Python SDKs for integrating with the QuickBooks Desktop API.

Conductor provides powerful, fully-typed SDKs for **Node.js** and **Python** that provides a top-tier developer experience for integrating QuickBooks Desktop. Both SDKs provide:

* Full API coverage
* Type safety and autocomplete for every endpoint, parameter, and response field
* Inline docs for all fields and methods
* Automatic request retries
* Comprehensive error handling
* async/await operations
* Modern API design patterns

# Node.js SDK

See the [Node.js SDK Documentation](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-node) for more details.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install conductor-node@beta
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add conductor-node@beta
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add conductor-node@beta
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Though this version of the Node.js SDK uses an NPM `@beta` tag, it ***is* stable and ready for production use**! We merely have a few more endpoints to migrate before prompting all existing users to update. **Any new Conductor users should absolutely use the beta version**!

  If you're migrating from the old `conductor-node` package, please see the [upgrade guide](/api-ref/upgrade-node).
</Info>

```ts
import Conductor from "conductor-node";

const conductor = new Conductor({ apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" });

async function main() {
  // Fetch the first page of invoices
  const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoices.list({
    conductorEndUserId: "YOUR_END_USER_ID",
  });
  console.log(invoices.data);
}

main();
```

# Python SDK

See the [Python SDK Documentation](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-python) for more details.

```bash
pip install conductor-py
```

```python
from conductor import Conductor

conductor = Conductor(api_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY")

# Fetch the first page of invoices
invoices = conductor.qbd.invoices.list(
  conductor_end_user_id="YOUR_END_USER_ID",
)
print(invoices.data)
```


# Timeouts
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/timeouts



When you send a request to QuickBooks Desktop through Conductor, Conductor will wait up to **90 seconds** for QuickBooks Desktop to process the request and return a response.

<Note>
  If you prefer a different timeout period, you can customize it by setting the
  `Conductor-Timeout-Seconds` request header to your desired value.
</Note>

While the 90-second timeout might seem long, **it is necessary** for the following reasons:

1. **Large Data Requests:** Without paginating your requests (via the `MaxReturned` or other range-based parameters), you may unintentionally request tens of thousands of records in a single call. Processing such a large volume of data can take several minutes in QuickBooks Desktop.

2. **Sequential Processing:** QuickBooks Desktop can only process one request at a time. If multiple requests are sent concurrently, they are placed in a queue and processed sequentially, requiring sufficient time for each request to complete before the next one can begin.

3. **Potential Program Startup:** If QuickBooks Desktop is not open but the user’s computer is on, Conductor will automatically launch the program when a request is made. Given that QuickBooks Desktop can take at least 30 seconds to start, adding considerably to the response time.

<Info>
  If QuickBooks Desktop is already offline when you send the request, Conductor
  will immediately return an error **without** initiating the timeout period.

# Upgrading to Conductor's new Node.js SDK
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/upgrade-node

How to migrate from the old `conductor-node` package to Conductor's new Node.js SDK and QuickBooks Desktop API v2.

We're excited to announce a major update to `conductor-node` that brings full support for Conductor's new QuickBooks Desktop API v2. This new version introduces significant improvements in usability, consistency, and functionality.

<Info>
  Though the old version of `conductor-node` will continue to work, it will not
  receive any further updates. We strongly recommend upgrading to take advantage
  of the new features and improvements.
</Info>

## Key improvements

Our new QuickBooks Desktop API v2 has been completely redesigned from the ground up. We've carefully chosen every field name, parameter, and method description to be significantly more intuitive and clearer than QuickBooks's original documentation. The API structure has been simplified while maintaining full functionality.

Major improvements include:

* **Improved parameter and fields names**,
* Completely **rewritten inline documentation**
* **[Automatic pagination](#automatic-pagination) support**
* **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff
* **Configurable timeouts**
* New methods like **`.retrieve()`** and **`.delete()`**
* All fields included in responses
* Consistent array handling

## Warning: Some QuickBooks Desktop types are not yet available in the new SDK

<Warning>
  Several *less common* QuickBooks Desktop types/endpoints from the previous version of `conductor-node` are not *yet* available in the new SDK. **If the type is listed in the left sidebar of this page, it is supported in the new SDK.**

  Need a missing QBD type? [Contact us](mailto:support@conductor.is) and we'll add it ASAP.
</Warning>

## How to upgrade

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install conductor-node@beta
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add conductor-node@beta
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add conductor-node@beta
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Though this version of the Node.js SDK uses an NPM `@beta` tag, it ***is*
  stable and ready for production use**! We merely have a few more endpoints to
  migrate before prompting all existing users to update.
</Info>

## Breaking changes

<Note>
  **No QuickBooks or Conductor business logic has changed!** We've simply made
  the interface simpler, more intuitive, and more robust, while adding new
  features like automatic pagination and retries.
</Note>

### ⚠️ Functional Changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Missing QuickBooks Desktop types">
    Several *less common* QuickBooks Desktop types/endpoints from the previous version of `conductor-node` are not *yet* available in the new SDK. **If the type is listed in the left sidebar of this page, it is supported in the new SDK.**

    Need a missing QBD type? [Contact us](mailto:support@conductor.is) and we'll add it ASAP.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Pagination limited to 150 records per page">
    Previously, the API would return all matching records by default. This could lead to performance issues when unintentionally retrieving thousands of records, potentially causing long response times, overloading QuickBooks Desktop, and consuming excessive memory.

    To prevent these issues, **Conductor now limits responses to a maximum of 150 records per page by default**. This limit was carefully determined through extensive testing across different scenarios and system configurations to optimize performance while avoiding timeouts and resource constraints.

    With the new [automatic pagination](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-node?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-pagination), you can efficiently retrieve all records when needed, without worrying about these performance concerns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### ⚠️ Naming and Structure Changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Restructured constructor parameters">
    **Old:**

    ```typescript
    import Conductor from "conductor-node";

    const conductor = new Conductor("{{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}");
    ```

    **New:** You can now automatically load your secret key from the `CONDUCTOR_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (or pass it to the constructor as an argument like before):

    ```typescript
    import Conductor from "conductor-node";

    const conductor = new Conductor({
      apiKey: process.env["CONDUCTOR_SECRET_KEY"], // This is the default and can be omitted
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Renamed resources">
    **Old:** Singular resource names.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bill.*
    await conductor.qbd.invoice.*
    await conductor.qbd.itemInventory.*
    ```

    **New:** Plural resource names and clearer naming.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bills.*
    await conductor.qbd.invoices.*
    await conductor.qbd.inventoryItems.*
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Renamed methods">
    **Old:** Odd naming conventions.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bill.query(...)
    await conductor.qbd.bill.add(...)
    await conductor.qbd.bill.mod(...)
    ```

    **New:** Intuitive naming following REST conventions.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bills.list(...)
    await conductor.qbd.bills.create(...)
    await conductor.qbd.bills.update(...)
    await conductor.qbd.bills.retrieve(...) // New!
    await conductor.qbd.bills.delete(...) // New!
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Moved end-user ID parameter">
    **Old:** Required as its own argument.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bill.query("end_usr_1234abcd", { ... });
    ```

    **New:** Required as a `conductorEndUserId` parameter in the parameters object.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bills.list({
      conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234abcd",
      // ... other params
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Renamed request parameters">
    <Info>
      All request parameters are now in camelCase and have been renamed for clarity
      and consistency. Most of the changes are straightforward that you can find
      using autocomplete in your IDE or checking the APIs in the sidebar.
    </Info>

    **Old:** Odd naming conventions.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bill.add("end_usr_1234abcd", {
      VendorRef: { ListID: "..." },
      RefNumber: "...",
      ExpenseLineAdd: [
        {
          Amount: "1.00",
        },
      ],
    });
    ```

    **New:** camelCase and clearer naming.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bills.create({
      conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234abcd",
      vendorId: "...",
      refNumber: "...",
      expenseLines: [
        {
          amount: "1.00",
        },
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Renamed response fields">
    <Info>
      All output fields are now in camelCase and have been renamed for clarity and
      consistency. Most of the changes are straightforward that you can find using
      autocomplete in your IDE or checking the APIs in the sidebar.
    </Info>

    Here are some key renamed fields:

    * `TxnID` and `ListID` → `id`
    * `TimeCreated` and `TimeModified` → `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
    * `EditSequence` → `revisionNumber`
    * `*Ref` fields (e.g., `CustomerRef`) → simplified (e.g., `customer`)

    **Old:** Odd naming conventions.

    ```typescript
    const invoice = await conductor.qbd.invoice.query("end_usr_1234abcd", "...");
    // {
    //   TxnID: "...",
    //   TimeCreated: "...",
    //   TimeModified: "...",
    //   EditSequence: "...",
    //   TxnNumber: "...",
    //   CustomerRef: {
    //     ListID: "...",
    //     FullName: "..."
    //   }
    // }
    ```

    **New:** camelCase and clearer naming.

    ```typescript
    const invoice = await conductor.qbd.invoices.retrieve({
      conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234abcd",
      id: "...",
    });
    // {
    //   id: "...",
    //   objectType: "qbd_invoice",
    //   createdAt: "...",
    //   updatedAt: "...",
    //   revisionNumber: "...",
    //   transactionNumber: "...",
    //   customer: {
    //     id: "...",
    //     fullName: "..."
    //   }
    // }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="7. Restructured query/list request parameters">
    **Old:** Odd naming conventions and complex structure.

    ```typescript
    const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoice.query("end_usr_1234abcd", {
      ModifiedDateRangeFilter: {
        FromModifiedDate: "...",
        ToModifiedDate: "...",
      },
      AccountFilter: {
        ListID: "...",
      },
      RefNumberFilter: "...",
      RefNumberRangeFilter: {
        FromRefNumber: "...",
        ToRefNumber: "...",
      },
      MaxReturned: 100,
    });
    ```

    **New:** Significantly simplified structure and clearer naming.

    ```typescript
    const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoices.list({
      conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234abcd",
      updatedAfter: "...",
      updatedBefore: "...",
      accountId: "...",
      refNumber: "...",
      refNumberFrom: "...",
      refNumberTo: "...",
      limit: 100,
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="8. Restructured query/list responses">
    To support automatic pagination, the query/list method now returns results in an object wrapper with properties for pagination metadata.

    **Old:** Returns an array of results directly.

    ```typescript
    const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoice.query("end_usr_1234abcd");
    // [
    //   {
    //     TxnID: "...",
    //     TimeCreated: "...",
    //     ...
    //   }
    // ]
    ```

    **New:** Returns results in an object wrapper with properties for pagination metadata.

    ```typescript
    const response = await conductor.qbd.invoices.list({
      conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234abcd",
    });

    console.log(response);
    // {
    //   nextCursor: "...",
    //   hasMore: true,
    //   remainingCount: 100,
    //   data: [
    //     {
    //       id: "...",
    //       objectType: "qbd_invoice",
    //       createdAt: "...",
    //       ...
    //     }
    //   ]
    // }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="9. Consistent array responses">
    Fields that can have multiple values are now always arrays, even when there's only one record:

    ```typescript
    const response = await conductor.qbd.invoices.list({
      conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234abcd",
    });

    // All responses with potential multiple records use arrays consistently
    console.log(response.data[0].lines); // Always an array, even if there's only one line
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## New features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic pagination" icon="arrows-rotate">
    You can now easily paginate through all results. See the [automatic pagination](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-node?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-pagination) section of the README for more details.

    ```typescript
    async function fetchAllQbdInvoices(params) {
      const allQbdInvoices = [];
      // Automatically fetches more pages as needed
      for await (const invoice of conductor.qbd.invoices.list({
        conductorEndUserId: "{{YOUR_END_USER_ID}}",
        ...params,
      })) {
        allQbdInvoices.push(invoice);
      }
      return allQbdInvoices;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic retries with exponential backoff" icon="arrow-rotate-right">
    Intelligently retries requests, but only those requests that can potentially succeed when retried (such as network errors).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New retrieve and delete methods" icon="code">
    All objects now have a `retrieve` method and all transaction objects have a `delete` method.

    ```typescript
    await conductor.qbd.bills.retrieve({ conductorEndUserId: "...", id: "..." });
    await conductor.qbd.bills.delete({ conductorEndUserId: "...", id: "..." });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complete field returns" icon="database">
    The new API now returns a consistent response structure with all possible fields, making it easier to work with the data. Fields that have no value are explicitly set to `null` rather than being omitted, and empty array fields return `[]` instead of being excluded. This means you can reliably access any field without checking if it exists first, and array operations will work consistently without special handling for missing fields.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# What's new in API v2
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/api-ref/whats-new

Conductor's new QuickBooks Desktop API is a massive leap forward and sets the foundation for future integrations.

Welcome to Conductor's new QuickBooks Desktop API v2.

**API v2 brings the following improvements over v1.0:**

1. Proper HTTP methods: `GET` for reading, `POST` for creating or updating. No more `POST` for everything.
2. Cleaner URL endpoints: `/quickbooks_desktop/invoices` instead of `/end-users/{id}/passthrough/quickbooks_desktop` with `InvoiceQueryRq` in the body.
3. An OpenAPI spec for the entire API.
4. Full online documentation of all fields and their types.
5. API playground in the documentation to test requests and see responses.
6. Always returns all response fields. Uses `null` for undefined fields instead of omitting them.
7. Consistently returns arrays for any nested fields that previously returned a single object for one item and an array for multiple items.
   * Returns an empty array instead of `null` for empty lists.
8. Clean response bodies: No more unwrapping outer objects; e.g., no more `InvoiceQueryRs.InvoiceRet`.
9. Proper object wrapper for all list responses: Previously, we returned an array of objects. Now, we return an object with a `data` field that contains the array of objects.
10. Pagination for all list endpoints.
11. Better parameter names instead of QuickBooks Desktop's unconventional naming. For example:
    * `MaxReturned` → `limit`
    * `TimeModified` → `updatedAt`
    * `DataExtRet` → `customFields`
12. Uses `camelCase` for input and output field names instead of `PascalCase`.
13. Simplified request structure. For example:
    * `refNumberStartsWith: "REF"` instead of `RefNumberFilter: { MatchCriterion: "StartsWith", RefNumber: "REF" }`
    * `accountId: "123"` instead of `AccountRef: { ListID: "123" }`
14. Correct types for obscure fields: Previously, we inferred types from XML. Now, we define the type of every field to ensure it is always correct.
15. Better field descriptions: we are using our own descriptions instead of QuickBooks' descriptions.
16. Field-specific coercions: better handling of dates and money amounts.
17. Enforced upper bound on `limit` of 150 records per page to prevent unintentionally overloading QuickBooks Desktop instances.
18. Better defaults. For example:
    * `includeLineItems` is `true` by default because who wants an empty invoice?
    * `ownerId` is 0 by default to always include your end-users' custom fields.

## Feedback

We value your input! If you have suggestions or requests for improvements, changes, field names, documentation, or anything else, [please let us know](mailto:support@conductor.is?subject=Conductor%20QuickBooks%20Desktop%20API%20Feedback).

# FAQ

The fundamentals of Conductor.

## Conductor basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Conductor work?">
    Conductor is a web service that securely connects your app to one or more QuickBooks Desktop instances. It provides a RESTful API and fully-typed client libraries that you can use to read and write data to/from QuickBooks Desktop.

    Behind the scenes, Conductor uses the QuickBooks Web Connector, which is a Windows SOAP-based program that comes preinstalled with QuickBooks Desktop on your end-users' computers. This program always runs invisibly in the background, waiting for requests from Conductor. When you send a request to Conductor, it forwards the request to the Web Connector, which then forwards the request to QuickBooks Desktop. The response follows the same path in reverse. Between each of those steps, there are many layers of error handling, validation, and data transformation.

    Conductor abstracts away multiple layers of complexity, idiosyncrasies, and fragility of working with QuickBooks Desktop so that interfacing with this tragically outdated technology is as easy and wonderful as using Stripe's API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do users set up the QuickBooks Desktop integration with Conductor?">
    Conductor leverages a program called QuickBooks Web Connector, which comes preinstalled with all versions of QuickBooks Desktop and runs invisibly in the background on the Windows computer to maintain the connection. To connect, the QuickBooks Desktop users will step through Conductor's [authentication flow](/usage/auth-flow), which has them download a config file that Conductor generates, open it in the Web Connector, authenticate, and connect to Conductor (and thereby to your application). Here is a [demo of the auth flow](https://connect.conductor.is/qbd/demo).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pricing: How much does Conductor cost?">
    Conductor is priced at **\$49 per month for each active QuickBooks Desktop company file connection**. A connection is considered active if *both* of the following conditions are met within the same monthly billing period:

    1. Conductor receives a heartbeat from the QuickBooks Desktop instance.
    2. Your application makes a Conductor API call to that connection.

    NOTE: Connections used for testing and development are free. Connections using data from an active production environment are not.

    Volume discounts are available for enterprises requiring a large number of connections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use Conductor or build the integration from scratch?">
    Integrating with QuickBooks Desktop from scratch is a painful nightmare. It's a decades-old API that hasn't been modernized and is riddled with edge cases, idiosyncrasies, and bugs that are incredibly difficult to work with. Conductor solves all of these problems and takes only a fraction of the time to implement with none of the maintenance headaches. We have obsessed over the edge cases and performance. Beyond the significant time savings, **Conductor preserves your team's mental well-being**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data handling and security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Conductor use a cache layer between me and my end-users' QuickBooks Desktop?">
    No, every Conductor API call is a real-time direct request to/from QuickBooks Desktop. If you make a request when the end-user's computer is off or QuickBooks Desktop is inaccessible, Conductor will return an error message with instructions for how the end-user can resolve the issue.

    By design, Conductor has no cache layer because it causes all sorts of problems when data is out-of-sync. E.g., you modify data on one end that has already been removed on the other.

    Ideally, the computer running QuickBooks Desktop is always on and accessible. If that is not possible for some end-users, this design has still worked well because if such an end-user triggers a sync while using your app, they likely did so from the same computer as where QuickBooks Desktop is already running.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Conductor store any of my end-users' QuickBooks Desktop data?">
    No, Conductor does not retain any of your end-users' QuickBooks Desktop data on a permanent basis. For operational purposes, API request logs, which includes QuickBooks Desktop data, are temporarily, securely stored in a SOC 2 and GDPR-compliant log manager for 14 days before permanent deletion. Access to these logs is strictly limited to authorized Conductor engineers, who use them solely for debugging, offering customer support, and product improvement purposes. This approach ensures both the confidentiality of your data and compliance with the highest standards of data protection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Conductor support batch processing?">
    No, Conductor's APIs currently only support working with a single object at a time because QuickBooks Desktop itself only resolves requests serially. If you want to create 50 invoices, for example, you will need to call the create-invoice API 50 times. However, you can send multiple requests in parallel; for example, you can use `await Promise.all([ ... ])` in JavaScript with multiple requests, but you cannot send multiple requests in a single HTTPS request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## QuickBooks Desktop and Web Connector

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the QuickBooks Web Connector?">
    The QuickBooks Web Connector is a Windows program that comes preinstalled with QuickBooks Desktop that Conductor uses to securely communicate with QuickBooks Desktop. This program runs invisibly in the background on the end-user's computer, waiting for requests from Conductor. The only time your end-user should see the Web Connector is when they first set up their QuickBooks Desktop connection with Conductor; other than that, it should be invisible to them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a QuickBooks Desktop &#x22;company file&#x22;?">
    In the world of QuickBooks Desktop, a "company file" is the main local file for all the financial data for a specific company. Typically, a QuickBooks Desktop user will have only one company file: the one they use to manage their business. However, some users manage multiple company files on one computer and actively switch between them. For example, an accounting firm might manage the books for multiple clients, each with their own QuickBooks Desktop company file.

    Each Conductor connection is tied to a specific company file. If you need to connect to multiple company files, you will need to create multiple end-users in Conductor, each with their own connection. See this [guide](/help/guides/multiple-connections-one-computer) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What versions of QuickBooks Desktop does Conductor support?">
    Conductor supports every version, variant, and edition of QuickBooks Desktop since 2018, including:

    * **QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions - any version or year**
      * Any edition: Accountant, Contractor, Manufacturing and Wholesale, Nonprofit, Professional Services, Retail.
    * **QuickBooks Premier (Plus) - 2018 or later**
      * Any edition: Accountant, Contractor, Manufacturing and Wholesale, Nonprofit, Professional Services, Retail.
    * **QuickBooks Desktop Pro (Plus) - 2018 or later**
    * **QuickBooks Accountant Desktop (Plus) - 2018 or later**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is QuickBooks Desktop being discontinued?">
    No, QuickBooks Desktop is not being discontinued.

    1. **Ongoing Support:** Intuit continues to support all existing versions of QuickBooks Desktop for current customers.
    2. **Continued Sales:** Intuit is still actively selling "QuickBooks Enterprise", the main version of QuickBooks Desktop tailored for medium to large businesses, to new customers.
    3. **Product Changes:** Intuit will soon cease sales of "QuickBooks Desktop Pro/Premier Plus" – a less popular variant primarily used by small family businesses – to *new* customers (existing customers will still be supported).

    While Intuit has encouraged users to migrate to QuickBooks Online, Desktop users consistently tell us that it doesn't fully meet their business needs. Consequently, the base of existing QuickBooks Desktop users, including both "Enterprise" and "Pro/Premier" versions, remains robust. Conductor continues to support these users and their ongoing reliance on QuickBooks Desktop.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Compatibility and connectivity

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Conductor support multiple Web Connector connections across different computers to the same QuickBooks Desktop company file?">
    Yes, you can set up Web Connector connections on multiple computers for the same QuickBooks Desktop company file. This is applicable if your company shares the same company file across multiple computers on your office network. This setup can serve as a backup in case one computer is offline. However, we haven't seen any Conductor users needing this approach so far, but we have confirmed that it works.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Conductor access QuickBooks Desktop instances when the user's computer is off?">
    No, there is no way to access QuickBooks Desktop instances when the user's computer is off because QuickBooks Desktop data is not stored online. Instead, QuickBooks Desktop is a local application that runs on a user's computer. As a result, this means an active Conductor connection is always direct and real-time. Conductor intentionally avoids using a cache layer to prevent potential data conflicts when data is out-of-sync.

    While this may seem limiting to many developers, we find that typical QuickBooks Desktop users do not mind:

    1. **User Availability:** When a user is interacting with your application that syncs data with QuickBooks Desktop, they are typically at their computer anyway, which means that QuickBooks Desktop is accessible.

    2. **User Control:** Many QuickBooks Desktop users are protective of their data and prefer to manually initiate data syncs rather than rely on automatic background processes. This approach gives them greater control over their data and ensures that no syncs occur without their explicit consent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does QuickBooks Desktop need to be open for Conductor to connect?">
    No, QuickBooks Desktop does not need to be actively open. As long as the computer itself is powered on, Conductor can send a request to QuickBooks Desktop, which will then automatically launch in the background, process the request, and close itself once completed.

    **Important Note:** Launching QuickBooks Desktop in the background adds approximately 30 seconds to the request processing time due to the software's startup process. For optimal response times, we recommend keeping QuickBooks Desktop open while using Conductor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Conductor support connections to multiple QuickBooks Desktop company files on the same computer?">
    Yes, please see this [guide](/help/guides/multiple-connections-one-computer) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What QuickBooks Desktop hosting providers does Conductor support?">
    A QuickBooks Desktop hosting provider is a company that hosts an end-user's QuickBooks Desktop instance and company file on a remote server that employees access via a remote desktop connection.

    <Tip>
      Conductor works with any system that has QuickBooks Web Connector installed, which comes pre-installed with QuickBooks Desktop itself. For this reason, **Conductor can support every QuickBooks Desktop hosting provider we have encountered to date**.
    </Tip>

    <Info>
      Some hosting providers, such as Rightworks, do not allow QuickBooks to continue running when users disconnect from their remote desktop session. In these scenarios, the user must remain connected to the remote desktop anytime they want to sync with QuickBooks (via Conductor). However, we've found that this is not a burden for most users because connecting to their remote desktop to work with QuickBooks data is already part of their daily workflow.
    </Info>

    #### Verified hosting providers

    We have individually verified Conductor compatibility with the following QuickBooks Desktop hosting providers:

    * [Cloud9](https://cloud9realtime.com)
    * [CloudAspects](https://cloudaspects.com)
    * [CloudTop Office](https://cloudtopoffice.com)
    * [Eezycloud](https://eezycloud.com)
    * [Gotomyerp](https://gotomyerp.com)
    * [InSynQ](https://insynq.com)
    * [IV Desk](https://ivdesk.com)
    * [MyRealData](https://myrealdata.com)
    * [Personable](https://personable.com)
    * [Prosource](https://getprosource.com)
    * [QuickBooks Enterprise with cloud access](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/enterprise/hosting)
    * [Rightworks (formerly Right Networks)](https://rightworks.com) - [special setup required](/help/guides/rightworks)
    * [Skyline Cloud Services by Unidata](https://skylinecloudservices.com)
    * [Summit Hosting](https://summithosting.com)
    * [SwizzNet/Visory](https://visory.net/application-hosting/quickbooks)
    * [Trapp Technology](https://trapptechnology.com/quickbooks-cloud)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Conductor support Rightworks (previously called Right Networks)?">
    Yes, Conductor is fully compatible with Rightworks. Users can establish the connection just as they would with a typical Windows instance running QuickBooks Desktop.

    However, there is an important consideration: Rightworks users must sign in to their remote desktop session each time they wish to sync with QuickBooks Desktop. This requirement exists because Rightworks terminates inactive instances once the connection is closed, preventing background processes from running when the user is signed out. Despite this, most users find this process manageable because signing in to Rightworks is a routine part of their workflow. It is worth noting that, based on our experience, remote QuickBooks Desktop hosts like Rightworks account for fewer than 2% of all QuickBooks Desktop companies.

    Please see [this guide](/help/guides/rightworks) for setting up a Conductor connection with a Rightworks QuickBooks Desktop instance.

{/* NOTE: The following solution is identical to `there-was-a-problem-with-the-log-file.mdx` */}

## Solution

To prevent Windows from showing you the prompt above, which blocks Conductor from syncing QuickBooks Desktop, you must configure QuickBooks Desktop and the QuickBooks Web Connector to run as an administrator. To do so, follow the steps below:

### 1. Run QuickBooks Desktop as an administrator

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the QuickBooks Desktop shortcut">
    Using Windows search (usually located in the bottom-left corner of your
    screen), type "**QuickBooks Desktop**", right-click on the QuickBooks
    Desktop result, and select "**Open file location**". If you have QuickBooks
    Desktop pinned to your taskbar or on your desktop, you can right-click on
    the icon there instead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access properties">
    In the folder that opens, right-click on the QuickBooks Desktop icon and
    select "**Properties**" to open the Properties window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the Compatibility tab">
    In the Properties window, navigate to the "**Compatibility**" tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set to run as administrator">
    Check the box labeled "**Run this program as an administrator**" under the
    Settings section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply and OK">
    Click "**Apply**" to save the changes, then click "**OK**" to close the
    Properties window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart QuickBooks Desktop">
    If QuickBooks Desktop is currently open, close it completely and then
    re-open it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Run the QuickBooks Web Connector as an administrator

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Web Connector shortcut">
    Using Windows search (usually located in the bottom-left corner of your
    screen), type "**Web Connector**", right-click on the Web Connector result,
    and select "**Open file location**".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access properties">
    In the folder that opens, right-click on the Web Connector icon and select
    "**Properties**" to open the Properties window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the Compatibility tab">
    In the Properties window, navigate to the "**Compatibility**" tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set to run as administrator">
    Check the box labeled "**Run this program as an administrator**" under the
    Settings section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply and OK">
    Click "**Apply**" to save the changes, then click "**OK**" to close the
    Properties window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart your computer">
    Restart your computer to ensure the changes take effect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, QuickBooks Desktop and the Web Connector will always run with administrator privileges, preventing the error from occurring.

  <Step title="Sign in using the QuickBooks built-in &#x22;Admin&#x22; user account">
    Sign in using the QuickBooks built-in "Admin" user. **The username must be exactly "Admin"** - not any other user, even if it has administrative privileges.

    <Info>
      Signing in as the "Admin" user is only needed for this one-time setup process. After setup is complete, you can return to using your regular QuickBooks Desktop user account.
    </Info>

    <Image src="/images/help/connection-errors/qbd-admin-required/sign-in-as-admin.jpg" alt="QuickBooks Desktop sign in as Admin" width="450" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-open the QuickBooks config file">
    Re-open the QuickBooks config file again from your Downloads folder (it has the file extension `.qwc`). This is the file you just downloaded from the QuickBooks Desktop setup guide. Now, QuickBooks Desktop should no longer show the error shown above and you can continue setting up the connection.

# QuickBooks Desktop FAQ for end-users
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/help/faq/end-user-faq

An FAQ guide written for the end-users of Conductor's QuickBooks Desktop integration.

<Info>
  This guide is provided by Conductor, the service that powers the QuickBooks
  Desktop integration for many business tools, including the one that sent you
  here.
</Info>

This FAQ is designed to answer any questions you may have about your QuickBooks Desktop connection and Conductor, the technology provider that powers it.

### How does the integration connect with QuickBooks Desktop?

The integration uses the QuickBooks Web Connector, an built-in feature of QuickBooks Desktop designed for secure data synchronization. This method is officially recommended by QuickBooks and involves robust user authentication and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. This ensures that your data is encrypted during transmission, protecting it from unauthorized access.

### Do you store any of my QuickBooks Desktop data?

**No, we do not store any of your QuickBooks Desktop data.** The integration acts as a secure conduit, facilitating the transfer of information between your QuickBooks Desktop and the software you are using, without retaining any of that information on our systems.

### What is the QuickBooks Desktop Web Connector?

The QuickBooks Web Connector is a program that comes preinstalled with QuickBooks Desktop that the integration uses to securely sync your data. This program always runs invisibly in the background on your computer and starts automatically whenever you start your computer. If it does not start automatically, the integration cannot reliably sync your data. The only time you should ever see the Web Connector is when you first set up your QuickBooks Desktop connection with the integration; other than that, it should be invisible.

### What security measures does the integration implement to secure data?

Our QuickBooks Desktop integration adheres to the industry's top security practices, including:

* **SSL Encryption:** For secure data transmission.
* **Encrypted API Keys:** Unique keys that ensure only authorized software can access your data.
* **Zero Data Storage Policy:** We don't store your QuickBooks data, maintaining your privacy.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Our systems are monitored continuously for any unusual activity to prevent unauthorized access.

### Does the integration impact the speed or performance of QuickBooks Desktop?

No, the integration does not slow down QuickBooks Desktop. Here's why:

* The integration is powered by QuickBooks Desktop's built-in Web Connector. When the Web Connector is running in the background, it operates independently of QuickBooks Desktop, much like any other Windows program. In this idle state, it simply waits for new requests without interacting with QuickBooks Desktop.
* Even when processing a request, QuickBooks Desktop's performance would only be impacted if more than 5,000 records were being retrieved at once, however, we prevent this by limiting requests to 500 records at a time.
* The Web Connector is lightweight and only checks for new requests every 10 seconds, making it unlikely to slow down the Windows system as a whole.
* We have never observed or received reports of the integration affecting system performance.

### Which data from QuickBooks Desktop can the integration access?

The integration can read and write most data types in your QuickBooks Desktop, ***excluding* sensitive personal information like Social Security Numbers and customer credit card details**. This broad access is necessary because the QuickBooks Web Connector does not support limited permissions for selective data access.

### Does my computer need to be powered on to sync my QuickBooks Desktop data?

Yes, your computer must be powered on to sync your QuickBooks Desktop data.

### Can I connect to multiple QuickBooks Desktop company files on the same computer?

Yes, you can connect to multiple company files on a single computer, but it requires maintaining a specific setup to work correctly. Please see our [guide on connecting multiple company files](/help/guides/multiple-connections-one-computer) for critical setup instructions and best practices.

### Does QuickBooks Desktop need to be open to sync my data?

No, QuickBooks Desktop does not need to be open for syncing. The Web Connector will automatically open QuickBooks when needed and close it after completing the sync. However, there are three scenarios to consider:

1. **QuickBooks open with your company file loaded:** This provides the fastest sync experience and is recommended when possible.
2. **QuickBooks open but no company file loaded:** If you want to conserve active QuickBooks license seats, you can keep QuickBooks at the "No Company Open" screen. The Web Connector will automatically open your company file when syncing. This is slower than option 1 but faster than option 3.
3. **QuickBooks completely closed:** The Web Connector will launch QuickBooks automatically, but this significantly slows down the sync process due to application startup time.

Note that if QuickBooks is open with a different company file than the one you're trying to sync, the operation will return an error.

### Does my computer need to sign in as the Admin user to sync my data?

No, signing in as the Admin user is only required for the initial setup process. After the setup is complete, you can switch back to your regular QuickBooks Desktop user.

### Is it a problem if the Web Connector says "Update postponed by application"?

No, there is no problem at all if you see this message. It means that things are working correctly. This message indicates that the Web Connector has checked for updates, but no sync is necessary at the moment.

### How often does the integration access my QuickBooks data?

The frequency of data access is determined by the software you are using. Typically, data syncs occur when you initiate them (e.g., clicking a "sync" button in your software). For specifics, please contact your software provider.

### Does the integration support Rightworks (formerly called Right Networks)?

Yes, the integration fully supports QuickBooks Desktop when hosted on Rightworks. For setup instructions, please see our [Connecting to Rightworks guide](/help/guides/rightworks).

### How can I disable the QuickBooks Desktop connection?

Please follow [this guide](/help/guides/disable-connection) to disable the QuickBooks Desktop connection.

### Who is Conductor?

Conductor is a technology provider that powers the QuickBooks Desktop integration for the software you're using. We specialize in creating secure, reliable connections between different software platforms, ensuring your data flows smoothly and safely from QuickBooks Desktop to your business application.

### Any other questions?

If you have any other questions, please check the other guides in the sidebar on the left, contact your software provider, or email us at [support@conductor.is](mailto:support@conductor.is).

The QuickBooks Web Connector is a program that comes preinstalled with QuickBooks Desktop that Conductor uses to securely sync your data. This program always runs invisibly in the background on your computer and starts automatically whenever you start your computer. If it does not start automatically, Conductor cannot reliably sync your data.

If you are having trouble syncing your data, please follow the steps below to ensure that the Web Connector starts automatically when you start your computer. If we discover it does not, we will configure the Windows Task Scheduler to start the Web Connector automatically.

## 1. Check if the Web Connector starts automatically when you start your computer

First, let's check whether the Web Connector starts automatically when you start your computer:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Restart your computer">
    Restart your computer so we can check in the next step whether the Web Connector automatically starts when your computer starts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the Task Manager for the Web Connector">
    After your computer finishes booting up, the Web Connector should automatically start invisibly in the background. Let's check if it is running:

    1. Open the Windows Task Manager by searching for "Task Manager" in the Windows search bar (usually located in the bottom-left corner of your screen).

    2. If you see a "More details" button in the bottom-left corner of the Task Manager window, click it to expand the Task Manager.

    3. Navigate to the "Details" tab and scroll down until you see the "QBWebConnector.exe" process which should look like the screenshot below. **If you see it, you can skip the rest of this guide. Otherwise, continue to the section below.**

# Connect to multiple QuickBooks company files on a single computer
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/help/guides/multiple-connections-one-computer

How to connect to multiple QuickBooks Desktop company files on a single computer.

<Info>
  This guide is provided by Conductor, the service that powers the QuickBooks
  Desktop integration for many business tools, including the one that sent you
  here.
</Info>

In QuickBooks Desktop, a **company file** is the primary local file that stores all financial data for a specific company. While most QuickBooks Desktop users have only one company file, some users, such as accounting firms managing finances for multiple clients, work with several company files on a single computer. This guide will walk you through connecting Conductor (which powers your integration) to multiple company files on a single computer, as well as best practices and performance considerations.

## Important requirement

Companies managing multiple company files typically host them all on a dedicated Windows server. **You will want to set up the Conductor connections on this Windows server**, adhering to the following requirement:

<Warning>
  **QuickBooks Desktop must always remain open *without* any company file loaded
  when connecting to multiple company files on a single computer.** This setup
  allows the Web Connector to open the correct company file when it receives a
  request from your QuickBooks Desktop integration.
</Warning>

### Why is this necessary?

The [QuickBooks Web Connector](/help/faq/end-user-faq#what-is-the-quickbooks-desktop-web-connector) has certain limitations when working with multiple company files on a single computer:

1. It can only communicate with one company file at a time.
2. It can only communicate with the company file that is currently open in QuickBooks Desktop.
3. It cannot switch between company files if QuickBooks Desktop already has a different company file open (to avoid disrupting an active user).

Despite these limitations, **the Web Connector can open a specified company file if no other company file is currently open, fulfill the request, and then close the company file** without fully closing QuickBooks Desktop. Therefore, keeping QuickBooks Desktop open without any company file loaded allows the Web Connector to open and process requests for the correct company file as needed.

### How to close a company file

To ensure QuickBooks Desktop is open without any company file loaded:

1. Open **QuickBooks Desktop**.
2. Go to the "**File**" menu.
3. Select "**Close Company**".

<Frame caption="QuickBooks Desktop must always be open without any company file loaded, as shown here, to receive requests for any company file on the computer.">
  ![QuickBooks Desktop without any company file
  loaded](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/conductor/images/help/guides/multiple-connections-one-computer/qbd-no-company-open.jpg)
</Frame>

If you or someone else opens a company file *on this machine* without returning QuickBooks Desktop to this state, you may encounter an error stating that the wrong company file is open.

## How to set up connections to multiple company files

To connect to multiple company files on one computer, you must complete the setup process **for each company file**, as each requires its own connection and authentication.

1. Open **QuickBooks Desktop**.
2. Open the company file you wish to connect.
3. Sign in as the **Admin** user.
4. Complete the setup guide *while* the corresponding company file is open.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each company file.

Once complete, each company file will have a separate connection in the Web Connector, resembling the state shown below:

<Frame caption="An example of the QuickBooks Web Connector with multiple connections for separate company files.">
  ![QuickBooks Web Connector with multiple
  connections](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/conductor/images/help/guides/multiple-connections-one-computer/web-connector-multiple-connections.jpg)
</Frame>

## Best practices

* **Use a dedicated Windows server:** Most users managing multiple company files already have a Windows server dedicated to managing their QuickBooks Desktop company files. Set up the Conductor Web Connector connection on this server. On this server, keep QuickBooks Desktop open without a company file loaded so that it is ready to receive requests and open the correct company file. This setup is preferable to sharing a personal computer used for other tasks, where the Web Connector cannot fulfill requests if the wrong company file is open.

* **Add QuickBooks Desktop to Windows startup:** Adding QuickBooks Desktop to the computer's startup programs ensures it is always open and ready to receive requests whenever you restart the computer. The Web Connector already automatically starts in the background when the computer boots up and can open QuickBooks Desktop if it receives a request from Conductor while QuickBooks Desktop is closed; however, doing so will delay the request because QuickBooks Desktop takes a while to launch.

## Performance considerations

* **Increased request time:** Keeping QuickBooks Desktop open without a company file loaded adds 20-40 seconds to each request due to the time it takes to load a company file. However, when you send numerous Conductor requests for the same company file in quick succession, the Web Connector will resolve the sequence rapidly because Conductor keeps the company file open between these requests.

* **Serial processing:** The Web Connector can only process requests for one company file at a time because it can only communicate with QuickBooks Desktop when one company file is loaded. Therefore, Conductor manages your requests in a queue, ensuring that the Web Connector processes them serially, opening and closing the appropriate company file for each request.

An **invoice** in QuickBooks Desktop records the amount owed by a customer who purchased goods or services but did not pay in full at the time of the sale. If full payment is received at the time of the sale, it is recorded as a [sales receipt](/api-ref/qbd/sales-receipts), not an invoice.

## Fetching invoices

Each invoice in QuickBooks Desktop has several line items, which you would typically want to include when fetching invoices. The following example does just that:

```ts Fetching all invoices with line items
const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoice.query("{{END_USER_ID}}", {
  IncludeLineItems: true,
});
```

Invoices are also assigned to specific jobs under a customer or to the customer directly when not related to a particular job. The following example fetches all invoices for a specific customer:

```ts Fetching all invoices for a specific customer
const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoice.query("{{END_USER_ID}}", {
  EntityFilter: {
    FullName: "Test customer 1234",
  },
  IncludeLineItems: true,
});
```

Here is an example of fetching invoices modified (or created) after a specific date:

```ts Fetching invoices modified after a specific date
const invoices = await conductor.qbd.invoice.query("{{END_USER_ID}}", {
  ModifiedDateRangeFilter: {
    FromModifiedDate: "2024-04-01",
  },
  IncludeLineItems: true,
});
```

## Creating invoices

An invoice is a complex object with many associated objects. To create an invoice from scratch, you either need the identifiers (e.g., `ListID`) of the required associated objects, or you must create the associated objects first.

The following example uses mock data to create an invoice in QuickBooks Desktop, which also requires creating a mock customer, account, and service-item using the `add()` method of each object. The `add()` method returns the created object, which contains the `ListID` identifier to associate the objects with each other.

```ts Creating an invoice
const END_USER_ID = "{{END_USER_ID}}";
// Use unique names for mock objects because QBD requires each to be unique.
const UNIQUE_SUFFIX = Math.random().toFixed(6);

const customer = await conductor.qbd.customer.add(END_USER_ID, {
  Name: `Test customer ${UNIQUE_SUFFIX}`,
});

// An invoice cannot be empty, so we must create an item to add to the invoice,
// and every item requires an account, which we must create first.
const account = await conductor.qbd.account.add(END_USER_ID, {
  Name: `Test income account ${UNIQUE_SUFFIX}`,
  AccountType: "Income",
});

// Create a service-item for the invoice with the account we just created.
const serviceItem = await conductor.qbd.itemService.add(END_USER_ID, {
  Name: `Construction work ${UNIQUE_SUFFIX}`,
  SalesOrPurchase: {
    Price: "100.00",
    AccountRef: {
      ListID: account.ListID,
    },
  },
});

const invoice = await conductor.qbd.invoice.add(END_USER_ID, {
  CustomerRef: {
    ListID: customer.ListID,
  },
  TxnDate: "2021-09-01",
  InvoiceLineAdd: [
    {
      Amount: "100.00",
      ItemRef: {
        ListID: serviceItem.ListID,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Updating invoices and line-items

To modify existing line-items or add line-items to an invoice, QuickBooks Desktop requires that you include all unmodified line-items in the update request, even the ones you do not want to change. Otherwise, QuickBooks Desktop will remove the line-items you did not include in the update request. Hence, we recommend you first query the invoice you want to update, then update that invoice with the new line-items you want to add or modify while including all the existing line-items returned from the query.

```ts Updating an invoice by adding a new line-item
const END_USER_ID = "{{END_USER_ID}}";

const newInvoice = await conductor.qbd.invoice.add(END_USER_ID, {
  CustomerRef: {
    FullName: "Test Customer",
  },
  Memo: "New invoice",
  InvoiceLineAdd: [
    {
      ItemRef: {
        FullName: "Test Item",
      },
      Desc: "First line item",
      Amount: "100.00",
    },
    {
      ItemRef: {
        FullName: "Test Item",
      },
      Desc: "Second line item",
      Amount: "200.00",
    },
  ],
});

const updatedInvoice = await conductor.qbd.invoice.mod(END_USER_ID, {
  TxnID: newInvoice.TxnID,
  // `EditSequence` from the original object is required to update
  // any QuickBooks Desktop object.
  EditSequence: newInvoice.EditSequence,
  Memo: "Updated invoice",
  InvoiceLineMod: [
    // QuickBooks Desktop requires that you re-include the
    // existing line items in the request. Otherwise, it will
    // remove them from the invoice.
    ...newInvoice.InvoiceLineRet,
    {
      ItemRef: {
        ListID: inventoryItems[0].ListID,
      },
      Desc: "Item 3",
      // Set `TxnLineID` to -1 to add a new line item.
      TxnLineID: "-1",
    },
  ],
});
```

# Jobs and customers
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/qbd-examples/jobs-and-customers

Understanding the relationship between customers and jobs in QuickBooks Desktop.

export const pluralObjectName_0 = "customers"

## Overview

In QuickBooks Desktop, both "customers" and "jobs" are represented as `Customer` objects. Jobs are considered a subset of customers and cannot be queried separately. This data model is a quirk of QuickBooks Desktop and is outside of Conductor's control.

## Differences between jobs and customers

A job in QuickBooks Desktop differs from a customer in the following ways:

1. **ParentRef**: A job has a `ParentRef` property that points to the parent customer.

2. **FullName**: A job's `FullName` property is the concatenation of the parent customer's `FullName` and the job's Name.

   * Example: If the parent customer's `FullName` is `"Annie's Alligators"` and the job's Name is `"Swamp"`, the job's `FullName` will be `"Annie's Alligators:Swamp"`.

3. **Sublevel**: A job has a `Sublevel` property set to `1`, while the parent customer's `Sublevel` property is set to `0`.

## Querying customers and jobs

To fetch all customers and jobs for a given end-user, use the following query:

```ts Fetching all customers and jobs
const customersAndJobs = await conductor.qbd.customer.query("{{END_USER_ID}}");
```

<Tip>
  If you're looking for a specific job in QuickBooks Desktop, you must query for
  the customer and then filter the results to find the job.
</Tip>

<Info>
  To see all of the **request parameters and response fields** for
  {pluralObjectName_0}, check out our client library's [amazing
  autocomplete](/usage/autocomplete).
</Info>

## Fetching objects related to customers' jobs

Some objects in QuickBooks Desktop, such as SalesOrders, are associated with a customer's job instead of directly with the customer. In these cases, querying using the `EntityFilter.ListID` parameter set to a customer's `ListID` will return no results.

To fetch objects related to a customer's jobs, use the `EntityFilter.ListIDWithChildren` parameter with the customer's `ListID`. This will return the objects corresponding to all of the customer's jobs. For example:

```ts Fetching SalesOrders for all jobs of a customer
const salesOrders = await conductor.qbd.salesOrder.query("{{END_USER_ID}}", {
  EntityFilter: {
    // The `ListID` of the customer whose jobs' SalesOrders you want to fetch.
    ListIDWithChildren: "800000AB-1234567890",
  },
});
```

By using the `ListIDWithChildren` parameter, you can effectively query for objects related to a customer's jobs without having to query for each job individually.


# Refunds
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/qbd-examples/refunds



This guide covers how to implement refunds using Conductor's QuickBooks Desktop API. We'll cover two main scenarios:

1. Invoice-based refunds (full or partial)
2. Custom refunds (not linked to any invoice)

## Invoice-based refund

For invoice-based refunds, you will create a credit memo and then apply it to the relevant invoice using a receive payment transaction to reduce the outstanding balance.

### Step 1: Create the credit memo

First, create a credit memo for the customer for the amount you wish to refund. This credit memo can be for the full or partial amount of the invoice.

Here's an example of how to create a credit memo:

```typescript
const creditMemo = await conductor.qbd.creditMemo.add("{{END_USER_ID}}", {
  CustomerRef: {
    ListID: "customer_list_id", // Customer's ListID from the original invoice
  },
  TxnDate: "2024-10-23", // Current date
  RefNumber: "REFUND-123", // Optional: Your reference number
  Memo: "Refund for Invoice INV-001", // Add a memo for reference
  CreditMemoLineAdd: [
    {
      ItemRef: {
        ListID: "item_list_id", // Original item from the invoice
      },
      Desc: "Refund for Invoice #123",
      Quantity: 1, // Quantity being refunded
      Amount: "50.00", // Amount being refunded for the item
    },
  ],
});
```

### Step 2: Apply the credit memo to the invoice

Next, apply the credit memo to the outstanding invoice using a receive payment request. This will reduce the balance of the invoice by the credit amount.

Here's an example of how to apply the credit:

```typescript
const receivePayment = await conductor.qbd.receivePayment.add(
  "{{END_USER_ID}}",
  {
    CustomerRef: {
      ListID: "customer_list_id", // Must match the customer from credit memo
    },
    TotalAmount: "0.00", // No new payment being received
    Memo: "Applying credit memo to invoice",
    AppliedToTxnAdd: {
      TxnID: "original_invoice_txn_id", // Original invoice's TxnID
      PaymentAmount: "0.00", // No payment being made
      SetCredit: {
        CreditTxnID: creditMemo.TxnID, // TxnID from the credit memo we just created
        AppliedAmount: "50.00", // Amount of credit to apply
      },
    },
  },
);
```

## Custom refund (not linked to any invoice)

For a custom refund not linked to any specific invoice, simply create a credit memo to record the amount owed to the customer.

Here's an example of how to create a custom credit memo:

```typescript
const standaloneCreditMemo = await conductor.qbd.creditMemo.add(
  "{{END_USER_ID}}",
  {
    CustomerRef: {
      ListID: "customer_list_id", // Required: Customer's ListID
    },
    TxnDate: "2024-10-23", // Current date
    RefNumber: "REFUND-124", // Optional: Your reference number
    Memo: "Goodwill refund",
    CreditMemoLineAdd: [
      {
        ItemRef: {
          ListID: "refund_item_list_id", // Use a specific item for refunds
        },
        Desc: "Customer satisfaction refund",
        Amount: "75.00", // Refund amount
      },
    ],
  },
);
```

## Common scenarios

### Partial refund

Modify the `CreditMemoLineAdd.Amount` to match the partial refund amount:

```typescript
CreditMemoLineAdd: [
  {
    ItemRef: { ListID: "item_list_id" },
    Desc: "Partial refund - 50%",
    Amount: "25.00", // Half of the original amount
  },
];
```

### Multiple item refund

Use multiple `CreditMemoLineAdd` entries:

```typescript
CreditMemoLineAdd: [
  {
    ItemRef: { ListID: "item1_list_id" },
    Desc: "Refund - Item 1",
    Amount: "30.00",
  },
  {
    ItemRef: { ListID: "item2_list_id" },
    Desc: "Refund - Item 2",
    Amount: "20.00",
  },
];
```

# Mapping your app's objects to QuickBooks Desktop
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/qbd/mapping-objects

How to handle syncing your application's data objects with QuickBooks Desktop objects.

Most complex QuickBooks Desktop (QBD) object types, such as [invoices](/api-ref/qbd/invoices) and [sales receipts](/api-ref/qbd/sales-receipts), interact with various related objects. For instance, an invoice may contain multiple line items, with each item linked to a specific QBD inventory item via an ID. **When creating these objects in QBD, you must ensure that all related objects are correctly linked.**

For effective integration, depending on the data type of these related objects and you application requirements, you can either:

1. **Create new QBD objects** and store their IDs in your application's database for future reference.
2. **Map existing QBD objects to corresponding objects in your application** through manual configurations made by users within your application's UI. Consider the following example for inventory items:
   1. Fetch all existing QBD inventory items using Conductor's API (e.g., `await conductor.qbd.inventoryItems.list()`).
   2. Display these QBD items alongside items from your application in the UI.
   3. Users can then specify mappings, or opt to create new items in QBD.
   4. Record the corresponding QBD item ID in your application's database (e.g., add a **`qbd_item_id`** column to the **`items`** table).

<Tip>
  **Important**: The need to map or create objects may vary based on object type
  (e.g., some users might prefer mapping existing QBD objects for certain types
  while creating new ones for others). Regardless, it is crucial for your
  application to store these QBD IDs in its database for all future
  interactions, ensuring no duplicate objects are created.
</Tip>


# Create a QuickBooks Desktop test instance
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/qbd/test-instance

Create your own QuickBooks Desktop test instance with an AWS WorkSpace.

export const Image = ({src, alt, width, align = "center", noShadow = false, noBorder = false, noZoom = false}) => <img src={`https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/conductor${src}`} alt={alt} width={width} noZoom={noZoom} className={`rounded-xl ${align === "center" ? "mx-auto" : ""} ${!noBorder ? "border border-gray-200 dark:border-0" : ""} ${!noShadow ? "shadow-md dark:shadow-none" : ""}`} />;

# Security and data retention
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/security

Conductor's policies on security, data retention, and data processing.

## Temporary data storage

* **Conductor does not permanently retain your end-user data (such as QuickBooks Desktop data).**
* **For operational purposes, API request logs, which include end-user data, are temporarily stored securely in a SOC 2 compliant log manager for 14 days before permanent deletion.**
* The logs are encrypted at rest using AES-256 and in transit using HTTPS/TLS.
* The logs are stored in certified data centers located in Germany and Finland within the EU.
* Access to these logs is strictly limited to authorized Conductor engineers, who use them solely for debugging, customer support, and product improvement.

## Permanent data storage

* The only data Conductor stores permanently pertains to managing and authenticating your Conductor account, connections, end-users, API keys, and projects. This does not include any end-user data.
* This data is stored in a centralized SOC 2 compliant database hosted by AWS in the US West (Oregon) region. There is no physical or logical separation of customer data within the database.
* The database is encrypted at rest and requires SSL/TLS encryption for all connections.
* Access to the database is strictly limited to authorized Conductor engineers.

## API request security

* All API requests to Conductor are authenticated using an API key and restricted to HTTPS.
* Data in transit is encrypted, and requests are processed through our SOC 2 compliant backend hosted by AWS in the US West (Oregon) region.

## Security and compliance

* **SOC 2:** Conductor is actively working toward achieving its SOC 2 certification, implementing and monitoring the necessary measures to meet the Security, Availability, and Confidentiality Trust Service Criteria. We have engaged an independent AICPA-accredited auditor to formally assess and report on Conductor's controls.
* Conductor's [Trust Center](https://trust.conductor.is) monitors our progress toward SOC 2 compliance.
* Conductor's [Privacy Policy](https://conductor.is/privacy) outlines our data handling practices.

## Data subprocessors

Conductor subprocessors are third-party entities authorized to process data to support Conductor services in accordance with our service agreements. Conductor requires each subprocessor to meet specific contractual obligations to ensure they enforce security controls and comply with data protection regulations.

| **Subprocessor** | **Function**                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Location**                   |

## Data processing

### Categories of personal data transferred

The specific categories of personal data processed will depend on what data the customer chooses to request from QuickBooks Desktop company files via Conductor's API. This could include data such as names, contact information, financial account details, transaction records, and accounting data related to the employees, contractors, customers, and vendors of the customer's end-user businesses.

### Sensitive data handling

Based on Conductor's recommended API configuration, the QuickBooks Desktop data accessible via Conductor's API typically would not include highly sensitive personal data, such as Social Security Numbers, credit card details, or bank account numbers. However, if explicitly requested by the customer via the Conductor API, some sensitive data transferred can include:

* Payroll and benefits information for employees and contractors, without direct identifiers such as Social Security Numbers.
* Confidential revenue, expense, and profitability data for end-users' businesses.
* Proprietary vendor and supplier details, contracts, and transaction terms.

Conductor applies the following safeguards to protect this sensitive data:

* **Strict purpose limitation:** Sensitive data is only used for the specific purposes of enabling end-user integrations (e.g., QuickBooks Desktop) via Conductor's API, and never for any other purposes.
* **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (AES-256) using industry-standard encryption protocols.
* **Onward transfer restrictions:** Conductor does not transfer any sensitive data to third parties or subprocessors without prior consent from the customer, and any approved transfers are governed by contracts ensuring the same level of data protection.
* **Retention limitations:** Conductor does not retain any end-user data on a permanent basis. For operational purposes, API request logs that include end-user data are temporarily stored securely in a log manager for 14 days before permanent deletion.
* **Access restrictions:** Access to sensitive customer and end-user data is restricted to only the necessary Conductor staff who have undergone specialized privacy and security training.

### Data transfer frequency

As the customer's end-users interact with the integration, data will be transferred via Conductor's API on a continuous basis, whenever the customer initiates pulling data from or pushing data to QuickBooks Desktop. The frequency and volume of these transfers will depend on how the customer designs the integration and how actively their users engage with the QuickBooks Desktop connected features.


# Connect your users via the auth flow
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/usage/auth-flow

Enable your users to securely connect their QuickBooks Desktop to your application.

The authentication flow in Conductor is a user interface walkthrough that allows your users to securely connect their QuickBooks Desktop installation to their Conductor account. For an example, check out this [demo of the auth flow](https://connect.conductor.is/qbd/demo).

There are two main approaches to integrating the auth flow with your application:

1. Integrate the auth flow with your backend to manage multiple users and connections.
2. Generate shareable auth links for getting started quickly or one-off connections.

## Integrate the auth flow with your backend

If you are building a multi-user service where each user needs to connect their QuickBooks Desktop account to your application, you'll want to integrate Conductor's QuickBooks Desktop auth flow into your backend.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an end-user">
    Consider you have an end-user of your application who needs to connect their QuickBooks Desktop to your application. Begin by creating an end-user for that user and saving their `id` to your database. You will use this `id` to match your users to their corresponding QuickBooks Desktop connection in Conductor.

    <Tip>
      If your database has a `users` table, consider creating a column called `conductor_end_user_id`.
    </Tip>

    ```ts Create an end-user
    import Conductor from "conductor-node";
    const conductor = new Conductor({ apiKey: "{{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}" });

    // Replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    const endUser = await conductor.endUsers.create({
      companyName: "{{END_USER_COMPANY_NAME}}",
      sourceId: "{{UNIQUE_ID_FROM_YOUR_DB}}",
      email: "{{END_USER_EMAIL}}",
    });

    // Save the end-user ID to your database.
    await db.users.update({
      conductorEndUserId: endUser.id,
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check if the end-user has an active QuickBooks Desktop connection">
    The next step is to initiate an auth session for your user to connect their QuickBooks Desktop. However, what if they already has an active connection? Or, what if they previously started the auth flow but didn't complete it?

    <Note>
      You must send any request and check the `error.code` to determine the
      appropriate action. The key distinction in error handling is:

      * `INTEGRATION_CONNECTION_NOT_SET_UP`: The user needs to complete the auth
        flow.
      * Other connection errors: The user needs to take a specific action (like
        restarting QuickBooks) but does not need the auth flow.
    </Note>

    Imagine your application has a web app where your users configure the integrations with their application. If you create a section for the QuickBooks Desktop integration, you can use the following approach to track whether an active connection already exists:

    ```ts Check the connection status
    try {
      // Ping to check the connection status.
      await conductor.endUsers.ping("{{END_USER_ID}}", "quickbooks_desktop");
      updateUI("QuickBooks Desktop is successfully connected!");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof ConductorIntegrationConnectionError) {
        if (error.code === "INTEGRATION_CONNECTION_NOT_SET_UP") {
          // This specific error code indicates the user needs to go through the auth
          // flow. Either they never started it, or didn't complete it.
          const authSession = await conductor.authSessions.create({
            publishableKey: "{{YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}",
            endUserId: "{{END_USER_ID}}",
          });
          updateUI("Set up your QuickBooks Desktop connection: " + authSession.authFlowUrl);
        } else {
          // Display connection errors for your user to resolve.
          updateUI("An error occurred: " + error.userFacingMessage);
        }
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```

    ***Note:** Replace `updateUI()` with your actual code that updates your application's UI based on the status or errors received.*
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a shareable auth flow link

For a quick start, particularly useful for pilot deployments or small-scale operations, generate a secure, shareable link for the QuickBooks Desktop auth flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an end-user">
    If you haven't already done so, create an end-user and save their `id`. You will use this `id` to authenticate future requests.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```ts Node.js
      import Conductor from "conductor-node";
      const conductor = new Conductor({ apiKey: "{{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}" });

      // Replace these placeholders with your own values.
      const endUser = await conductor.endUsers.create({
        companyName: "{{END_USER_COMPANY_NAME}}",
        sourceId: "{{UNIQUE_ID_FROM_YOUR_DB}}",
        email: "{{END_USER_EMAIL}}",
      });
      console.log("Save this end-user ID to auth future requests:", endUser.id);
      ```

      ```sh cURL
      curl -X POST https://api.conductor.is/v1/end-users \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}" \
        -d '{
              "companyName": "{{END_USER_COMPANY_NAME}}",
              "sourceId": "{{UNIQUE_ID_FROM_YOUR_DB}}",
              "email": "{{END_USER_EMAIL}}"
            }'
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an auth session">
    Using the end-user's ID, create an auth session with an extended link expiry time if needed:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```ts Node.js
      import Conductor from "conductor-node";
      const conductor = new Conductor({ apiKey: "{{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}" });

      const authSession = await conductor.authSessions.create({
        publishableKey: "{{YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}",
        endUserId: "{{END_USER_ID}}",
        linkExpiryMins: 60 * 24, // 24 hours
      });
      console.log("Send this link to your customer to complete the auth flow:", authSession.authFlowUrl);
      ```

      ```sh cURL
      curl -X POST https://api.conductor.is/v1/auth-sessions \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}" \
        -d '{
              "publishableKey": "{{YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}",
              "endUserId": "{{END_USER_ID}}",
              "linkExpiryMins": 1440
            }'
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the auth flow link">
    Share the generated `authFlowUrl` with your end-user to direct them to the auth flow to connect their QuickBooks Desktop instance to your application.

    The link will resemble this mock example:

    ```
    https://connect.conductor.is/qbd/auth_sess_client_secret_1234567abcdefg?key={{YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Autocomplete
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/usage/autocomplete

Use Conductor's built-in autocomplete to discover all available APIs, requests parameters, and response fields.

We highly recommend using [Conductor's client library](https://github.com/conductor-is/quickbooks-desktop-api) because it has built-in autocomplete and documentation for every API, request parameter, and response field. This feature is especially helpful for working with the QuickBooks Desktop API.

The following examples show the autocomplete in action in VS Code, though this works in any modern editor.

# Check an end-user's connection status
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/usage/connection-status



Sometimes, it is useful to check whether an end-user's connection is working. For example, you might want to display a "connection status" indicator in your app's UI.

To do this, you can use the [health check endpoint](/api-ref/qbd/utilities/health-check) to check whether the specified connection can connect and process requests end-to-end. If an error occurs, we strongly recommend displaying the error property [`error.userFacingMessage`](/usage/error-handling#user-facing-error-messages) to your end-user in your app's UI because it contains instructions for how your end-user can resolve the error.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts Node.js
  import Conductor from "conductor-node";

  const conductor = new Conductor({ apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" });

  async function main() {
    try {
      await conductor.qbd.healthCheck({
        conductorEndUserId: "end_usr_1234567abcdefg",
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Update your app's UI to display `error.userFacingMessage`, which explains
      // that the connection is failing and how to resolve the error.
    }
  }

  main();
  ```

  ```python Python
  from conductor import Conductor

  conductor = Conductor(api_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
  try:
    response = conductor.qbd.health_check(conductor_end_user_id="end_usr_1234567abcdefg")
  except Exception as e:
    # Update your app's UI to display `e.user_facing_message`, which explains
    # that the connection is failing and how to resolve the error.
    pass
  ```

  ```sh cURL
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://api.conductor.is/v1/quickbooks-desktop/health-check \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}}' \
    --header 'Conductor-End-User-Id: {{YOUR_END_USER_ID}}'

# Error handling
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/usage/error-handling

Catch and respond to connection errors, invalid requests, data problems, and more.

One of the most complicated aspects of QuickBooks Desktops is its error handling. QuickBooks's errors are often cryptic and unhelpful, and they can arise from several sources (e.g., Web Connector, QB request processor, QuickBooks Desktop itself), each using a different format and mechanism. Sometimes, their errors do not even describe what went wrong when they could! **Conductor unifies and simplifies these errors into a single, consistent error format and augments each with our own user-friendly language that describes how to resolve the issue.**

With Conductor, every error is an instance of [ConductorError](/apis/errors/object), each with plenty of useful information.

## Error types

Any error object you receive will be an instance of one of the following error types:

| Error Type                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ConductorIntegrationError`           | Raised when the third-party integration encounters an error while processing the end-user's request. This often results from an issue with the request or data handling that requires your attention to resolve.<br /><br />E.g., a `ListID` you provided was not found in QuickBooks Desktop, or an accounting value you supplied did not adhere to the integration's accounting rules.<br /><br />Refer to `error.integrationCode` for the error code returned by the integration, if available.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `ConductorIntegrationConnectionError` | Raised when a connection error occurs with the third-party integration on the end-user's side. This typically indicates an issue with the end-user's connection or configuration, which they must resolve. In other words, you cannot take action to fix these errors.<br /><br />E.g., the Web Connector failed to connect to QuickBooks Desktop on the end-user's computer.<br /><br />Refer to `error.integrationCode` for the error code returned by the integration connector, if available.<br /><br />❗ We recommend *not* triggering alerts for these errors because only the end-user can fix them. See [Global error handling](#global-error-handling) for an example of this. |
| `ConductorInvalidRequestError`        | Raised when you make an API call with the wrong parameters, in the wrong state, or in an invalid way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `ConductorAuthenticationError`        | Raised when Conductor cannot authenticate you with the credentials you provided. E.g., an incorrect API key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `ConductorPermissionError`            | Raised when you attempt to access a resource that is not allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `ConductorConnectionError`            | Raised when there was a network problem between the client (on your server) and Conductor's servers. E.g., a downed network or a bad TLS certificate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `ConductorInternalError`              | Raised when something went wrong on Conductor's end. (These are rare.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Common error codes

| Error Code                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INTEGRATION_CONNECTION_NOT_SET_UP` | Occurs when an API request is made for an end-user who has not completed the authentication flow. This typically happens when a user begins the QuickBooks Desktop setup process (creating an end-user) but doesn't finish configuring their company file connection before your app attempts to make API calls. |
| `INTEGRATION_CONNECTION_NOT_ACTIVE` | Indicates that the Web Connector connection is offline. This error occurs when Conductor hasn't received a heartbeat from Web Connector in over two minutes, suggesting the connector isn't running or is experiencing issues on the end-user's machine.                                                         |
| `QBD_CONNECTION_ERROR`              | Raised when the Web Connector is online but cannot establish a connection with QuickBooks Desktop. Common causes include having the wrong company file open, QuickBooks Desktop not running, or insufficient permissions.                                                                                        |
| `QBD_REQUEST_ERROR`                 | Indicates a QuickBooks Desktop business logic error. These errors occur when a request violates QuickBooks' business rules - for example, attempting to create a bank account with a negative opening balance or using an invalid reference to another entity.                                                   |
| `QBD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`               | Occurs when QuickBooks Desktop successfully connects but fails to respond within the expected timeframe. This can happen in scenarios where QuickBooks needs to be launched and load a large company file, or when processing requests involving substantial amounts of data.                                    |

<Note>
  These error codes are accessible via the `error.code` property of any
  `ConductorError`. For integration-specific errors, you can also reference
  `error.integrationCode` for the raw error code from QuickBooks Desktop.
</Note>

## User-facing error messages

Every [ConductorError](/apis/errors/object) includes two error messages, and you should use both:

1. `error.message`: The technical error message that you should log for debugging.
2. `error.userFacingMessage`: The descriptive user-friendly error message explicitly written for the end-user that often contains instructions helping the end-user resolve the issue.

<Note>
  Your app's UI should display `error.userFacingMessage` to your end-users for
  every `ConductorError` while logging the full `error` object for your
  debugging purposes.
</Note>

For example, see the `message` and `userFacingMessage` in the following QBD connection error:

```json Example ConductorError object
{
  "error": {
    // The developer-facing error message, which includes the QBD-provided
    // error code and the QBD-provided error message.
    "message": "QBD Connection Error (0x80040420): The QuickBooks user
      has denied access.",
    // The user-facing error message with instructions for the end-user to
    // resolve the issue.
    "userFacingMessage": "We could not connect to QuickBooks Desktop
      because we must re-authorize our connection. To fix this, open
      QuickBooks Desktop, log in as Admin, navigate to 'Edit >
      Preferences > Integrated Applications', click 'Company Preferences',
      select our app, click 'Properties...', ensure 'Allow this
      application to log in automatically' is checked, then click 'OK'.
      Then try again.",
    "type": "INTEGRATION_CONNECTION_ERROR",
    "code": "QBD_CONNECTION_ERROR",
    "httpStatusCode": 502,
    "integrationCode": "0x80040420",
    "requestId": "req_1234567890"
  }
}
```

## Specific error handling

If you need special handling for specific errors, you can wrap individual API calls, as shown below.

Using `async`/`await`:

```ts
try {
  const newAccount = await conductor.qbd.account.add(endUserId, {
    Name: "Test Account",
    AccountType: "Bank",
    OpenBalance: "100",
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ConductorError) {
    // Check `error.code`, `error.integrationCode`, etc., for special handling.
  } else {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Or in the form of a rejected promise:

```ts
conductor.qbd.account
  .add(endUserId, {
    Name: "Test Account",
    AccountType: "Bank",
    OpenBalance: "100",
  })
  .then((newAccount) => {
    // ...
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error instanceof ConductorError) {
      // Check `error.code`, `error.integrationCode`, etc., for special handling.
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  });
```

## Global error handling

It is unnecessary to wrap each API call individually, as demonstrated in the examples above. Instead, we suggest implementing a global error handler for your server, such as [`app.use((error, ...) => { ... })` in Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html#writing-error-handlers) or [`formatError` in Apollo Server](https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/#for-client-responses). Within this handler, perform the following actions:

1. For any `ConductorError` instance, display the `error.userFacingMessage` property to the end-user in your app's UI while logging the complete error object.
2. For all `ConductorError` instances, transmit the full error object to your error-tracking service (e.g., Sentry):
   * Send a **warning** for instances of `ConductorIntegrationConnectionError`, which are not actionable by you and can only be resolved by the end-user; for example, failure to connect to QuickBooks Desktop on the end-user's computer.
   * Send an **error** for all other `ConductorError` instances, such as an invalid API key.

For example, using an [Express error handler](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html#writing-error-handlers):

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import {
  ConductorError,
  ConductorIntegrationConnectionError,
} from "conductor-node";

app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
  if (error instanceof ConductorError) {
    Sentry.captureException(error, {
      level:
        error instanceof ConductorIntegrationConnectionError
          ? "warning"
          : "error",
    });
    // Return a different error message for your end-user to see in your
    // app's UI.
    res.status(500).send({ error: { message: error.userFacingMessage } });
  } else {
    // ...
  }
});
```

Or using [Apollo Server's error handler](https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/#for-client-responses):

```ts
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { unwrapResolverError } from "@apollo/server/errors";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import {
  ConductorError,
  ConductorIntegrationConnectionError,
} from "conductor-node";

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // ...
  formatError: (formattedError, error) => {
    const origError = unwrapResolverError(error);
    if (origError instanceof ConductorError) {
      Sentry.captureException(origError, {
        level:
          origError instanceof ConductorIntegrationConnectionError
            ? "warning"
            : "error",
      });
      return {
        ...formattedError,
        // Return a different error message for your end-user to see in
        // your app's UI.
        message: origError.userFacingMessage,
      };
    }
    // ...
    return formattedError;
  },
});
```


# API keys
Source: https://docs.conductor.is/usage/keys

Use API keys to authenticate API requests.

Conductor authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys. If a request does not include a valid key, Conductor returns an invalid request error.

## Secret and publishable keys

Every Conductor account has two API keys:

1. **Secret key:** Use this key to authenticate requests to Conductor's API from your server-side code. It is highly sensitive and should be deleted if leaked. Store this key securely in your server, such as in an environment variable or a credential management system. Do not store this key in Git, include it in client-side code, or expose it on a website.

2. **Publishable key:** Use this key when [creating an auth session](/api-ref/auth-sessions/create), which generates the unique [auth flow](/usage/auth-flow) URL for your end-user. Unlike the secret key, the publishable key can be safely shared, stored in Git, or included in client-side code.
