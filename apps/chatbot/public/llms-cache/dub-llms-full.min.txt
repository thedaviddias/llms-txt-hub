# Errors
Source: https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/errors
Troubleshoot problems with this comprehensive breakdown of all error codes.
Dub API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.
Here is how an error response looks like:
```json
{
"error": {
"code": "not_found",
"message": "The requested resource was not found.",
"doc_url": "https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/errors#not-found"
}
}
```
## Error Codes
Here is a list of all error codes Dub API returns:
### `bad_request`

# Introduction
Source: https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/introduction
Fundamental concepts of Dub's API.
<Info>
Dub's API is now generally available. [Read the
announcement](https://dub.co/blog/announcing-dub-api).
</Info>
## Base URL
Dub's API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.
The Base URL for all API endpoints is:
```bash Terminal
https://api.dub.co
```
## Authentication
Authentication to Dub's API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word `Bearer` followed by your API key in your requests like so:
```bash Terminal
Authorization: Bearer <Your-Token>
```
Learn more about [how to get your API key](/api-reference/tokens).
## Response Codes
The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here are a few examples:
| Code  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | The request was successful.                                                                    |
| `400` | The request was invalid or cannot be served.                                                   |
| `401` | The request requires user authentication.                                                      |
| `403` | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.                                |
| `404` | The requested resource could not be found.                                                     |
| `429` | Too many requests.                                                                             |
| `500` | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
# Pagination
Source: https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/pagination
Learn how to paginate through resources in the API.
The pagination feature allows you to retrieve a subset of resources from the API. This is useful when you have a large number of resources and you want to retrieve them in smaller chunks.
These list API methods share a common set of parameters that allow you to control the number of items returned and the page number. For example, you can:
* [retrieve a list of links](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-links)
* [retrieve a list of domains](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-domains)
* [retrieve a list of events](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-events)
## Parameters
<ParamField body="page" type="string" default="1">
The page number to retrieve. By default, the first page is returned.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="pageSize" type="string">
The number of items to retrieve per page. The default value varies by
endpoint. Maximum value is 100.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="sortBy" type="string">
The field to sort the results by.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="sortOrder" type="string">
The order to sort the results by. Can be `asc` or `desc`.
</ParamField>
## Example
The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the first page of 10 links:
<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.dub.co/links?page=1&pageSize=10 \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```
```typescript TypeScript
const res = await dub.links.list({
page: 1,
pageSize: 10,
});
```
```python Python
res = s.links.list(request={
"page": 1,
"page_size": 10,
})
```
```go Go
request := operations.GetLinksRequest{
Page: dubgo.Float64(1),
PageSize: dubgo.Float64(10),
}
ctx := context.Background()
res, err := s.Links.List(ctx, request)
```
```ruby Ruby
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::GetLinksRequest.new(
page: 1,
page_size: 10,
)
res = s.links.list(req)
```
</CodeGroup>
# Rate limits
Source: https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/rate-limits
Learn about Dub's API rate limits.
Dub's API rate limiting is in conformance with the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):
| Header Name             | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.              |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.    |
| `Retry-After`           | The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request again.                |
Dub's API is capped at **60 requests per minute** per key on the Free plan, with elevated limits for [Pro plan](https://dub.co/help/article/pro-plan) and above.
This is implemented to ensure a fair usage policy so that excessive use by a single user does not adversely affect the performance and usage of the API by others.
You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the rate limit is exceeded.
## Rate limits by plan
Depending on your Dub plan, you can expect the following rate limits:
| Plan                                                  | Rate limit                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free                                                  | 60 requests per minute                                               |
| [Pro](https://dub.co/help/article/pro-plan)           | 600 requests per minute                                              |
| [Business](https://dub.co/help/article/business-plan) | 3,000 requests per minute                                            |
| [Enterprise](https://dub.co/enterprise)               | Custom – [reach out to sales](https://dub.co/enterprise) for details |
## How to comply with rate limits
Here are some tips on how you can optimize your API setup to comply with our rate limits:
### 1. Bulk link creation
If you need to create a lot of links within a short period of time, try our [bulk link creation endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-create-links) instead (create up to 100 links in one API call)
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
await dub.links.createMany([
{
url: "https://google.com",
},
{
url: "https://twitter.com",
},
{
url: "https://linkedin.com",
},
]);
```
```python Python
res = d.links.create_many(request=[
{
url: "https://google.com",
},
{
url: "https://twitter.com",
},
{
url: "https://linkedin.com",
},
]);
```
```go Go
var request []operations.RequestBody =
[]operations.RequestBody{
operations.RequestBody{
URL: "https://google.com",
},
operations.RequestBody{
URL: "https://twitter.com",
},
operations.RequestBody{
URL: "https://linkedin.com",
},
}
ctx := context.Background()
res, err := s.Links.CreateMany(ctx, request)
```
```ruby Ruby
s.links.create_many(
::OpenApiSDK::Operations::BulkCreateLinksRequest.new(
request_body: [
::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RequestBody.new(
url: "https://google.com",
),
::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RequestBody.new(
url: "https://twitter.com",
),
::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RequestBody.new(
url: "https://linkedin.com",
),
]
)
)
```
</CodeGroup>
### 2. Fetch workspace-level analytics
If you're using our [Analytics API](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics), instead of retrieving the clicks count for every single link, try making a single API call to get workspace-level click analytics instead.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
await dub.analytics.retrieve({
groupBy: "top_links",
start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
});
```
```python Python
res = d.analytics.retrieve(request={
"groupBy": "top_links",
"start": "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
})
```
```go Go
func main() {
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
request := operations.RetrieveAnalyticsRequest{
GroupBy: "top_links",
Start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
}
ctx := context.Background()
res, err := d.Analytics.Retrieve(ctx, request)
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res.OneOf != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```ruby Ruby
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RetrieveAnalyticsRequest.new(
group_by: ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::GroupBy::TOP_LINKS,
start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
)
res = dub.analytics.retrieve(req)
puts res.raw_response.body
```
</CodeGroup>
### 3. Leverage webhooks
If you're expecting high volume, fast-changing data (e.g. thousands of clicks on your links per day) and would prefer to store the data on your end, we recommend using our [real-time webhooks feature](https://dub.co/blog/introducing-webhooks) instead.
<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.dub.co/blog/webhook-event-logs.jpg" alt="Webhook event logs" />
</Frame>
[Webhooks](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) are *push-based*, meaning that Dub will send events to your webhook receiver endpoint when specific events occur, while a REST API is *pull-based*, meaning that you need to consistently poll the API endpoint to get real-time updates.
Check out our [webhooks documentation](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) to learn more.
# API Keys
Source: https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/tokens
Learn how API keys work on Dub.
API keys on Dub allow you to access your workspace programmatically. This is useful for integrating Dub into your application or with other tools and services.
Each API key is tied to a specific workspace – meaning you can use it to access that workspace's resources without having to worry about "leaking" access to other workspaces.
API keys on Dub follow the format:
```bash .env
DUB_API_KEY=dub_xxxxxxxx
```
By default, you can use this key to perform any API request without restriction, so it must be stored securely in your app's server-side code (such as in an environment variable or credential management system). Don’t expose this key on a website.
## Create an API key
You can create an API key by following these steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Go to your workspace">
Go to **Settings** > [**API Keys**](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens) in your workspace.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/workspace-api-keys.png" alt="Workspace API keys on Dub" width="1468" height="249" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Create an API Key">
Click on the "Create" button and select permissions you want to grant to
the API key.
Select between "You" and "Machine" to associate the API key with your account or a [machine user](#machine-users).
* **You**: This API key is tied to your user and can make requests against the selected workspace.
* **Machine**: A machine user will be added to your workspace, and an API key associated with that machine user will be created.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/add-new-api-key.png" alt="Add new API key on Dub" width="1468" height="249" />
</Frame>
Click on the **Create API Key** button to create the key. Make sure to copy your API key and store it in a safe place. You won't be able to see it again.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/api-key-created.png" alt="API Key created on Dub" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Use your API Key">
Now that you have your API key, you can use it to access your workspace's resources programmatically via SDKs or within any API request as a bearer token.
```
Authorization: Bearer dub_xxxx
```
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
We recommend creating API keys with the least privilege necessary to perform
the required tasks. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
your workspace.
</Tip>
## API key permissions
When creating a secret key, you can select the permissions it has, which will give the key access to certain (or all) resources on Dub. Here are the different permission options:
| Permission          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All permissions** | This API key will have full access to all resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Read only**       | This API key will have read-only access to all resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Restricted**      | This API key will have restricted access to some resources: <ul><li>[Links](/data-model#links)</li><li>[Analytics](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics)</li><li>[Workspaces](/data-model#workspace)</li><li>[Domains](/data-model#domains)</li><li>[Tags](/data-model#tags)</li></ul> |
Depending on your use case, you might want to use one of these 3 options to limit the scope of the API key and improve security. When making API calls, if your API key has insufficient permissions, the error should tell you which permissions you need.
<Tip>
You can only set permissions on Secret keys. Publishable keys only have access
to certain endpoints, and cannot be restricted.
</Tip>
## Machine users
On Dub, you can create API keys that are associated with a "Machine user". This is particularly helpful when you don't want to associate the API key with a particular user in your workspace, to avoid security risks in involving turnover or changes in project ownership.
<Warning>
Machine users share the same permissions as the [owner
role](https://dub.co/help/article/workspace-roles#owner-role) in a workspace.
Make sure to only create machine users for trusted applications.
</Warning>
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/api-machine-users.png" alt="Creating an API key associated with a machine user on Dub" width="1528" height="974" />
</Frame>
These machine users will show up on your workspace's **People** tab, but will not contribute to your workspace's user count.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/machine-user.png" alt="Machine user on Dub" width="1468" height="249" />
</Frame>
<Tip>
If you delete an API key associated with a machine user, the machine user will
be deleted. Vice versa, if you delete a machine user, their corresponding API
key will be deleted as well.
</Tip>

# Bulk actions
Source: https://dub.co/docs/concepts/links/bulk-actions
Learn how to perform bulk actions on links.
Dub allows you to perform bulk actions on links. This is particularly useful when you need to create, update, or delete multiple links at once without having to make multiple API requests.
## Bulk create links
Bulk create allows you to create up to 100 links at once.
<Warning>
Bulk link creation does not support [custom link
previews](https://dub.co/help/article/custom-link-previews). Also, [webhook
events](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) will not be triggered when using bulk
link creation.
</Warning>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const result = await dub.links.createMany([
{
url: "https://google.com",
},
{
url: "https://google.uk",
},
]);
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
}
res, err := s.Links.CreateMany(ctx, []operations.RequestBody{
operations.RequestBody{
URL: "https://google.com",
},
operations.RequestBody{
URL: "https://google.uk",
},
})
```
```python Python

from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = dub.links.create_many(request=[
{
"url": "https://google.com",
},
{
"url": "https://google.uk",
},
])
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(

## Bulk update links
Bulk update allows you to modify up to 100 links simultaneously **with the same data**.
Some potential use cases:
* Tagging multiple links at once
* Setting the same expiration date for multiple links
* Updating UTM parameters for multiple links
<Warning>
You cannot update the domain or key of a link with this endpoint. Also,
[webhook events](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) will not be triggered when
using bulk link updates
</Warning>
<CodeGroup>

# Introduction
Source: https://dub.co/docs/concepts/links/introduction
Learn how to use Dub's links to track and analyze your marketing campaigns.
Links are the bread and butter of [Dub](https://dub.co).
Everything on Dub starts with a link. Whether you're creating:
* a handful of links for your marketing campaign
* hundreds of links for your affiliate program
* thousands of links, [programmatically](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-create-links), for your SMS campaign
In this guide, we'll cover the link model, how to create links, and more.
## The link model
The link model consists of the following properties:
| Property    | Description                                               | Example                         |
| ----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `id`        | The unique identifier of the link (prefixed with `link_`) | `link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd` |
| `url`       | The destination URL of the link                           | `https://dub.co/home`           |
| `shortLink` | The shortened version of the link (including https)       | `https://dub.link/claim`        |
| `domain`    | The domain of the link                                    | `dub.link`                      |
| `key`       | The short link slug                                       | `claim`                         |

You can use the various Dub SDKs to programmatically manage your links.
## Create a link
The `url` field, representing the destination URL, is the sole mandatory parameter required for the creation of a new short link.
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://google.com",
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Create(ctx, &operations.CreateLinkRequestBody{
URL: "https://google.com",
})
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = d.links.create(request={
"url": "https://google.com",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequestBody.new(
url: "https://google.com",
)
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$request = new Operations\CreateLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://google.com',
);
$response = $sdk->links->create(
request: $request
);
```
```bash cURL {5}
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.dub.co/links \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"url": "https://google.com"}'
```
</CodeGroup>
## Update a link
An existing link can be updated by providing the `id` to the `update` method. This method returns the updated link as a response.
You can use either the `linkId` or an `externalId` prefixed with `ext_` which is a unique identifier for the link in your own database to associate it with the link in Dub's system.
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.update("link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Update(ctx, "link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd", &operations.UpdateLinkRequestBody{
URL: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
})
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = dub.links.update(link_id="link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd", request_body={
"url": "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
res = s.links.update(link_id="link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd", request_body={
"url": "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
})
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$requestBody = new Operations\UpdateLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://www.google.uk', // new URL
);
$response = $sdk->links->update(
linkId: 'link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd',
requestBody: $requestBody
);
```
```bash cURL
curl --request PATCH \
--url https://api.dub.co/links/link_eBKA4MT44XnI17hYLchkjUOd \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"url": "https://www.google.uk"}'
```
</CodeGroup>
## Upsert a link
Upserting a link is a combination of creating and updating a link. If a link with the same URL already exists, return it (or update it if there are any changes). Otherwise, a new link will be created.
This allows you to use the upsert method without the necessity of checking for the link's existence beforehand.
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.upsert({
url: "https://google.com", // will always be the same short link
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Upsert(ctx, &operations.UpsertLinkRequestBody{
URL: "https://google.com",
})
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = d.links.upsert(request={
"url": "https://google.com",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::UpsertLinkRequestBody.new(
url: "https://google.com",
)
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$request = new Operations\UpsertLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://google.com',
);
$response = $sdk->links->upsert(
request: $request
);
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \

# Organizing links
Source: https://dub.co/docs/concepts/links/organization
Learn how to associate links with users, campaigns, teams, and other entities within your system.
When creating links programmatically with Dub, you might want a way to associate them with a user or other identifiers in your system.
There are a few ways to do this, depending on your data structure:

## External ID
In certain scenarios, it is essential to identify links within your system. For instance, you may need to associate a link with a user without storing the Dub link ID directly in your database (e.g. for referral links).
The `externalId` field serves this purpose effectively. It acts as a unique identifier within your database, allowing you to associate it with a corresponding link in Dub's system.
Dub allows you to create links using an `externalId` and subsequently retrieve them by the same identifier.
<Note>
`externalId` should be a unique value across your workspace. Trying to create
a link with an externalId that already exists will result in a [`409` conflict
error](/api-reference/errors#conflict) error.
</Note>
### Create link with an externalId
Here is an example of how to create a link with an `externalId`:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://google.com",
externalId: "12345",
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Create(ctx, &operations.CreateLinkRequestBody{
URL: "https://google.com",
ExternalId: "12345",
})
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = d.links.create(request={
"url": "https://google.com",
"external_id": "12345",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequestBody.new(
url: "https://google.com",
external_id: "12345",
)
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$request = new Operations\CreateLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://google.com',
externalId: '12345',
);
$response = $sdk->links->create(
request: $request
);
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.dub.co/links \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"url": "https://google.com",
"external_id": "12345"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
### Retrieve link by externalId
Let's see how to retrieve a link by its `externalId`:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.get({
externalId: "12345",
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Get(ctx, operations.GetLinkInfoRequest{
ExternalID: dubgo.String("12345"),
})
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = d.links.get(request={
"external_id": "12345",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::GetLinkInfoRequest.new(
external_id: "12345",
)
res = s.links.get(req)
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$response = $sdk->links->get(
externalId: '12345'
);
```
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.dub.co/links/info?external_id=12345 \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
</CodeGroup>
### Update link by externalId
In addition to updating a link by its `linkId`, you can also update a link by its `externalId`.
<Note>
Make sure to prefix the `externalId` with `ext_`. For example, if your
`externalId` is `12345`, you should pass `ext_12345`.
</Note>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.update("ext_12345", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Update(ctx, "ext_12345", &operations.UpdateLinkRequestBody{
URL: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
})
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = dub.links.update(link_id="ext_12345", request_body={
"url": "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(

```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$requestBody = new Operations\UpdateLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://www.google.uk', // new URL
);
$response = $sdk->links->update(
linkId: 'ext_12345',
requestBody: $requestBody

### Retrieve analytics by externalId
You can also retrieve analytics for a link by its `externalId`. This is helpful for fetching the analytics for a given link using the unique identifier from your system.
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const analytics = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
externalId: "ext_12345",
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Analytics.Retrieve(ctx, operations.RetrieveAnalyticsRequest{
ExternalID: dubgo.String("ext_12345"),
})
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = dub.analytics.retrieve(request={
"external_id": "ext_12345",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RetrieveAnalyticsRequest.new(
external_id: "ext_12345",
)
res = s.analytics.retrieve(req)
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$request = new Operations\RetrieveAnalyticsRequest(
externalId: "ext_12345",
);
$response = $sdk->analytics->retrieve(
request: $request
);
```
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.dub.co/analytics?external_id=ext_12345 \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Tenant ID
The ID of the tenant that created the link inside your system. If set, it can be used to fetch all links for a tenant. This is useful if you have a system that lets your users create their own links, and you want to group them on a tenant level.
### Create link with tenantId
Let's see how to create a link with a tenant ID:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY,
});
const link = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://google.com",
tenantId: "12345",
});
```
```go Go
package main
import(
"context"
dubgo "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"github.com/dubinc/dub-go/models/operations"
"log"
"os"
)
func main() {
ctx := context.Background()
s := dubgo.New(
dubgo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
res, err := s.Links.Create(ctx, &operations.CreateLinkRequestBody{
URL: "https://google.com",
TenantId: "12345",
})
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
if res != nil {
// handle response
}
}
```
```python Python
import os
import dub
from dub.models import operations
d = dub.Dub(
token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'],
)
res = d.links.create(request={
"url": "https://google.com",
"tenant_id": "12345",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
s = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
s.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: "DUB_API_KEY",
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequestBody.new(
url: "https://google.com",
tenant_id: "12345",
)
```
```php PHP
declare(strict_types=1);
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$sdk = Dub\Dub::builder()->setSecurity('DUB_API_KEY')->build();
$request = new Operations\CreateLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://google.com',
tenantId: '12345',
);
$response = $sdk->links->create(
request: $request
);
```
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.dub.co/links \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"url": "https://google.com",

## Tags
Tags are a great way to organize your links on Dub.
With tags, you can:
* Organize your links by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
* [Filter your links by tags](#retrieve-links-by-tags) and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
* [Filter your analytics by tags](#retrieve-analytics-by-tags) to see how your campaigns are performing.
### Create link with tags
You can use either pass the tag ID or tag name to create a link with tags.

# Event types
Source: https://dub.co/docs/concepts/webhooks/event-types
List of available webhook events you can listen to along with their payload examples
Webhooks are a great way to get real-time notifications on events that happen in your Dub workspace. Webhooks on Dub follow the following format:
```json webhook-payload.json
{
"id": "evt_KleiO4HBwZFbO1vZLWIPZ2AtX", // The event ID
"event": "link.created", // The event type
"createdAt": "2024-08-26T16:41:52.346Z", // The timestamp of when the event was created
"data": {
// Event payload
}
}
```
There are two types of webhook events you can listen to:
* [**Workspace-level events**](#workspace-level-events)
* [**Link-level events**](#link-level-events)
## Workspace-level events
These events are triggered in the context of your entire workspace:
* [`link.created`](#link-created)
* [`link.updated`](#link-updated)
* [`link.deleted`](#link-deleted)
* [`lead.created`](#lead-created)
* [`sale.created`](#sale-created)
### `link.created`
This event is triggered when a [new link is created](/api-reference/endpoint/create-a-new-link) in your Dub workspace. The event payload contains the created link's details.
Here's an example payload:
<Accordion title="Sample payload">
```json link.created
{
"id": "evt_KleiO4HBwZFbO1vZLWIPZ2AtX",
"event": "link.created",
"createdAt": "2024-08-26T16:41:52.346Z",

## Link-level events
Due to the high volume nature of these events, these events are scoped to a specific link.
This means that you need to specify the link when creating a webhook – though you can select multiple links for the same webhook if you'd like.
### `link.clicked`
This event is triggered when a user [clicks on a link](/conversions/clicks/introduction). The event payload contains all the details about the click event.
Here's an example payload:
<Accordion title="Sample payload">
```json link.clicked

# Introduction
Source: https://dub.co/docs/concepts/webhooks/introduction
Use webhooks to get real-time notifications on events happening across your Dub workspace.
Webhooks allows you to listen to real-time events happening across your Dub workspace. With webhooks, you can build custom integrations with Dub, such as:
* Triggering a Zap on [Zapier](/integrations/zapier) when a new link is created in Dub
* Sending click events in real-time to [Segment](/integrations/segment) for further processing
* Get a [Slack](/integrations/slack) notification when someone clicks on your pitch deck link
* Building gamified referral programs with [Dub Conversions](/conversions/quickstart) – e.g. increment usage credits for the referrer when a [new signup](/conversions/leads) happens
<Warning>
The following endpoints do not trigger webhook events: [Bulk create
links](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-create-links), [Bulk update
links](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-update-links), [Bulk delete
links](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-delete-links).
</Warning>
In this guide, we'll show you how to configure webhooks for your Dub workspace and a list of available events you can listen to.
## Creating a webhook
To create a webhook for your Dub workspace, you'll need to follow these steps:
Navigate to the [**Webhooks** settings page](https://app.dub.co/webhooks) in your Dub workspace.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/create-webhook.png" alt="Create Webhook" />
</Frame>
Click on **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/create-webhook-form.png" alt="Create Webhook Form" />
</Frame>
Fill in the required fields in the webhook creation form:
1. **Name**: Give your webhook a name that helps you identify it.
2. **URL**: Enter the URL of the endpoint where you want to send the webhook. We recommend using [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to test your webhook.
3. **Signing secret**: This is an auto-generated secret key that you can use to verify the authenticity of the webhook in your application. Learn more about [verifying webhook requests](/concepts/webhooks/verify-webhook-requests).
4. **Events**: Select the events you want to listen to. You can select multiple events. Refer to the [Event Types](/concepts/webhooks/event-types) section to see the list of available events.
Finally, click on **Create webhook** to create the webhook.
## Viewing webhook event logs
We also provide you with a webhook event logs page where you can view all the webhook events that have been sent to your webhook endpoint in real-time.
To view the webhook event logs, select the webhook from the [**Webhooks** settings page](https://app.dub.co/webhooks) and click on the **Webhook Logs** tab.
Here, you'll see a list of all the webhook events that have been sent to your webhook endpoint:
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/webhook-event-logs.png" alt="Webhook Event Logs" />
</Frame>
You can also select on a specific event, which will open up a sheet with more details about the event:
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/webhook-event-logs-details.png" alt="Webhook Event Logs Details" />
</Frame>
## Sending test events
You can send test events to your webhook URL to ensure that it's working correctly. To do this:
<Steps>
<Step title="Go to the webhook details page">
Navigate to the [**Webhooks** settings page](https://app.dub.co/webhooks) and select the webhook you want to test.
Click on the **Update Details** tab to open the webhook details page.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the test event modal">
Select the `⋮` icon on the top right of the page, and click on **Send test event**.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/send-test-event.png" alt="Send Test Event" />
</Frame>
This will open up a modal where you can select the event you want to send.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/send-test-event-modal.png" alt="Send Test Event Modal" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Send the test event">
Select the event you want to send, and click on **Send test webhook**.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/send-test-webhook.png" alt="Send Test Webhook" />
</Frame>
You'll see a success message and receive the webhook event in the webhook endpoint you specified.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Retry Behaviour
If your webhook endpoint does not respond with a success status code (2XX), we retry the request to ensure every message will be delivered. You can see all the retry attempts in your webhook event logs.
Webhooks are retried until they are successfully delivered – with an exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming your webhook endpoint (also known as the "[thundering herd problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem)"). The delay is capped at 24 hours from the 5th retry attempt onwards.
| Retry attempt | Delay    |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 1st           | 12s      |
| 2nd           | 2m 28s   |
| 3rd           | 30m 8s   |
| 4th           | 6h 7m 6s |
| 5th           | 24h      |
| 6th           | 24h      |
| ...           | ...      |
### Temporary Disablement
If a webhook endpoint consistently fails, it will be automatically disabled after a series of failed attempts.
Notifications will be sent to the Workspace owners at the following intervals:
* After 5, 10, and 15 consecutive failed attempts.
* On the 20th consecutive failed attempt, the **webhook will be disabled**.
This mechanism ensures that non-responsive endpoints do not continue to receive retry attempts indefinitely, maintaining system efficiency and preventing unnecessary load on both the sender and receiver.
You can re-enable a disabled webhook by clicking on the **Enable webhook** button in the webhook details page.
# Verify webhook requests
Source: https://dub.co/docs/concepts/webhooks/verify-webhook-requests
Learn how to verify webhook requests to ensure they're coming from Dub.
With signature verification, you can determine if the webhook came from Dub, and has not been tampered with in transit.
All webhooks are delivered with a `Dub-Signature` header. Dub generates this header using a secret key that only you and Dub know.
An example header looks like this:
```
Dub-Signature: c9ed6a2abf93f59d761eea69908d8de00f4437b5b6d7cd8b9bf5719cbe61bf46
```
## Finding your webhook's signing secret
You can find your webhook's signing secret in the **Update Details** tab:
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/webhook-signing-secret.png" alt="Webhook signing secret" />
</Frame>
Make sure to keep this secret safe by only storing it in a secure environment variable (e.g. `DUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). Do not commit it to git or add it in any client-side code.
## Verifying a webhook request
To verify, you can use the secret key to generate your own signature for each webhook. If both signatures match then you can be sure that a received event came from Dub.
The steps required are:
1. Get the raw body of the request.
2. Extract the signature from the `Dub-Signature` header.
3. Calculate the HMAC of the raw body using the `SHA-256` hash function and the secret.
4. Compare the calculated `HMAC` with the one sent in the `Dub-Signature` header. If they match, the webhook is verified.
Here's an example of how you can verify a webhook request in different languages:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Next.js
export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
const webhookSignature = req.headers.get("Dub-Signature");
if (!webhookSignature) {
return new Response("No signature provided.", { status: 401 });
}
// Copy this from the webhook details page
const secret = process.env.DUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
if (!secret) {
return new Response("No secret provided.", { status: 401 });
}
// Make sure to get the raw body from the request
const rawBody = await req.text();
const computedSignature = crypto
.createHmac("sha256", secret)
.update(rawBody)
.digest("hex");
if (webhookSignature !== computedSignature) {
return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 400 });
}
// Handle the webhook event
// ...
};
```
```python Python
import hmac
import hashlib
def webhook():
# Get the signature from the header
webhook_signature = request.headers.get('Dub-Signature')
if not webhook_signature:
abort(401, 'No signature provided.')
# Copy this from the webhook details page
secret = os.environ.get('DUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
if not secret:
abort(401, 'No secret provided.')
# Get the raw body of the request
raw_body = request.data
# Calculate the HMAC
computed_signature = hmac.new(
secret.encode('utf-8'),
raw_body,
hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()
if webhook_signature != computed_signature:
abort(400, 'Invalid signature')
# Handle the webhook event
# ...
return 'OK', 200
```
```go Go
import (
"crypto/hmac"
"crypto/sha256"
"encoding/hex"
"io/ioutil"
"net/http"
"os"
)
func webhookHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
// Get the signature from the header
webhookSignature := r.Header.Get("Dub-Signature")
if webhookSignature == "" {
http.Error(w, "No signature provided.", http.StatusUnauthorized)
return
}
// Copy this from the webhook details page
secret := os.Getenv("DUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET")
if secret == "" {
http.Error(w, "No secret provided.", http.StatusUnauthorized)
return
}
// Read the raw body
body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
if err != nil {
http.Error(w, "Error reading request body", http.StatusInternalServerError)
return
}
// Calculate the HMAC
h := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secret))
h.Write(body)
computedSignature := hex.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil))
if webhookSignature != computedSignature {
http.Error(w, "Invalid signature", http.StatusBadRequest)
return
}
// Handle the webhook event
// ...
w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
w.Write([]byte("OK"))
}
```
</CodeGroup>
## Why is signature verification important?
Signature verification is a crucial security measure that protects against request forgery and data tampering. Without verification, malicious actors could send fake webhook events to your endpoint, potentially triggering unauthorized actions.
The HMAC-SHA256 signature verification process ensures that only Dub can generate valid webhook requests and that payloads haven't been modified in transit. This provides both authentication (confirming the sender is Dub) and integrity (ensuring the message hasn't been tampered with).
# Introduction
Source: https://dub.co/docs/conversions/clicks/introduction
Click-tracking with Dub Conversions
Clicks are the starting point for all conversion events on Dub.
A click event can be triggered by:
* A user clicking on a [Dub link](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link)
* A user scanning a [Dub QR code](https://dub.co/features/qr-codes)
In [Dub Analytics](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics), you can [filter between QR code scans and link clicks](https://dub.co/help/article/filter-analytics-by-trigger), giving you a full picture of how your various marketing channels are performing.
Clicks are tracked automatically for all Dub short links upon a redirect event – and you also have the flexibility to track clicks via query parameters using our [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).
## Server-side click-tracking
Server-side click-tracking is enabled by default for all Dub links and come with the following attributes:
| Attribute    | Type    | Description                                                                                      |
| :----------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`  | string  | The timestamp of the click event                                                                 |
| `id`         | string  | The unique ID of the click event                                                                 |
| `url`        | string  | The destination URL that the link resolved to – this can vary if geo/device-targeting is enabled |
| `continent`  | string  | The continent of the user who clicked the link                                                   |
| `country`    | string  | The country of the user who clicked the link                                                     |
| `city`       | string  | The city of the user who clicked the link                                                        |
| `device`     | string  | The device of the user who clicked the link                                                      |
| `browser`    | string  | The browser of the user who clicked the link                                                     |
| `os`         | string  | The operating system of the user who clicked the link                                            |
| `referer`    | string  | The referrer of the user who clicked the link                                                    |
| `refererUrl` | string  | The full referrer URL of the user who clicked the link                                           |
| `qr`         | boolean | Whether the click event was triggered by a QR code scan                                          |
| `ip`         | string  | The IP address of the user who clicked the link (non-EU users only)                              |
These events happen on the server-side and cannot be blocked by browser extensions or ad-blockers, which improves the accuracy of your analytics data.
## Client-side click-tracking
Alternatively, you can track clicks on the client-side using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`, `?ref=jane`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.
A few use cases include:
* You are migrating from an existing affiliate management platform that uses query parameters to track conversions and don't want ask your affiliates to update all their links
* You have dynamically generated referral pages (e.g. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/referral/peeroke520149)) and want to track clicks using a `track()` function inside your application code.
* You need to use an unfurled URL for the platform you're sharing the link on (no short links allowed)
With our [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction), you can do exactly that. Here's how you can enable client-side click-tracking for your links:
### Step 1: Add a custom domain to your Dub workspace
First, you'll need to [add a custom short link domain](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) to your Dub workspace.
This is the domain that you'll use for your short links, as well as the `shortDomain` attribute in the following steps.
### Step 2: Allowlist the your site's domain
Then, you'll need to allowlist your site's domain to allow the client-side click events to be ingested by Dub. To do that, navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics) and add your site's domain to the **Allowed Hostnames** list.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/allowed-hostnames.png" alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a workspace" />
</Frame>
<Tip>
When testing things out locally, you can add `localhost` to the **Allowed
Hostnames** list temporarily. This will allow local events to be ingested by
Dub. Don't forget to remove it once you're ready to go live!
</Tip>
### Step 3: Install the Dub Client-side SDK
Lastly, you'll need to install the Dub [Client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction) and initialize it with the domain you added in the previous step.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React/Next.js
// install the package (e.g. npm install @dub/analytics)
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";
export default function App() {
return (
<Layout>
<DubAnalytics
domainsConfig={{
refer: "go.example.com", // the custom domain you're using on Dub for your short links
}}
queryParam="via" // optional: query parameter to listen to for client-side click-tracking (default: "via")
/>
{/* Your app code here */}
</Layout>
);
}
```
```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
data-domains='{"refer": "go.example.com"}'
defer
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
Here's the full list of parameters you can pass to the `<Analytics />` component:
<Accordion title="Parameters">
<ParamField body="apiHost" type="url" default="https://api.dub.co">
The base URL for the Dub API. This is useful for [setting up reverse
proxies](/conversions/clicks/introduction#step-4-optional-but-recommended-set-up-a-reverse-proxy)
to avoid adblockers.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="attributionModel" type="first-click | last-click" default="last-click">
The attribution model to use for the analytics event. The following
attribution models are available:
* `first-click`: The first click model
gives all the credit to the first touchpoint in the customer journey.
* `last-click`: The last click model gives all the credit to the last
touchpoint in the customer journey.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="cookieOptions" type="CookieOption Object">
<Expandable title="properties">
<ParamField body="domain" type="string">
Specifies the value for the `Domain` Set-Cookie attribute. This is useful
for cross-domain tracking. Example: `.example.com`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expires" type="integer" default="90">
Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the `Expires` Set-Cookie
attribute. Example: `new Date('2024-12-31')`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expiresInDays" type="integer" default="90">
Specifies the number (in days) to be the value for the `Expires`
Set-Cookie attribute. Example: `90`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="path" type="string" default="/">
Specifies the value for the `Path` Set-Cookie attribute. By default, the
path is considered the "default path". Example: `/`
</ParamField>
</Expandable>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="domainsConfig" type="JSON-stringified object">
Configure the domains that Dub will track. The following properties are available:
<Expandable title="properties">
<ParamField body="refer" type="string">
The Dub custom domain for [referral program client-side click tracking](http://d.to/clicks/refer)
(previously `shortDomain`).
Example: `refer.dub.co`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="site" type="string">
The Dub short domain for tracking site visits.
Example: `site.dub.co`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="outbound" type="string | string[]">

`dub_id` cookie will be automatically appended to all outbound links
targeting these domains to enable cross-domain tracking across different
applications.
Example: `["dub.sh", "git.new"]`
</ParamField>
</Expandable>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="shortDomain" type="string" deprecated>
\[Deprecated: Use `domainsConfig.refer` instead] The Dub custom domain for
[referral program client-side click tracking](http://d.to/clicks/refer).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="queryParam" type="string" default="via">
The query parameter to listen to for client-side click-tracking (e.g.
`?via=abc123`).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="scriptProps" type="HTMLScriptElement Object">
Custom properties to pass to the script tag. Refer to
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement) for
all available options.
</ParamField>
</Accordion>
### Step 4 (Optional, but recommended): Set up a reverse proxy
To avoid ad-blockers from blocking your click-tracking requests, we recommend setting up a reverse proxy.
Depending on which backend framework you're using, there are a few different ways to do this:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Next.js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
async rewrites() {
return [
{
source: "/_proxy/dub/track/:path",
destination: "https://api.dub.co/track/:path",
},
];
},
};
```
```json Vercel
// vercel.json
{
"rewrites": [
{
"source": "/_proxy/dub/track/:path",
"destination": "https://api.dub.co/track/:path"
}
]
}
```
</CodeGroup>
Once you've set up your reverse proxy, don't forget to update the `apiHost` parameter in the `<Analytics />` component to point to your proxy URL.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React/Next.js
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";
export default function App() {
return (
<Layout>
<DubAnalytics
apiHost="/_proxy/dub" // the URL of your reverse proxy
domainsConfig={{
refer: "go.example.com", // the custom domain you're using on Dub for your short links
}}
queryParam="via" // optional: query parameter to listen to for client-side click-tracking (default: "via")
/>
{/* Your app code here */}
</Layout>
);
}
```
```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
data-api-host="/_proxy/dub"
data-domains='{"refer": "go.example.com"}'
defer
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
### Step 5: Verify your setup
To verify that your click-tracking is working, run your website locally and append the URL with:
* The specific query parameter + you specified in [Step 3](#step-3-install-the-dub-client-side-sdk)
* The unique key of your short link
For example, if the query parameter you specified in Step 3 is `via` and your short link is `https://go.example.com/abc123`, you'll need to append `?via=abc123` to the URL.
Once you've done that, check if the following is true:
1. The click tracked correctly in the [**Analytics**](https://app.dub.co/analytics) tab of your Dub workspace.
2. There is a successful `/track/click` request in your browser's **Network** tab (and no errors in the **Console** tab).
3. The `dub_id` cookie is being set in your browser upon a successful click-tracking request.
# Appwrite
Source: https://dub.co/docs/conversions/leads/appwrite
Learn how to track lead conversion events with Appwrite and Dub
When it comes to conversion tracking, a `lead` event happens when a user performs an action that indicates interest in your product or service. This could be anything from:
* Signing up for an account
* Adding a product to cart
* Joining a mailing list
<Frame>
<img className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-lead-event.png" alt="A diagram showing how lead events are tracked in the conversion funnel" />
</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application that uses Appwrite for user authentication.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
## Configure Appwrite
Next, configure Appwrite to track lead conversion events during the sign up process.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Appwrite Cloud project">
Head to [Appwrite Cloud](https://apwr.dev/appwrite-dub) and create a new project.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/appwrite/appwrite-new-project.png" alt="New project on Appwrite Cloud" width="1440" height="1024" />
</Frame>
Create a new API key with the `sessions.write` scope enabled and save the API key for later use. You can also copy your project ID and endpoint from the project's Settings page.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/appwrite/appwrite-api-key.png" alt="API key in your project on Appwrite Cloud" width="1440" height="1024" />
</Frame>
Then, in your Next.js app, install the Appwrite Node.js SDK.
```bash
npm i node-appwrite
```
</Step>
<Step title="Add environment variables">
Add the following environment variables to your app.
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=<APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID>
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=<APPWRITE_API_KEY>
NEXT_DUB_API_KEY=<DUB_API_KEY>
```
</Step>
<Step title="Integrate Dub Analytics">
Add the `DubAnalytics` component from the `@dub/analytics` package to your app’s root layout.
```tsx src/app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from '@dub/analytics/react';
export const metadata: Metadata = {
title: 'Appwrite Dub Leads Example',
description: 'Appwrite Dub Leads Tracking example app with Next.js'
};
export default function RootLayout({
children
}: Readonly<{
children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
return (
<html lang="en">
<body>{children}</body>
<DubAnalytics />
</html>
);
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Prepare the Appwrite client and auth library">
Create the Appwrite Session and Admin client (necessary for SSR apps, as explained in the [Appwrite docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/server-side-rendering)). Additionally, create a function to verify user login.
```ts src/lib/server/appwrite.ts
'use server';
import { Client, Account } from 'node-appwrite';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
export async function createSessionClient() {
const client = new Client()
.setEndpoint(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT as string)
.setProject(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT as string);
const session = (await cookies()).get('my-custom-session');
if (!session || !session.value) {
throw new Error('No session');
}
client.setSession(session.value);
return {
get account() {
return new Account(client);
}
};
}
export async function createAdminClient() {
const client = new Client()
.setEndpoint(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT as string)
.setProject(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT as string)
.setKey(process.env.NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY as string);
return {
get account() {
return new Account(client);
}
};
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up Dub SDK">
Create the Dub client and send leads to Dub using the `dub.track.lead()` function.
```ts src/lib/server/dub.ts
import type { Models } from 'node-appwrite';
import { Dub } from 'dub';
const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.NEXT_DUB_API_KEY
});
export function addDubLead(user: Models.User<Models.Preferences>, dub_id: string) {
dub.track.lead({
clickId: dub_id,
eventName: 'Sign Up',
externalId: user.$id,
customerName: user.name,
customerEmail: user.email
});
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Send leads to Dub on user signup">
In the `/auth` page, use the Appwrite Admin client to allow users to sign up. Post sign up, check if the `dub_id` cookie is present, send a lead event to Dub if found, and delete the `dub_id` cookie.
```tsx src/app/auth/page.tsx
import { ID } from 'node-appwrite';
import { createAdminClient, getLoggedInUser } from '@/lib/server/appwrite';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { addDubLead } from '@/lib/server/dub';
async function signUpWithEmail(formData: any) {
'use server';
// Get sign up info from form
const email = formData.get('email');
const password = formData.get('password');
const name = formData.get('name');
// Create account and session using Appwrite
const { account } = await createAdminClient();
const user = await account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);
const session = await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
(await cookies()).set('my-custom-session', session.secret, {
path: '/',
httpOnly: true,
sameSite: 'strict',
secure: true
});
// Check if Dub ID is present in cookies and track lead if found
const dub_id = (await cookies()).get('dub_id')?.value;
if (dub_id) {
addDubLead(user, dub_id);
(await cookies()).delete('dub_id');
}
// Redirect to success page
redirect('/auth/success');
}
export default async function SignUpPage() {
// Verify active user session and redirect to success page if found
const user = await getLoggedInUser();
if (user) redirect('/auth/success');
return (
<>
<form action={signUpWithEmail}>
<input id="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" type="email" required />
<input id="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" minLength={8} type="password" required />
<input id="name" name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text" required />
<button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
</>
);
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>
Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:
| Property         | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`        | **Yes**  | The unique `dub_id` parameter that the lead conversion event is attributed to.                                           |
| `eventName`      | **Yes**  | The name of the event. Example: "Sign up".                                                                               |
| `externalId`     | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer. |
| `customerEmail`  | No       | The email address of the customer. If not passed, a random email address will be generated.                              |
| `customerName`   | No       | The name of the customer. If not passed, a random name will be generated (e.g. "Big Red Caribou").                       |
| `customerAvatar` | No       | The avatar URL of the customer. If not passed, a random avatar URL will be generated.                                    |

</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application that uses Auth0 for user authentication.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
## Configure Auth0
Next, configure Auth0 to track lead conversion events.
Here's how it works in a nutshell:
1. In the sign in `afterCallback` function, check if the user is a new sign up.
2. If the user is a new sign up, check if the `dub_id` cookie is present.
3. If the `dub_id` cookie is present, send a lead event to Dub using `dub.track.lead`
4. Delete the `dub_id` cookie.
```typescript app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.js
import { handleAuth, handleCallback, type Session } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";
const afterCallback = async (req: Request, session: Session) => {
const userExists = await getUser(session.user.email);
if (!userExists) {
createUser(session.user);
// check if dub_id cookie is present
const clickId = cookies().get("dub_id")?.value;
if (clickId) {
// send lead event to Dub
await dub.track.lead({
clickId,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: session.user.id,
customerName: session.user.name,
customerEmail: session.user.email,
customerAvatar: session.user.image,
});
// delete the dub_id cookie
cookies().set("dub_id", "", {
expires: new Date(0),
});
}
return session;
}
};
export default handleAuth({
callback: handleCallback({ afterCallback }),
});
```
Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:
| Property         | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`        | **Yes**  | The unique `dub_id` parameter that the lead conversion event is attributed to.                                           |
| `eventName`      | **Yes**  | The name of the event. Example: "Sign up".                                                                               |
| `externalId`     | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer. |
| `customerEmail`  | No       | The email address of the customer. If not passed, a random email address will be generated.                              |
| `customerName`   | No       | The name of the customer. If not passed, a random name will be generated (e.g. "Big Red Caribou").                       |
| `customerAvatar` | No       | The avatar URL of the customer. If not passed, a random avatar URL will be generated.                                    |

Learn how to track lead conversion events with Clerk and Dub
When it comes to conversion tracking, a `lead` event happens when a user performs an action that indicates interest in your product or service. This could be anything from:
* Signing up for an account
* Adding a product to cart
* Joining a mailing list
<Frame>
<img className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-lead-event.png" alt="A diagram showing how lead events are tracked in the conversion funnel" />
</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application that uses Clerk for user authentication.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
## Configure Clerk
Next, configure Clerk to track lead conversion events when a new user signs up. Here's a quick video showing how to do this:
<iframe width="100%" height="469px" className="rounded-xl" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/7338589f0c0c4ee1b71c9f2aa28aac87?sid=04c67f3b-1bec-468a-b0c7-5b24d24cd96e" title="Loom video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
Here's a quick summary of the steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Add environment variables">
Add the following environment variables to your app:
```bash
# get it here: https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/new
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
# get it here: https://d.to/tokens
DUB_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
</Step>
<Step title="Add a custom claim to your Clerk session token">
Add the following JSON as a [custom claim](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/add-onboarding-flow#add-custom-claims-to-your-session-token) to your Clerk session token:
```json Clerk Session Token
{
"metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Extend the `@dub/analytics` package with Clerk's `useUser` hook">
Extend the [`@dub/analytics` package](/sdks/client-side/introduction) to include a `trackLead` server action.
```tsx components/dub-analytics.tsx
"use client";
import { trackLead } from "@/actions/track-lead";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { Analytics, AnalyticsProps } from "@dub/analytics/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";
export function DubAnalytics(props: AnalyticsProps) {
const { user } = useUser();
useEffect(() => {
if (!user || user.publicMetadata.dubClickId) return;
// if the user is loaded but hasn't been persisted to Dub yet, track the lead event
trackLead({
id: user.id,
name: user.fullName!,
email: user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress,
avatar: user.imageUrl,
}).then(async (res) => {
if (res.ok) await user.reload();
else console.error(res.error);
});
// you can also use an API route instead of a server action
/*
fetch("/api/track-lead", {
method: "POST",
body: JSON.stringify({
id: user.id,
name: user.fullName,
email: user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress,
avatar: user.imageUrl,
}),
}).then(res => {
if (res.ok) await user.reload();
else console.error(res.statusText);
});
*/
}, [user]);
return <Analytics {...props} />;
}
```
Then, add the `DubAnalytics` component to your app's root layout component:
```tsx app/layout.tsx
import { DubAnalytics } from "@/components/dub-analytics";
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
return (
<html>
<body>
<DubAnalytics />
{children}
</body>
</html>
);
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Implement the `trackLead` server action">
On the server side, implement the `trackLead` server action. Alternatively, you can also create an API route instead:
<CodeGroup>
```tsx /actions/track-lead.ts
// This is a server action
"use server";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";
import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
export async function trackLead({
id,
name,
email,
avatar,
}: {
id: string;
name?: string | null;
email?: string | null;
avatar?: string | null;
}) {
try {
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const dubId = cookieStore.get("dub_id")?.value;
if (dubId) {
// Send lead event to Dub
await dub.track.lead({
clickId: dubId,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: id,
customerName: name,
customerEmail: email,
customerAvatar: avatar,
});
// Delete the dub_id cookie
cookieStore.set("dub_id", "", {
expires: new Date(0),
});
}
const clerk = await clerkClient();
await clerk.users.updateUser(id, {
publicMetadata: {
dubClickId: dubId || "n/a",
},
});
return { ok: true };
} catch (error) {
console.error("Error in trackLead:", error);
return { ok: false, error: (error as Error).message };
}
}
```
```tsx /api/track-lead/route.ts
// This is an API route
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
// read dub_id from the request cookies
const dubId = req.cookies.get("dub_id")?.value;
if (dubId) {
// Send lead event to Dub
await dub.track.lead({
clickId: dubId,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: id,
customerName: name,
customerEmail: email,
customerAvatar: avatar,
});
}
const clerk = await clerkClient();
await clerk.users.updateUser(id, {
publicMetadata: {
dubClickId: dubId || "n/a",
},
});
const res = NextResponse.json({ ok: true });
// Delete the dub_id cookie
res.cookies.set("dub_id", "", {
expires: new Date(0),
});
return res;
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>
Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:
| Property         | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`        | **Yes**  | The unique `dub_id` parameter that the lead conversion event is attributed to.                                           |
| `eventName`      | **Yes**  | The name of the event. Example: "Sign up".                                                                               |
| `externalId`     | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer. |
| `customerEmail`  | No       | The email address of the customer. If not passed, a random email address will be generated.                              |
| `customerName`   | No       | The name of the customer. If not passed, a random name will be generated (e.g. "Big Red Caribou").                       |
| `customerAvatar` | No       | The avatar URL of the customer. If not passed, a random avatar URL will be generated.                                    |

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application as lead events on Dub.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
## Configure lead tracking
Depending on which authentication framework you're using, we have a few pre-built guides to help you track lead events when a new user signs up for your SaaS application:

</Card>
</CardGroup>
If you're not using any of the frameworks listed above, you can use the following steps to track lead events:
1. Within the sign-up API request, retrieve the `dub_id` cookie that was created by the [`@dub/analytics` client-SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).
2. Send an event to the Dub API with the `dub_id` value, as well as your customer's ID and any other relevant information (email, name, avatar, etc.)
<Tip>
If you don't have a customer ID, you can also use the `email` or `phone` as
the customer ID.
</Tip>
## Code examples
Here are some examples of how you can track lead events using our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview):
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { Dub } from "dub";
const dub = new Dub();
const dubId = req.cookies["dub_id"];
if (dubId) {
await dub.track.lead({
clickId: dubId,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: customer.id,
customerName: customer.name,
customerEmail: customer.email,
customerAvatar: customer.avatar,
});
// delete the dub_id cookie
res.cookies.set("dub_id", "", {
expires: new Date(0),
});
}
```
```python Python
from dub import Dub
import os
dub = Dub(token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'])
dub_id = request.cookies.get('dub_id')
if dub_id:
dub.track.lead({
'click_id': dub_id,
'event_name': 'Sign Up',
'external_id': customer.id,
'customer_name': customer.name,
'customer_email': customer.email,
'customer_avatar': customer.avatar
})
# delete the dub_id cookie
response.delete_cookie('dub_id')
```
```go Go
package main
import (
"context"
dub "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
"net/http"
)
d := dub.New(
dub.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),

Value:   "",
Expires: time.Unix(0, 0),
})
}
```

$request->externalId = $customer->id;
$request->customerName = $customer->name;
$request->customerEmail = $customer->email;
$request->customerAvatar = $customer->avatar;
$dub->track->lead($request);
// delete the dub_id cookie

Learn how to track lead conversion events with NextAuth.js and Dub

</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application that uses NextAuth.js for user authentication.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
## Configure NextAuth.js Options
Then, set up your NextAuth.js configuration options to track lead conversion events using the `dub` TypeScript SDK.
Here's how it works in a nutshell:
1. Use NextAuth's [`signIn` event](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/events#signin) to detect when there's a new sign up.
2. If the user is a new sign up, check if the `dub_id` cookie is present.
3. If the `dub_id` cookie is present, send a lead event to Dub using `dub.track.lead`
4. Delete the `dub_id` cookie.
Under the hood, Dub records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from. The user's unique ID is now the source of truth for all future events – hence why we don't need the `dub_id` cookie anymore.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript App Router
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts
import type { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
...otherAuthOptions, // your other NextAuth options
events: {
async signIn(message) {
// if it's a new sign up
if (message.isNewUser) {
// check if dub_id cookie is present
const dub_id = cookies().get("dub_id")?.value;
if (dub_id) {
// send lead event to Dub
await dub.track.lead({
clickId: dub_id,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: user.id,
customerName: user.name,
customerEmail: user.email,
customerAvatar: user.image,
});
// delete the dub_id cookie
cookies().set("dub_id", "", {
expires: new Date(0),
});
}
}
},
},
};
```
```typescript Pages Router
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts
import type { NextApiRequest } from "next";
import type { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";
export const getOptions = (req: NextApiRequest): NextAuthOptions => ({
...otherAuthOptions, // your other NextAuth options
events: {
async signIn(message) {
// if it's a new sign up
if (message.isNewUser) {
// check if dub_id cookie is present
const { dub_id } = req.cookies;
if (dub_id) {
// send lead event to Dub
await dub.track.lead({
clickId: dub_id,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: user.id,
customerName: user.name,
customerEmail: user.email,
customerAvatar: user.image,
});
}
}
},
},
});
```
</CodeGroup>
Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:
| Property         | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`        | **Yes**  | The unique `dub_id` parameter that the lead conversion event is attributed to.                                           |
| `eventName`      | **Yes**  | The name of the event. Example: "Sign up".                                                                               |
| `externalId`     | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer. |
| `customerEmail`  | No       | The email address of the customer. If not passed, a random email address will be generated.                              |
| `customerName`   | No       | The name of the customer. If not passed, a random name will be generated (e.g. "Big Red Caribou").                       |
| `customerAvatar` | No       | The avatar URL of the customer. If not passed, a random avatar URL will be generated.                                    |
## Create a NextAuth.js Route Handler
Finally, import the `authOptions` variable you created earlier and use `NextAuth` to create a handler for your NextAuth.js routes.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript App Router
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/index.ts
import { authOptions } from "./options";
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);
export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```
```typescript Pages Router
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/index.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import { getOptions } from "./options";
const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) =>
NextAuth(req, res, getOptions(req));
export default handler;
```
</CodeGroup>

Learn how to track lead conversion events with Supabase and Dub
When it comes to conversion tracking, a `lead` event happens when a user performs an action that indicates interest in your product or service. This could be anything from:
* Signing up for an account
* Adding a product to cart
* Joining a mailing list
<Frame>
<img className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-lead-event.png" alt="A diagram showing how lead events are tracked in the conversion funnel" />
</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application that uses Supabase for user authentication.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
## Configure Supabase
Next, configure Supabase to track lead conversion events in the auth callback function.
Here's how it works in a nutshell:
1. In the `/api/auth/callback` route, check if:
* the `dub_id` cookie is present.
* the user is a new sign up (created in the last 10 minutes).
2. If the `dub_id` cookie is present and the user is a new sign up, send a lead event to Dub using `dub.track.lead`
3. Delete the `dub_id` cookie.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript Next.js App Router
// app/api/auth/callback/route.ts
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { waitUntil } from "@vercel/functions";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";
export async function GET(request: Request) {
const { searchParams, origin } = new URL(request.url);
const code = searchParams.get("code");
// if "next" is in param, use it as the redirect URL
const next = searchParams.get("next") ?? "/";
if (code) {
const supabase = createClient(cookies());
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code);
if (!error) {
const { user } = data;
const dub_id = cookies().get("dub_id")?.value;
// if the user is created in the last 10 minutes, consider them new
const isNewUser =
new Date(user.created_at) > new Date(Date.now() - 10 * 60 * 1000);
// if the user is new and has a dub_id cookie, track the lead
if (dub_id && isNewUser) {
waitUntil(
dub.track.lead({
clickId: dub_id,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: user.id,
customerName: user.user_metadata.name,
customerEmail: user.email,
customerAvatar: user.user_metadata.avatar_url,
})
);
// delete the clickId cookie
cookies().delete("dub_id");
}
return NextResponse.redirect(`${origin}${next}`);
}
}
// return the user to an error page with instructions
return NextResponse.redirect(`${origin}/auth/auth-code-error`);
}
```
```typescript Next.js Pages Router
// pages/api/auth/callback.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";
export default async function handler(
req: NextApiRequest,
res: NextApiResponse
) {
const { code, next = "/" } = req.query;
const origin = `${req.headers["x-forwarded-proto"]}://${req.headers.host}`;
if (typeof code === "string") {
const supabase = createClient(
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code);
if (!error) {
const { user } = data;
const { dub_id } = req.cookies;
// if the user is created in the last 10 minutes, consider them new
const isNewUser =
new Date(user.created_at) > new Date(Date.now() - 10 * 60 * 1000);
// if the user is new and has a dub_id cookie, track the lead
if (dub_id && isNewUser) {
dub.track
.lead({
clickId: dub_id,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: user.id,
customerName: user.user_metadata.name,
customerEmail: user.email,
customerAvatar: user.user_metadata.avatar_url,
})
.catch(console.error); // Handle any errors in tracking
// delete the clickId cookie
res.setHeader(
"Set-Cookie",
`dub_id=; Path=/; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT`
);
}
return res.redirect(`${origin}${next}`);
}
}
// return the user to an error page with instructions
return res.redirect(`${origin}/auth/auth-code-error`);
}
```
</CodeGroup>
Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:
| Property         | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`        | **Yes**  | The unique `dub_id` parameter that the lead conversion event is attributed to.                                           |
| `eventName`      | **Yes**  | The name of the event. Example: "Sign up".                                                                               |
| `externalId`     | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer. |
| `customerEmail`  | No       | The email address of the customer. If not passed, a random email address will be generated.                              |
| `customerName`   | No       | The name of the customer. If not passed, a random name will be generated (e.g. "Big Red Caribou").                       |
| `customerAvatar` | No       | The avatar URL of the customer. If not passed, a random avatar URL will be generated.                                    |

<Note>
Dub Conversions require a [Business plan](https://d.to/business) subscription
or higher.
</Note>
[Dub Conversions](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions) is a powerful tool that lets you turn any [short link you create on Dub](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link) into a full attribution engine. This allows you to understand how well your links are translating to actual users and revenue dollars.
Learn more about [how Dub Conversions works](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions).
<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.dub.co/blog/introducing-dub-conversions.webp" alt="Conversion analytics" />
</Frame>
In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Dub Conversions:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-2-install-the-dub-analytics-client-side-sdk)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
4. [Start sending events](#step-4-start-sending-events)
5. [View your conversions](#step-5-view-your-conversions)
## Step 1: Enable conversion tracking for your links
First, you'll need to enable conversion tracking for your Dub links to be able to start tracking conversions.
There are a few ways to do this:
1. [On a workspace-level](#option-1-on-a-workspace-level)
2. [On a link-level](#option-2-on-a-link-level)
3. [Via the API](#option-3-via-the-api)
### Option 1: On a workspace-level
To enable conversion tracking for all future links in a workspace, you can do the following:
1. Navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics).
2. Toggle the **Workspace-level Conversion Tracking** switch to enable conversion tracking for the workspace.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/enable-conversion-tracking-workspace.png" alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a workspace" />
</Frame>
This option will enable conversion tracking in the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for all future links.
### Option 2: On a link-level
If you don't want to enable conversion tracking for all your links in a workspace, you can also opt to enable it on a link-level.
To enable conversion tracking for a specific link, open the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) for a link and toggle the **Conversion Tracking** switch.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/enable-conversion-tracking.png" alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a link" />
</Frame>
<Tip>
You can also use the `C` keyboard shortcut when inside the link builder to
quickly enable conversion tracking for a given link.
</Tip>
### Option 3: Via the API
Alternatively, you can also enable conversion tracking programmatically via the [Dub API](/api-reference/introduction). All you need to do is pass `trackConversion: true` when creating or updating a link:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const link = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://dub.co",
trackConversion: true,
});
```
```python Python
link = d.links.create(url="https://dub.co", track_conversion=True)
```
```go Go
link, err := d.Links.Create(ctx, &dub.CreateLinkRequest{
URL: "https://dub.co",
TrackConversion: true,
})
```
```ruby Ruby
s.links.create_many(
::OpenApiSDK::Operations::CreateLinkRequest.new(
url: "https://dub.co",
track_conversion: true,
)
)
```
</CodeGroup>
## Step 2: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK
Next, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).
This will handle the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.
<Frame>

## Step 3: Install the Dub server-side SDK
<Tip>
If you are using Shopify, you can skip this step since our Shopify app will
automatically track conversions for you. Read the [Shopify integration
guide](/sdks/client-side/installation-guides/shopify) for more information.
</Tip>
Dub Conversions uses server-side event tracking to track conversions. Depending on which framework you're using, you can use our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview):
<CardGroup>
<Card title="TypeScript" icon="npm" href="/sdks/typescript/overview" horizontal>
TypeScript library for the Dub API
</Card>
<Card title="Go" icon="golang" href="/sdks/quickstart/go" iconType="brands" horizontal>

Python library for the Dub API
</Card>
<Card title="Ruby" icon="gem" href="/sdks/quickstart/ruby" horizontal>
Ruby library for the Dub API
</Card>
</CardGroup>
If you're using a framework that isn't listed, you can use the Dub REST API to track events on the server-side:
* [Tracking a lead event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-lead)
* [Tracking a sale event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale)
## Step 4: Start sending events
<Tip>
If you are using Shopify, you can skip this step since our Shopify app will
automatically track conversions for you. Read the [Shopify integration
guide](/sdks/client-side/installation-guides/shopify) for more information.
</Tip>
Now that you've installed the SDKs, you can start sending events to Dub. Since click events are tracked automatically, you'll only need to send events for the following cases:
* [Lead events](#step-4a-sending-lead-events)
* [Sale events](#step-4b-sending-sale-events)
### Step 4a: Sending Lead Events
The first event you'll want to send is a `lead` event. This happens when a user performs an action that indicates interest in your product or service. This could be anything from:
* Signing up for an account
* Adding a product to cart
* Joining a mailing list
<Frame>
<img className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-lead-event.png" alt="A diagram showing how lead events are tracked in the conversion funnel" />
</Frame>
Our most common lead event is `Sign Up`, which happens when a user signs up for an account. Depending on which authentication framework you're using, here are a few examples of how to send `Sign Up` lead events:
<CardGroup>
<Card title="NextAuth.js" icon="shield-halved" iconType="solid" href="/conversions/leads/next-auth" horizontal>

</Card>
<Card title="Appwrite" icon="shield-halved" iconType="solid" href="/conversions/leads/appwrite" horizontal>
Tracking lead events with Appwrite
</Card>
</CardGroup>
<Tip>
If you're using the [Remix framework](https://remix.run/), you might run into an [issue](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/7922) where you get an empty/null value for the `dub_id` cookie. In that case, try using a library like [`cookie`](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie) instead:
```typescript
import cookie from "cookie";
const cookies = cookie.parse(request.headers.get("cookie") ?? "");
const dubId = cookies.dub_id;
```
</Tip>
Here's the full list of attributes you can pass when sending a lead event:
| Property         | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickId`        | **Yes**  | The unique `dub_id` parameter that the lead conversion event is attributed to.                                           |
| `eventName`      | **Yes**  | The name of the event. Example: "Sign up".                                                                               |
| `externalId`     | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer. |
| `customerEmail`  | No       | The email address of the customer. If not passed, a random email address will be generated.                              |
| `customerName`   | No       | The name of the customer. If not passed, a random name will be generated (e.g. "Big Red Caribou").                       |
| `customerAvatar` | No       | The avatar URL of the customer. If not passed, a random avatar URL will be generated.                                    |
The lead event will serve as the source of truth for the customer's identity and which link they came from. This means that all subsequent actions performed by the customer (e.g. upgrading their plan, purchasing a product) will automatically be attributed to the original link.
### Step 4b: Sending Sale Events
The second event you'll want to send is a `sale` event. This happens when a user purchases your product or service. This could be anything from:
* Subscribing to a paid plan
* Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
* Purchasing a product
<Frame>
<img className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-sale-event.png" alt="A diagram showing how sale events are tracked in the conversion funnel" />
</Frame>
Depending on which payment processor you're using, we offer native integrations for the following:
<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Stripe" icon="stripe" href="/conversions/sales/stripe" horizontal>
Tracking sale conversion events with Stripe and the Dub SDK
</Card>
<Card title="Shopify" icon="shopify" href="/conversions/sales/shopify" horizontal>

</Card>
</CardGroup>
Alternatively, you can also send sale events manually using [our SDKs](/sdks/overview) or the [`POST /track/sale` API endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale).
Here are the properties you can include when sending a sale event:
| Property           | Required | Description                                                                                                                      |
| :----------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `externalId`       | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer.         |
| `amount`           | **Yes**  | The amount of the sale in cents.                                                                                                 |
| `paymentProcessor` | **Yes**  | The payment processor that processed the sale. (E.g. [Stripe](/conversions/sales/stripe), [Shopify](/conversions/sales/shopify)) |
| `eventName`        | No       | The name of the event. Defaults to "Purchase".                                                                                   |
| `invoiceId`        | No       | The invoice ID of the sale. Can be used as a idempotency key – only one sale event can be recorded for a given invoice ID.       |
| `currency`         | No       | The currency of the sale. Defaults to "usd".                                                                                     |
| `metadata`         | No       | An object containing additional information about the sale.                                                                      |
## Step 5: View your conversions
Once you've enabled conversion tracking for your links, all your tracked conversions will show up on your [Analytics dashboard](https://app.dub.co/analytics). We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:
* **Time-series**: A [time-series view](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics#1-time-series-analytics-chart) of the number clicks, leads and sales.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/timeseries-chart.png" alt="Time-series line chart" />

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sales conversion events with Dub.
## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to get Dub Conversions set up for your links:
1. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
2. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
3. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
Then, depending on your authentication provider, follow the relevant guide to set up lead conversion tracking:

## Step 1: Configure sale tracking
Next, depending on which payment processor you're using, you can leverage our native integrations to track sale events:
<CardGroup cols={1}>

</Card>
</CardGroup>
If you're not using any of the providers listed above, you can also manually track sale events using our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview) within your backend code:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { Dub } from "dub";
const dub = new Dub();
await dub.track.sale({
externalId: "cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA",
amount: 100,
paymentProcessor: "stripe",
eventName: "E-book purchase",
invoiceId: "123456",
currency: "usd",
});
```
```python Python
from dub import Dub
import os
dub = Dub(token=os.environ['DUB_API_KEY'])
dub.track.sale({
'external_id': 'cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA',
'amount': 100,
'payment_processor': 'stripe',
'event_name': 'E-book purchase',
'invoice_id': '123456',
'currency': 'usd'
})
```
```go Go
package main
import (
"context"
dub "github.com/dubinc/dub-go"
)
d := dub.New(
dub.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("DUB_API_KEY")),
)
_, err := d.Track.Sale(context.Background(), &operations.TrackSaleRequest{
ExternalId:       "cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA",
Amount:          100,
PaymentProcessor: "stripe",
EventName:       "E-book purchase",
InvoiceId:       "123456",
Currency:        "usd",
})
```
```ruby Ruby
require 'dub'
dub = ::OpenApiSDK::Dub.new
dub.config_security(
::OpenApiSDK::Shared::Security.new(
token: ENV['DUB_API_KEY']
)
)
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::TrackSaleRequest.new(
external_id: 'cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA',
amount: 100,
payment_processor: 'stripe',
event_name: 'E-book purchase',
invoice_id: '123456',
currency: 'usd'
)
dub.track.sale(req)
```
```php PHP
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Dub\Dub;
use Dub\Models\Operations;
$dub = Dub::builder()->setSecurity($_ENV["DUB_API_KEY"])->build();
$request = new Operations\TrackSaleRequest();
$request->externalId = 'cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA';
$request->amount = 100;
$request->paymentProcessor = 'stripe';
$request->eventName = 'E-book purchase';
$request->invoiceId = '123456';
$request->currency = 'usd';
$dub->track->sale($request);
```
</CodeGroup>
Here are the properties you can include when sending a sale event:
| Property           | Required | Description                                                                                                                      |
| :----------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `externalId`       | **Yes**  | The unique ID of the customer in your system. Will be used to identify and attribute all future events to this customer.         |
| `amount`           | **Yes**  | The amount of the sale in cents.                                                                                                 |
| `paymentProcessor` | **Yes**  | The payment processor that processed the sale. (E.g. [Stripe](/conversions/sales/stripe), [Shopify](/conversions/sales/shopify)) |
| `eventName`        | No       | The name of the event. Defaults to "Purchase".                                                                                   |
| `invoiceId`        | No       | The invoice ID of the sale. Can be used as a idempotency key – only one sale event can be recorded for a given invoice ID.       |
| `currency`         | No       | The currency of the sale. Defaults to "usd".                                                                                     |
| `metadata`         | No       | An object containing additional information about the sale.                                                                      |
## Step 2: View conversion results
And that's it – you're all set! You can now sit back, relax, and watch your conversion revenue grow. We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:
* **Time-series**: A [time-series view](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics#1-time-series-analytics-chart) of the number clicks, leads and sales.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/timeseries-chart.png" alt="Time-series line chart" />
</Frame>
* **Funnel chart**: A funnel chart view visualizing the conversion & dropoff rates across the different steps in the conversion funnel (clicks → leads → sales).
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/funnel-chart.png" alt="Funnel chart view showing the conversion & dropoff rates from clicks → leads → sales" />
</Frame>
* **Real-time events stream**: A [real-time events stream](https://dub.co/help/article/real-time-events-stream) of every single conversion event that occurs across all your links in your workspace.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/events-table.png" alt="The Events Stream dashboard on Dub" />
</Frame>
## Currency conversion support
For simplicity, Dub records all sales in the default currency of your Dub workspace. This means that if you pass a different currency, it will be automatically converted to USD for reporting consistency – using the latest foreign exchange rates.
```typescript TypScript
await dub.track.sale({
externalId: "cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA",
amount: 15480, // this will be converted from PLN to USD
currency: "pln",
paymentProcessor: "stripe",
eventName: "Purchase",
});
```
<Note>
The default currency for all Dub workspaces is currently set to `USD`. We will
add the ability to customize that in the future.

</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sale events from Shopify by leveraging Dub's Shopify integration.
<iframe width="100%" height="469px" className="rounded-xl" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/936970b8db5b41488657fa92ffec384a?sid=04030975-6d7e-4126-8487-a1d9a3095efc" title="Loom video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
## Step 1: Enable conversion tracking for your links
First, you'll need to enable conversion tracking for your Dub links to be able to start tracking conversions.
There are a few ways to do this:
1. [On a workspace-level](/conversions/quickstart#option-1-on-a-workspace-level)
2. [On a link-level](/conversions/quickstart#option-2-on-a-link-level)
3. [Via the API](/conversions/quickstart#option-3-via-the-api)
## Step 2: Install the Dub Shopify app
<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Shopify app">
Install the [Dub Shopify App](https://d.to/shopify/app) from the App Store.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/shopify/shopify-app.png" alt="The connection status in the Dub Conversions app" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Connect Shopify to your Dub workspace">
After installation, you will be prompted to link one of your Dub workspaces to
the app. Select **Connect** to establish a connection between your
Shopify store and your Dub workspace.
You'll be redirected back to your Shopify store after this step and you'll see a list of the links in your Dub workspace:
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/shopify/shopify-links-table.png" alt="The list of links in your Dub workspace" />
</Frame>
With the Shopify app, you can also create [conversion-enabled links](/conversions//quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links) directly from your Shopify store:
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/shopify/shopify-create-link.png" alt="Create a conversion-enabled link from your Shopify store" />
</Frame>
If you want a more powerful link builder, you can also use the [Dub Link Builder](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-link-builder) to create conversion-enabled links.
</Step>
<Step title="Activate Dub Analytics Script">
After installing the Dub Shopify app, the Dub Analytics script is added as an app embed. However, it needs to be activated manually to ensure it is included in your current theme.
To activate the Dub Analytics script, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to your Shopify admin panel.
2. Go to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
3. Click on **Customize** for your current theme.
4. In the theme editor, select the **App embeds** tab.
5. Locate the **Analytics Script** for the Dub Shopify app and toggle it to activate.

</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
Dub’s Shopify integration will automatically forward the following events to Dub:
* `orders/paid`: This event is triggered when a customer completes a purchase on your Shopify store. It is utilized to track sales that originate from Dub links.
* `app/uninstalled`: This event occurs when the app is uninstalled from a store. It is used to remove the integration from your Dub workspace.
In addition to the above, we also subscribe to the mandatory compliance webhook topics that are required by Shopify.
</Tip>
## Step 3: View conversion results
And that's it – you're all set! You can now sit back, relax, and watch your conversion revenue grow. We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:

## Currency conversion support
For simplicity, Dub records all sales in the native currency of the Shopify store. For example, if you're using USD for your Shopify store, Dub will record all sales in USD – even if your customers are paying in a different currency.
```json orders/paid
// Shopify orders/paid event payload
// @see: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/webhooks?reference=toml#list-of-topics-orders/paid
{
...
"current_subtotal_price_set": {
"shop_money": {
"amount": "398.00", // this is the amount that Dub will record
"currency_code": "USD" // this is the currency of your Shopify store
},
"presentment_money": {
"amount": "572.25",
"currency_code": "CAD"
}
},

# Stripe
Source: https://dub.co/docs/conversions/sales/stripe
Learn how to track a sale conversion event with Stripe
When it comes to conversion tracking, a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:
* Subscribing to a paid plan
* Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
* Purchasing a product via [Stripe Payment Links](#option-1-using-stripe-payment-links)
<Frame>
<img className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100" src="https://assets.dub.co/help/conversion-sale-event.png" alt="A diagram showing how lead events are tracked in the conversion funnel" />
</Frame>
In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sale events with Stripe as the payment processor by leveraging Dub's Stripe integration.
## Installing the Dub Stripe integration
Dub comes with a powerful Stripe integration that automatically listens to payment events on Stripe and track them as sales on Dub.
Here's how you can install the Dub Stripe integration:
<Steps>
<Step title="Find Dub on the Stripe App Marketplace">
Navigate to the [Dub Stripe Integration](https://d.to/stripe/app) on the Stripe App Marketplace.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/stripe/stripe-app-marketplace.png" alt="The Dub: Conversions Analytics page on the Stripe App Marketplace" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Install the Stripe app">
On the top right, click on **Install app** to install the Dub Conversions app on your Stripe account.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/stripe/stripe-app-install.png" alt="The Stripe integration installation flow" />
</Frame>
<Tip>
Alternatively, you can also install the Stripe app in test mode first to test
your end-to-end flow without involving real money.
</Tip>
Once the app is installed, click on **Continue to app settings** to finish the installation.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/stripe/stripe-app-install-continue.png" alt="Continue to app settings" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Connect Stripe to your Dub workspace">
In the app settings page, click on **Connect workspace** to connect your Stripe account with your Dub workspace.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/stripe/stripe-app-connect-workspace.png" alt="Connect Stripe to Dub" />
</Frame>
This will redirect you to the [Dub OAuth flow](/integrations/quickstart), where you can select the Dub workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/stripe/select-dub-workspace.png" alt="Select the Dub workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account" />
</Frame>
Once you click on **Authorize**, you will be redirected back to the Dub app settings page on Stripe, where you should see that the integration is now installed.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/stripe/stripe-app-installed.png" alt="The Stripe integration is now installed" />
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
Once the integration is installed, Dub will automatically listen to the following events on Stripe and track them as sales on Dub:
* `customer.created`: When a new customer is created
* `customer.updated`: When a customer is updated
* `checkout.session.completed`: When a customer completes a checkout session
* `invoice.paid`: When an invoice is paid (for tracking recurring subscriptions)
* `charge.refunded`: When a charge is refunded (for tracking refunds and updating payout commissions for [Dub Partners](https://dub.partners))
## Tracking sales with the Dub Stripe integration
Depending on your setup, there are a few ways you can track sales with the Dub Stripe integration.
* [Option 1: Using Stripe Payment Links](#option-1-using-stripe-payment-links)
* [Option 2: Using Stripe Checkout (recommended)](#option-2-using-stripe-checkout-recommended)
* [Option 3: Using Stripe Customers](#option-3-using-stripe-customers)
### Option 1: Using Stripe Payment Links
<Tip>
For this option to work, you need to [install the Dub Stripe
integration](#installing-the-dub-stripe-integration) and [enable conversion
tracking for your
links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
first.
</Tip>
If you're using [Stripe Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), simply add a `?dub_client_reference_id=1` query parameter to your Stripe Payment Link when shortening it on Dub.
Then, when a user clicks on the shortened link, Dub will automatically append the unique click ID as the `client_reference_id` [query parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters) to the payment link.
<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/conversions-payment-links.jpg" alt="Stripe payment link with Dub click ID" />
</Frame>
Finally, when the user completes the checkout flow, Dub will automatically [track the sale event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale) and [update the customer's `externalId`](/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-customer) with their Stripe customer ID for future reference.
Alternatively, if you have a marketing site that you're redirecting your users to first, you can do this instead:
1. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction), which automatically detects the `dub_id` in the URL and stores it as a first-party cookie on your site.
2. Then, retrieve and append the `dub_id` value as the `client_reference_id` parameter to the payment links on your pricing page / CTA button (prefixed with `dub_id_`).
```
https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxxx?client_reference_id=dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What if I'm using Stripe Pricing Tables?">
If you're using [Stripe Pricing Tables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) – you'd want to pass the Dub click ID as a [`client-reference-id` attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#handle-fulfillment-with-the-stripe-api) instead:
<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<body>
<h1>We offer plans that help any business!</h1>
<!-- Paste your embed code script here. -->
<script async src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js"></script>
<stripe-pricing-table
pricing-table-id="{{PRICING_TABLE_ID}}"
publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
client-reference-id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
>
</stripe-pricing-table>
</body>
```
```jsx React
import * as React from "react";
function PricingPage() {
// Paste the stripe-pricing-table snippet in your React component
return (
<stripe-pricing-table
pricing-table-id="'{{PRICING_TABLE_ID}}'"
publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
client-reference-id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
></stripe-pricing-table>
);
}
export default PricingPage;
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I'm using Stripe's Checkout Sessions API?">
If you're using Stripe's [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) for a recurring subscription service, you might want to check out our [Stripe Checkout option](#option-2-using-stripe-checkout) instead.
If your setup doesn't involve a [lead event](/conversions/leads/introduction) and goes straight to the Stripe checkout flow (e.g. for one-time purchases), you can simply pass the Dub click ID (prefixed with `dub_id_`) as the [`client_reference_id` parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-client_reference_id) to enable conversion tracking with Dub.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
success_url: "https://example.com/success",
line_items: [
{
price: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
quantity: 2,
},
],
mode: "payment",
client_reference_id: "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});
```
```python Python
stripe.checkout.Session.create(
success_url="https://example.com/success",
line_items=[{"price": "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "quantity": 2}],
mode="payment",
client_reference_id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
)
```
```go Go
params := &stripe.CheckoutSessionParams{
SuccessURL: stripe.String("https://example.com/success"),
LineItems: []*stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
&stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
Price: stripe.String("price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
Quantity: stripe.Int64(2),
},
},
Mode: stripe.String(string(stripe.CheckoutSessionModePayment)),
ClientReferenceID: stripe.String("dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
};
result, err := session.New(params);
```
```php PHP
$stripe->checkout->sessions->create([
'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success',
'line_items' => [
[
'price' => 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
'quantity' => 2,
],
],
'mode' => 'payment',
'client_reference_id' => "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
]);
```
```ruby Ruby
Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
line_items: [
{
price: 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
quantity: 2,
},
],
mode: 'payment',
client_reference_id: "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
})
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
### Option 2: Using Stripe Checkout (recommended)
If you have a custom checkout flow that uses Stripe's `checkout.sessions.create` API, you'd want to associate the [Stripe customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) with the user's unique ID in your database (which we tracked in the [lead conversion tracking step](/conversions/leads/introduction)).
This will allow Dub to automatically listen for purchase events from Stripe and associate them with the original click event (and by extension, the link that the user came from).
<Accordion title="How does this work?">
Remember in the [lead conversion tracking guide](/conversions/leads/introduction), we passed the user's unique user ID along with the click event ID in the `dub.track.lead` call?
```typescript TypeScript
await dub.track.lead({
clickId,
eventName: "Sign Up",
externalId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
customerName: user.name,
customerEmail: user.email,
customerAvatar: user.image,
});
```
Under the hood, Dub records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from.
Then, when the user makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.
</Accordion>
First, you'll need to complete the following prerequisites:
1. [Install the Dub Stripe integration](#installing-the-dub-stripe-integration)
2. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
3. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
4. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-dub-server-side-sdk)
Then, when you [create a checkout session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create), pass your customer's unique user ID in your database as the `dubCustomerId` value in the `metadata` field.
```typescript TypeScript
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";
const user = {
id: "user_123",
email: "user@example.com",
teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};
const priceId = "price_xxxxxxxxx";
const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
customer_email: user.email,
success_url: "https://app.domain.com/success",
line_items: [{ price: priceId, quantity: 1 }],
mode: "subscription",
client_reference_id: user.teamId,
metadata: {
dubCustomerId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
},
});
```
This way, when the customer completes their checkout session, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.
### Option 3: Using Stripe Customers
Alternatively, if you don't use Stripe's [checkout session creation flow](#option-2-using-stripe-checkout), you can also pass the user ID and the click event ID (`dub_id`) in the [Stripe customer creation flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create).
First, you'll need to complete the following prerequisites:
1. [Install the Dub Stripe integration](#installing-the-dub-stripe-integration)
2. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
3. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
Then, when you [create a Stripe customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create), pass the user's unique user ID in your database as the `dubCustomerId` value in the `metadata` field.
```typescript TypeScript
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";
const user = {
id: "user_123",
email: "user@example.com",
teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};
const dub_id = req.headers.get("dub_id");
await stripe.customers.create({
email: user.email,
name: user.name,
metadata: {
dubCustomerId: user.id,
dubClickId: dub_id,
},
});
```
Alternatively, you can also pass the `dubCustomerId` and `dubClickId` values in the `metadata` field of the [Stripe customer update flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update):
```typescript TypeScript
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";
const user = {
id: "user_123",
email: "user@example.com",
teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};
const dub_id = req.headers.get("dub_id");
await stripe.customers.update(user.id, {
metadata: {
dubCustomerId: user.id,
dubClickId: dub_id,
},
});
```
This way, when the customer makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the purchase details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the original click event.
## Currency conversion support
If you're using [Stripe's Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing) feature, Dub will record the sale amount using the currency of your Stripe account:
```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
"id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
"object": "event",
"type": "checkout.session.completed",
"data": {
"object": {
"id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
"object": "checkout.session",
"currency": "cad",
"amount_subtotal": 2055,
"amount_total": 2055,
"currency_conversion": {
"amount_subtotal": 1500,
"amount_total": 1500, // this is the amount that Dub will record
"source_currency": "usd", // the currency of your Stripe account
"fx_rate": "1.37"
}
}
}
}
```
If you're not using Stripe Adaptive Pricing, Dub will record the sale amount in the default currency of your Dub workspace. This means that if you pass a different currency, it will be automatically converted to USD for reporting consistency – using the latest foreign exchange rates.
```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
"id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
"object": "event",
"type": "checkout.session.completed",
"data": {
"object": {
"id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
"object": "checkout.session",
"currency": "cad",
"amount_subtotal": 2055,
"amount_total": 2055 // this will be converted from CAD to USD
}
}
}
```
<Note>
The default currency for all Dub workspaces is currently set to `USD`. We will
add the ability to customize that in the future.
</Note>
## View conversion results
And that's it – you're all set! You can now sit back, relax, and watch your conversion revenue grow. We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:
* **Time-series**: A [time-series view](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics#1-time-series-analytics-chart) of the number clicks, leads and sales.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/conversions/timeseries-chart.png" alt="Time-series line chart" />
</Frame>
* **Funnel chart**: A funnel chart view visualizing the conversion & dropoff rates across the different steps in the conversion funnel (clicks → leads → sales).

# Data model
Source: https://dub.co/docs/data-model
A quick overview of how Dub is structured.
Whether you are using Dub's [API](/api-reference/introduction) or not, this page is a quick way to understand how Dub works.
Within Dub, all data belongs to a [**Workspace**](#workspace). Within a workspace, you have [Links](#links), [Domains](#domains), [Tags](#tags), and more.
## Workspace
[Workspaces](https://dub.co/help/article/what-is-a-workspace) is the defacto way of organizing your links and working with your team on Dub. You can think of a Dub workspace like a workspace on Slack or Discord – it's a shared space where you can [invite your team members](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-invite-teammates) to collaborate on links.
When interacting with Dub's API, you'll also need to create a [workspace API key](/api-reference/tokens) to authenticate your requests.

# Integrate with Dub
Source: https://dub.co/docs/integrations/quickstart
Learn how to set up Dub OAuth applications to authenticate users with OAuth 2.0.
Integrations allow you to extend the capabilities of Dub and seamlessly connect with third-party platforms and services.
In this guide, you will learn how to create and manage integrations on Dub, allowing you to incorporate Dub's link management infrastructure into your application.
## Integrating via OAuth 2.0 (recommended)
Dub supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, which is **recommended** if you build integrations extending Dub's functionality.
We recommend you use a OAuth client library to integrate the OAuth flow. You can find recommended libraries in a variety of programming languages [here](https://oauth.net/code/).
### Set up OAuth 2.0
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up OAuth 2.0 authentication with Dub.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create an OAuth2 application in Dub">
* Go to the [OAuth Apps tab](https://app.dub.co/settings/oauth-apps) in your workspace.
* Click on **Create OAuth App**.
* Fill in the required fields to create an OAuth2 application.
</Step>
<Step title="Redirect users to authorization URL">
When you want to authenticate a user, you need to redirect them to the Dub OAuth authorization URL.
```
GET https://app.dub.co/oauth/authorize
```
Parameters:
| Property        | Description                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`     | The client ID of your OAuth application.                                                                                          |
| `redirect_uri`  | The URL to redirect the user to after they authorize the application. Make sure this URL is registered in your OAuth application. |
| `response_type` | Expected response type. It should be `code`.                                                                                      |
| `scope`         | A space separated list of scopes that you want to request access to. Read more about scopes [here](#scopes).                      |
| `state`         | The state parameter to prevent against CSRF attacks. Read more about it [here](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/state-parameters) |
An example URL would look like this:
```
GET https://app.dub.co/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=SOME_SCOPE&state=SOME_STATE
```
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/oauth-consent.png" alt="OAuth consent screen" width="1468" height="249" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Exchange code for an access token">
The `code` parameter is returned in the query string when the user is redirected back to your application. You can exchange this code for an access token by making a POST request to the Dub OAuth token URL.
```
POST https://api.dub.co/oauth/token
```
<Warning>
The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
</Warning>
Parameters:
| Property        | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`          | The code you received when the user was redirected back to your application. |
| `client_id`     | The client ID of your OAuth application.                                     |
| `client_secret` | The client secret of your OAuth application.                                 |
| `redirect_uri`  | The same redirect URI you used in the authorization URL.                     |
| `grant_type`    | The grant type. It should be `authorization_code`.                           |
Response:
After a successful request, you will receive a JSON response with the access token.
```json
{
"access_token": "dub_access_token_ae8ebf6f97e6200d886ef48a5...",
"refresh_token": "7f5acfbe14bca0a20fe6e430ddb7bb494eed160bd...",
"token_type": "Bearer",
"expires_in": 7200,
"scope": "links.write tags.write domains.read"
}
```
We recommend using the [PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) flow for native desktop or mobile application or a single-page app (SPA) where the `client_secret` cannot be hidden.
With PKCE, the `client_secret` is **never sent to the authorization server**, preventing the `client_secret` from being leaked from the client application.
Instead of using the `client_secret`, you will need to generate a `code_verifier` and `code_challenge` and use them to exchange for an access token.
For example [Dub Raycast extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/dub) uses PKCE to authenticate users.
</Step>
<Step title="Make an API request with the access token">
Once you have obtained a valid access token, you can use it to make requests to the Dub API.
You can initialize [Dub SDK](http://localhost:3334/sdks/overview) with the access token.
Here is an example of how you can create a link using the [Dub TypeScript SDK](http://localhost:3334/sdks/typescript):
```javascript
import { Dub } from "dub";
const dub = new Dub({
token: <ACCESS_TOKEN>,
});
const link = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://google.com",
});
```
Or pass the access token in the header: `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`
```shell
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.dub.co/links \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh the access token">
Dub access tokens are short-lived, depending on the `expires_in` value. Dub will respond with `401 Unauthorized` if you try to use an expired access token.
To refresh the access token, you need to make a POST request to the Dub OAuth token URL with the `refresh_token` you obtained when exchanging the code for an `access_token`.
```
POST https://api.dub.co/oauth/token
```
<Warning>
The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
</Warning>
Parameters:
| Property        | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`     | The client ID of your OAuth application.                                     |
| `client_secret` | The client secret of your OAuth application.                                 |
| `grant_type`    | The grant type. It should be `refresh_token`.                                |
| `refresh_token` | The refresh token you received when exchanging the code for an access token. |
Response:
After a successful request, you will receive a JSON response with the new access token.
```json
{
"access_token": "dub_access_token_ae8ebf6f97e6200d886ef48a5...",
"refresh_token": "7f5acfbe14bca0a20fe6e430ddb7bb494eed160bd...",
"token_type": "Bearer",
"expires_in": 7200,
"scope": "links.write tags.write domains.read"
}
```
This will invalidate the old access token and refresh token.
</Step>
</Steps>
### Scopes
You can request access to specific scopes when redirecting users to the Dub OAuth authorization URL. Scopes are permissions that the user needs to grant to your application.
Dub supports the following scopes for OAuth 2.0:
| Scope              | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspaces.read`  | Read access to workspaces.                                          |
| `workspaces.write` | Write access to workspaces.                                         |
| `links.read`       | Read access to links.                                               |
| `links.write`      | Write access to links.                                              |
| `tags.read`        | Read access to tags.                                                |
| `tags.write`       | Write access to tags.                                               |
| `analytics.read`   | Read access to analytics.                                           |
| `domains.read`     | Read access to domains.                                             |
| `domains.write`    | Write access to domains.                                            |
| `user.read`        | Read access to user information. This scope is included by default. |

# Local Development
Source: https://dub.co/docs/local-development
A guide on how to run Dub's codebase locally.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/logo-background-gradient.png" alt="Dub Logo on a gradient background" width="1200" height="630" />
</Frame>
## Introduction
Dub's codebase is set up in a monorepo (via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/dubinc/dub).
Here's the monorepo structure:
```
apps
├── web
packages
├── cli
├── email
├── embeds
├── prisma
├── stripe-app
├── tailwind-config
├── tinybird
├── tsconfig
├── ui
├── utils
```
The `apps` directory contains the code for:
* `web`: The entirety of Dub's application ([app.dub.co](https://app.dub.co)) + our link redirect infrastructure.
The `packages` directory contains the code for:
* `cli`: A CLI for easily shortening URLs with the Dub API.
* `email`: Dub's email application with function to send emails and templates.
* `embeds`: A package used embed Dub's referral dashboard.
* `prisma`: Prisma Configuration for Dub's web-app.
* `stripe-app`: The Stripe app for dub conversions.
* `tailwind-config`: The Tailwind CSS configuration for Dub's web app.
* `tinybird`: Dub's Tinybird configuration.
* `tsconfig`: The TypeScript configuration for Dub's web app.
* `ui`: Dub's UI component library.
* `utils`: A collection of utility functions and constants used across Dub's codebase.
## How `app.dub.co` works
Dub's web app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
It also utilizes code from the `packages` directory, specifically the `@dub/ui` and `@dub/utils` packages.
All of the code for the web app is located in here: [`main`/apps/web/app/app.dub.co](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/main/apps/web/app/app.dub.co). This is using the Next.js [route group pattern](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups).
There's also the API server, which is located in here: [`main`/apps/web/app/api](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/main/apps/web/app/api)
When you run `pnpm dev` to start the development server, the app will be available at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). The reason we use `localhost:8888` and not `app.localhost:8888` is because Google OAuth doesn't allow you to use localhost subdomains.
## How link redirects work on Dub
Link redirects on Dub are powered by [Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware).
To handle high traffic, we use Redis to cache every link's metadata when it's first created. This allows us to serve redirects without hitting our MySQL database.
Here's the code that powers link redirects: [`main`/apps/web/lib/middleware/link.ts](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/blob/main/apps/web/lib/middleware/link.ts)
## Running Dub locally
To run Dub locally, you'll need to set up the following:
* A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
* An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
* A [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)-compatible MySQL database
Watch this video from our friends at Tinybird to learn how to set up Dub locally:
<iframe width="100%" className="aspect-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GNYcS9BHhc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
## Step 1: Local setup
First, you'll need to clone the Dub repo and install the dependencies.
<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repo">
First, clone the [Dub repo](https://d.to/github) into a public GitHub repository.
```bash Terminal
git clone https://github.com/dubinc/dub.git
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install dependencies">
Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```bash Terminal
pnpm i
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build internal packages">
Execute the command below to compile all internal packages:
```bash Terminal
pnpm -r --filter "./packages/**" build
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up environment variables">
Copy the `.env.example` file from `./apps/web` to `.env` by executing the following command from `apps/web`:
```bash Terminal
cp ./apps/web/.env.example .env
```
You'll be updating this `.env` file with your own values as you progress through the setup.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 2: Set up Tinybird Clickhouse database
Next, you'll need to set up the [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) Clickhouse database. This will be used to store time-series click events data.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Tinybird Workspace">
In your [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.
Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). Paste this token as the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.
<Tip>
Alternatively, you can set up a [local Tinybird container](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/cli/local-container) for local development.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Install Tinybird CLI and authenticate">
In your newly-cloned Dub repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.
If you have `brew`, install `pipx` by running `brew install pipx`. If not, you can check [installation guide](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) for other options. After that, install the Tinybird CLI with `pipx install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).
Run `tb auth --interactive` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.
</Step>
<Step title="Publish Tinybird datasource and endpoints">
Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):
```bash Terminal
$ tb push
** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
...
** Building dependencies
** Running 'click_events'
** 'click_events' created
** Running 'device'
** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
** => Test endpoint with:
** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
** 'device' created
...
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up Tinybird API base URL">
You will then need to update your [Tinybird API base URL](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/api-reference/api-reference.html#regions-and-endpoints) to match the region of your database.
From the previous step, take note of the **Test endpoint** URL. It should look something like this:
```bash Terminal
Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
```
Copy the base URL and paste it as the `TINYBIRD_API_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.
```bash Terminal
TINYBIRD_API_URL=https://api.us-east.tinybird.co
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 3: Set up Upstash Redis database
Next, you'll need to set up the [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis database. This will be used to cache link metadata and serve link redirects.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Upstash database">
In your [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/), create a new database.
For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.
<Frame>![Upstash Redis database](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/upstash-create-db.png)</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Set up Upstash Redis environment variables">
Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section into your `.env` file.
<Frame>![Upstash Redis tokens](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/upstash-redis-tokens.png)</Frame>
Navigate to the [QStash tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Request Builder** section into your `.env` file.
<Frame>![Upstash QStash tokens](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/upstash-qstash-tokens.png)</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Optional: Set up Ngrok tunnel">
If you're planning to run Qstash-powered background jobs locally, you'll need to set up an Ngrok tunnel to expose your local server to the internet.
Follow [these steps](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) to setup `ngrok`, and then run the following command to start an Ngrok tunnel at port `8888`:
```bash Terminal
ngrok http 8888
```
Copy the `https` URL and paste it as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_NGROK_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 4: Set up PlanetScale MySQL database
Next, you'll need to set up a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)-compatible MySQL database. This will be used to store user data and link metadata. There are two options:
### Option 1: Local MySQL database with PlanetScale simulator (recommended)
You can use a local MySQL database with a PlanetScale simulator. This is the recommended option for local development since it's 100% free.
Prerequisites:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
<Steps>
<Step title="Spin up the docker-compose stack">
In the terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to start the Docker Compose stack:
```bash Terminal
docker-compose up
```
This will start two containers: one for the MySQL database and another for the PlanetScale simulator.
</Step>
<Step title="Set up database environment variables">
Ensure the following credientials are added to your `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@localhost:3306/planetscale"
PLANETSCALE_DATABASE_URL="http://root:unused@localhost:3900/planetscale"
```
Here, we are using the open-source [PlanetScale simulator](https://github.com/mattrobenolt/ps-http-sim) so the application can continue to use the `@planetscale/database` SDK.
<Tip>
While we're using two different values in local development, in production or staging environments, you'll only need the `DATABASE_URL` value.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Prisma client and create database tables">
In the terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:
```bash Terminal
pnpm run prisma:generate
```
Then, create the database tables with the following command:
```bash Terminal
pnpm run prisma:push
```
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
The docker-compose setup includes Mailhog, which acts as a mock SMTP server
and shows received emails in a web UI. You can access the Mailhog web
interface at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025). This is useful
for testing email functionality without sending real emails during local
development.
</Tip>
### Option 2: PlanetScale hosted database
<Note>
PlanetScale recently [removed their free
tier](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever), so you'll need to pay
for this option. A cheaper alternative is to use a [MySQL database on
Railway](https://railway.app/template/mysql) (\$5/month).
</Note>
<Steps>
<Step title="Create PlanetScale database">
In your [PlanetScale account](https://app.planetscale.com/), create a new database.
Once your database is created, you'll be prompted to select your language or Framework. Select **Prisma**.
<Frame>
![PlanetScale choose framework](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/planetscale-choose-framework.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Set up PlanetScale environment variables">
Then, you'll have to create a new password for your database. Once the password is created, scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** section and copy the `DATABASE_URL` into your `.env` file.
<Frame>
![PlanetScale add credentials](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/planetscale-add-credentials.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Prisma client and create database tables">
In the terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:
```bash Terminal
pnpm run prisma:generate
```
Then, create the database tables with the following command:
```bash Terminal
pnpm run prisma:push
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 5: Set up Mailhog
To view emails sent from your application during local development, you'll need to set up [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog).
<Note>
If you've already run `docker compose up` as part of the database setup, you
can skip this step. Mailhog is included in the Docker Compose configuration
and should already be running.
</Note>
<Steps>
<Step title="Pull Mailhog Docker image">
Run the following command to pull the Mailhog Docker image:
```bash Terminal
docker pull mailhog/mailhog
```
</Step>
<Step title="Start Mailhog container">
Start the Mailhog container with the following command:
```bash Terminal
docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
```
This will run Mailhog in the background, and the web interface will be available at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 6: Set NextAuth secret
Generate a secret by visiting [https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32). Set the value of `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in `.env` to this value.
## Step 7: Start the development server
Finally, you can start the development server. This will build the packages + start the app servers.
```bash Terminal
pnpm dev
```
The web app (`apps/web`) will be available at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
### Testing your shortlinks locally
Use the following url structure to ensure event tracking is working, and to populate analytics data, replacing `<shortlink-key>`  with the shortlink key you've created.
```
http://dub.localhost:8888/<shortlink-key>
```

# Introduction
Source: https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side/introduction
Learn more about the @dub/analytics script and how to install it.
`@dub/analytics` is a lightweight (\~1kb), [open-source](https://github.com/dubinc/analytics) client-side script used for tracking conversions with [Dub Conversions](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-conversions).
The script handles the detection of the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

</Frame>
With the script, you can also [track clicks on the client-side](/conversions/clicks/introduction#client-side-click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.
## Installation guides
Based on the framework or platform you're using, you can install the script in different ways:

## Concepts
You can pass the following props to the `@dub/analytics` script to customize its behavior:
<ParamField body="data-api-host" type="url" default="https://api.dub.co">
The base URL for the Dub API. This is useful for [setting up reverse
proxies](/conversions/clicks/introduction#step-4-optional-but-recommended-set-up-a-reverse-proxy)
to avoid adblockers.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="data-attribution-model" type="first-click | last-click" default="last-click">
The attribution model to use for the analytics event. The following
attribution models are available:
* `first-click`: The first click model
gives all the credit to the first touchpoint in the customer journey.
* `last-click`: The last click model gives all the credit to the last
touchpoint in the customer journey.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="data-cookie-options" type="JSON-stringified object">
Custom properties to pass to the cookie. Refer to
[MDN's Set-Cookie documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) for
all available options.
<Expandable title="properties">
<ParamField body="domain" type="string">
Specifies the value for the `Domain` Set-Cookie attribute. This is useful
for cross-domain tracking. Example: `.example.com`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expires" type="integer" default="90">
Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the `Expires` Set-Cookie
attribute. Example: `new Date('2024-12-31')`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expiresInDays" type="integer" default="90">
Specifies the number (in days) to be the value for the `Expires`
Set-Cookie attribute.
For example, to set the cookie window to 60 days (instead of the default 90 days), you can add the following to your script:
```html
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
defer
data-cookie-options='{"expiresInDays": 60}'
/>
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="path" type="string" default="/">
Specifies the value for the `Path` Set-Cookie attribute. By default, the
path is considered the "default path". Example: `/`
</ParamField>
</Expandable>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="data-domains" type="JSON-stringified object">
Configure the domains that Dub will track. The following properties are available:
<Expandable title="properties">
<ParamField body="refer" type="string">
The Dub custom domain for [referral program client-side click tracking](http://d.to/clicks/refer) (previously `data-short-domain`).

</Expandable>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="data-short-domain" type="string" deprecated>
\[Deprecated: Use `data-domains.refer` instead] The Dub custom domain for
[referral program client-side click tracking](http://d.to/clicks/refer)
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="data-query-param" type="string" default="via">
The query parameter to listen to for client-side click-tracking (e.g.
`?via=abc123`).
</ParamField>
## Examples
Here are some code examples to learn how to use the script:
### Cross-domain tracking
By default, the script already sets the `dub_id` cookie on a **cross-domain level**.
This means that if you have the script installed on your marketing site (e.g. **example.com**), the cookie will also be accessible when your user signs up for your app (e.g. **app.example.com**).
However, if you are installing the script on a subdomain (e.g. **app.example.com**), you will need to set the following option to make sure the cookie is accessible on the apex domain as well (e.g. **example.com**):
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
<DubAnalytics
cookieOptions={{
domain: ".example.com",
}}
/>
```
```html Other
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
data-cookie-options='{"domain": ".example.com"}'
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
The script also supports conversion tracking across *entirely different domains*.
This means that if you have the script installed on a separate domain (e.g. **example.sh**), you can use the `outboundDomains` prop to ensure that the `dub_id` cookie value is automatically appended to all outbound links targeting your main domain (e.g. **example.com**).
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
// install this script on both domains
<DubAnalytics
domainsConfig={{
outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"],
}}
/>
```
```html Other
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.outbound-domains.js"
data-domains='{"outbound": ["example.com", "example.sh"]}'
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
<Tip>
For outbound-domains support, you'll need to use the
[`script.outbound-domains.js`](/sdks/client-side/variants#outbound-domains-variant-script-outbound-domains-js)
variant of the script. Learn more about [how script variants
work](/sdks/client-side/variants).
</Tip>
### Custom cookie window
By default, the script sets the `dub_id` cookie to expire in 90 days. You can customize this behavior by passing the `cookieOptions` prop to the script:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
<DubAnalytics
cookieOptions={{
expiresInDays: 60, // setting the cookie to expire in 60 days
}}
/>
```
```html Other
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
data-cookie-options='{"expiresInDays": 60}'
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
### Load the script via a reverse proxy
To avoid ad-blockers from blocking the `@dub/analytics` script, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy.
Depending on which backend framework you're using, there are a few different ways to do this:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Next.js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
async rewrites() {
return [
{
source: "/_proxy/dub/script.js",
destination: "https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js",
},
];
},
};
```
```json Vercel
// vercel.json
{
"rewrites": [
{
"source": "/_proxy/dub/script.js",
"destination": "https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"
}
]
}
```
</CodeGroup>
Once you've set up your reverse proxy, don't forget to update the `scriptProps.src` parameter in the `<Analytics />` component to point to your proxy URL.
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React/Next.js
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics/react";
export default function App() {
return (
<Layout>
<DubAnalytics
scriptProps={{
src: "/_proxy/dub/script.js", // pointing to your reverse proxy
}}
/>
{/* Your app code here */}
</Layout>
);
}
```
```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
src="/_proxy/dub/script.js" // pointing to your reverse proxy
defer
/>
```
</CodeGroup>

# Script Variants
Source: https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side/variants
Learn more about the different variants of the @dub/analytics script.
Inspired by [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), our script is split into multiple variants to help you optimize your script for different use cases.
This allows us to keep the base variant of the script as lightweight as possible (\~1kb) while still allowing you to use the script in more complex use cases.
## Syntax
The base script is available on [`script.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js), and all variants are available on `script.[variant].js`.
For instance, the `outbound-domains` variant is available on [`script.outbound-domains.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.outbound-domains.js).
You can also mix and match variants. For example, you can use the `site-visit` and `outbound-domains` variants together with this script: [`script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js).
## List of variants
Here's a list of all the variants available:
* [Base Variant](#base-variant-script-js)
* [Site Visit Variant](#site-visit-variant-script-site-visit-js)
* [Outbound Domains Variant](#outbound-domains-variant-script-outbound-domains-js)
* [Combined Variant](#combined-variant)
### Base Variant (`script.js`)
The base variant of the script is the most lightweight variant of the script. It supports the following features:
* Detecting the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie.
* Tracking [client-side click events for referral programs](/conversions/clicks/introduction#client-side-click-tracking).
* Setting [custom cookie window](/sdks/client-side/introduction#custom-cookie-window) and [attribution models](/sdks/client-side/introduction#param-data-attribution-model)
Here's how you can use the base variant:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
<DubAnalytics />
```
```html Other
<script src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js"></script>
```
</CodeGroup>
### Site Visit Variant (`script.site-visit.js`)
<Note>`@dub/analytics` site visit feature is still in beta.</Note>
The site visit variant of the script is a variant of the script that supports tracking site visits.
On top of the features supported by the base variant, it also supports tracking the first entry page of a user, which is useful for measuring SEO and Google Ads performance.
Here's how you can use the site visit variant:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
// the DubAnalytics component automatically detects the `domainsConfig.site` prop
// and applies the site-visit script variant for you
<DubAnalytics domainsConfig={{ site: "site.dub.co" }} />
```
```html Other
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.js"
data-domains='{"site": "site.dub.co"}'
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
### Outbound Domains Variant (`script.outbound-domains.js`)
The outbound domains variant of the script is a variant of the script that supports [cross-domain tracking](/sdks/client-side/introduction#cross-domain-tracking) across different applications.
On top of the features supported by the base variant, it also supports appending the `dub_id` cookie to all outbound links targeting the domains you configure.
Here's how you can use the outbound domains variant:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
// the DubAnalytics component automatically detects the `domainsConfig.outbound` prop
// and applies the outbound-domains script variant for you
<DubAnalytics domainsConfig={{ outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"] }} />
```
```html Other
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.outbound-domains.js"
data-domains='{"outbound": ["example.com", "example.sh"]}'
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
### Combined Variant
You can also mix and match variants. For example, you can use the `site-visit` and `outbound-domains` variants together with this script: [`script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js`](https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js).
Here's how you can use the combined variant:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
// the DubAnalytics component automatically detects the `domainsConfig` prop
// and applies the combined script variant for you
<DubAnalytics
domainsConfig={{
site: "site.dub.co",
outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"],
}}
/>
```
```html Other
<script
src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.site-visit.outbound-domains.js"
data-domains='{"site": "site.dub.co", "outbound": ["example.com", "example.sh"]}'
/>
```
</CodeGroup>
## `DubAnalytics` React Component
If you're using a React application, we recommend using the `DubAnalytics` component to automatically apply the correct script variant for you.
For example, if you want to use the `outbound-domains` variant, you can do the following:
```typescript React
<DubAnalytics domainsConfig={{ outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"] }} />
```
The `DubAnalytics` component will automatically detect the `domainsConfig` prop and apply the correct script variant for you.

</Accordion>
Optionally, you can also pass an `externalId` field which is a unique identifier for the link in your own database to associate it with the link in Dub's system.
```python views.py
def create_link(request):
res = d.links.create(request={
"url": "https://google.com",
"external_id": "12345",
})
return JsonResponse({
"short_link": res.short_link
})
```
This will let you easily [update the link](#5-update-link) or [retrieve analytics](#6-retrieve-analytics-for-link) for it later on using the `externalId` instead of the Dub `linkId`.
## 4. Upsert link
Dub Python SDK provides a method to upsert a link – where an existing link is updated if it exists, or a new link is created if it doesn't. so you don't have to worry about checking if the link already exists.
```python views.py
def upsert_link(request):
res = d.links.upsert(request={
"url": "https://google.com",
})
return JsonResponse({
"short_link": res.short_link
})
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub Python SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with `ext_`).
```python views.py
# Update a link by its linkId
def update_link(request):
res = d.links.update(link_id="clx1gvi9o0005hf5momm6f7hj", request_body={
"url": "https://google.uk",
})
return JsonResponse({
"short_link": res.short_link
})
# Update a link by its externalId
def update_link(request):
res = d.links.update(external_id="ext_12345", request_body={
"url": "https://google.uk",
})
return JsonResponse({
"short_link": res.short_link
})
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Dub allows you to retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub Python SDK.
```python views.py
# Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
def analytics(request):
res = d.analytics.retrieve(request={
"link_id": "clx1gvi9o0005hf5momm6f7hj",
"interval": "7d",
"group_by": "timeseries",
})
return JsonResponse(res)
```
Similarly, you can retrieve analytics for a link using the `externalId` field.
```python views.py
# Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
def analytics(request):
res = d.analytics.retrieve(request={
"external_id": "ext_12345",
"interval": "7d",
"group_by": "timeseries",
})
return JsonResponse(res)
```

Optionally, you can also pass an `externalId` field which is a unique identifier for the link in your own database to associate it with the link in Dub's system.
```typescript index.ts
app.post("/create-link", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
try {
const result = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://www.google.com",
externalId: "12345",
});
res.status(200).json(result);
} catch (error: any) {
res.status(400).json(error);
}
});
```
This will let you easily [update the link](#5-update-link) or [retrieve analytics](#6-retrieve-analytics-for-link) for it later on using the `externalId` instead of the Dub `linkId`.
## 4. Upsert link
Dub TypeScript SDK provides a method to upsert a link – where an existing link is updated if it exists, or a new link is created if it doesn't. so you don't have to worry about checking if the link already exists.
```typescript index.ts
app.post("/upsert-link", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
try {
// Update the link if same URL already exists or create a new link
const result = await dub.links.upsert({
url: "https://www.google.com",
});
res.status(200).json(result);
} catch (error: any) {
res.status(400).json(error);
}
});
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with `ext_`).
```typescript index.ts
app.post("/update-link", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
try {
// Update a link by its linkId
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.update(
"link_rWOKByP0bRMrstK8e4HPjprJ",
{
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
}
);
// Update a link by its externalId
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.update("ext_12345", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
res.status(200).json({ shortLink });
} catch (error: any) {
res.status(400).json(error);
}
});
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Dub allows you to retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
```typescript index.ts
import { ClicksTimeseries } from "dub/models/components";
app.get("/analytics", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
try {
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
linkId: "clv3o9p9q000au1h0mc7r6l63",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
res.status(200).json(timeseries);
} catch (error: any) {
res.status(400).json(error);
}
});
```
Similarly, you can retrieve analytics for a link using the `externalId` field.
```typescript index.ts
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
externalId: "ext_12345",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
```

# Laravel
Source: https://dub.co/docs/sdks/quickstart/laravel
Learn how to integrate Dub with Laravel.
## 1. Prerequisites
To follow this guide, you will need to:
* [Create a Dub account](https://d.to/try)
* [Create an API key](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens)
## 2. Install and initialize the Dub PHP SDK
<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Install">
To install the [Dub PHP SDK](https://dub.co/solutions/php), run the following command:
```bash
composer require dub/dub-php
```
</Step>
<Step title="Configuration">
In your `.env` file, add your Dub API key:
```bash
DUB_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
In your `config/services.php` file, add the following:
```php
'dub' => [
'api_key' => env('DUB_API_KEY'),
],
```
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize">
You can now create an instance of the `Dub` class and pass in your API key:
```php index.php
use Dub\Dub;
use Dub\Components\Security;
$dub = Dub::builder()->setSecurity(config('services.dub.api_key'))->build();
// create a link
$dub->links->create(...);
```
</Step>
<Step title="Service Container (Optional)">
If you want to be able to inject the `Dub` class via the service container, add this to the `register` method of your `AppServiceProvider.php`:
```php index.php
$this->app->bind(Dub::class, function ($app) {
return Dub::builder()->setSecurity($app['config']->get('services.dub.api_key'))->build();
});
```
You can then inject the authenticated `Dub` instance throughout your application:
```php index.php
use Dub\Laravel\Dub;
class LinkController extends Controller {
public function createLink(Dub $dub) {
// Now you can use the SDK instance
$dub->links->create(...);
}
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## 3. Create link
Let's create a short link using the Dub Laravel SDK.
```php index.php

}
}
}
```
This will let you easily [update the link](#5-update-link) or [retrieve analytics](#6-retrieve-analytics-for-link) for it later on using the `externalId` instead of the Dub `linkId`.
## 4. Upsert link
The Dub Laravel SDK provides a method to upsert a link – where an existing link is updated if it exists, or a new link is created if it doesn't.
```php index.php
use Dub\Models\Operations;
class LinkController extends Controller
{
public function upsertLink()
{
$dub = new Dub();
try {
$request = new Operations\UpsertLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://google.com'
);
$response = $dub->links->upsert($request);
if ($response->linkSchema !== null) {
// handle response
}
} catch (Throwable $e) {
// handle exception
}
}
}
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
To update an existing link using the Dub Laravel SDK, you can either use the link's `linkId` or `externalId`.
```php index.php
use Dub\Models\Operations;
class LinkController extends Controller
{
public function updateLink()
{
$dub = new Dub();
try {
$request = new Operations\UpdateLinkRequest();
$request->linkId = 'cly2p8onm000cym8200nfay7l';
$request->requestBody = new Operations\UpdateLinkRequestBody();
$request->requestBody->url = 'https://google.us';
$response = $dub->links->update($request);
if ($response->linkSchema !== null) {
echo $response->linkSchema->shortLink;
}
} catch (Throwable $e) {
// handle exception
}
}
}
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
You can also retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub Laravel SDK.
```php index.php
use Dub\Models\Operations;
class LinkController extends Controller
{
public function retrieveAnalytics()
{
$dub = new Dub();
try {
$request = new Operations\RetrieveAnalyticsRequest();
$request->linkId = 'clmnr6jcc0005l308q9v56uz1';
$request->interval = Operations\Interval::SevenD;
$request->groupBy = Operations\GroupBy::Timeseries;
$response = $dub->analytics->retrieve($request);
if ($response->oneOf !== null) {
// Handle the response
print_r($response->oneOf);
}
} catch (Throwable $e) {

```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with `ext_`).
```typescript app/api/links/route.ts
export async function PATCH() {
try {
// Update a link by its linkId
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.update(
"link_rWOKByP0bRMrstK8e4HPjprJ",
{
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
}
);
// Update a link by its externalId
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.update("ext_12345", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
return Response.json({ shortLink });
} catch (error) {
return Response.json({ error }, { status: 500 });
}
}
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Dub allows you to retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
```typescript app/api/analytics/route.ts
import { ClicksTimeseries } from "dub/models/components";
export async function GET() {
try {
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
linkId: "clv3o9p9q000au1h0mc7r6l63",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
return Response.json(timeseries);
} catch (error) {
return Response.json({ error }, { status: 500 });
}
}
```
Similarly, you can retrieve analytics for a link using the `externalId` field.
```typescript app/api/analytics/route.ts
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
externalId: "ext_12345",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];

} catch (Throwable $e) {
// handle exception
}
```
This will let you easily [update the link](#5-update-link) or [retrieve analytics](#6-retrieve-analytics-for-link) for it later on using the `externalId` instead of the Dub `linkId`.
## 4. Upsert link
Dub PHP SDK provides a method to upsert a link – where an existing link is updated if it exists, or a new link is created if it doesn't. so you don't have to worry about checking if the link already exists.
```php index.php
use Dub\Models\Operations;
try {
$request = new Operations\UpsertLinkRequestBody(
url: 'https://google.com',
);
$response = $dub->links->upsert($request);
if ($response->linkSchema !== null) {
// handle response
}
} catch (Throwable $e) {
// handle exception
}
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub PHP SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with ext\_).
```php index.php
use Dub\Models\Operations;
try {
$request = new Operations\UpdateLinkRequest();
$request->linkId = 'cly2p8onm000cym8200nfay7l';
$request->requestBody = new Operations\UpdateLinkRequestBody();
$request->requestBody->url = 'https://google.us';
$response = $dub->links->update($request);
if ($response->linkSchema !== null) {
echo $response->linkSchema->shortLink;
}
} catch (Throwable $e) {
// handle exception
}
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Let's retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub PHP SDK.
```php index.php
use Dub\Models\Operations;
try {
$request = new Operations\RetrieveAnalyticsRequest();
$request->linkId = 'clmnr6jcc0005l308q9v56uz1';
$request->interval = Operations\Interval::SevenD;
$request->groupBy = Operations\GroupBy::Timeseries;
$response = $dub->analytics->retrieve($request);
if ($response->oneOf !== null) {
// Handle the response
print_r($response->oneOf);
}
} catch (Throwable $e) {
// handle exception
}
```

Learn how to integrate Dub with Remix.
## 1. Prerequisites
To follow this guide, you will need to:
* [Create a Dub account](https://d.to/try)
* [Create an API key](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens)
## 2. Install and initialize the Dub TypeScript SDK
<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Install">
Install the [Dub TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/overview) using your preferred package manager:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="npm">
```bash
npm install dub
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="yarn">
```bash
yarn add dub zod # zod is a peer dependency
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm add dub
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize">
Then, initialize the Dub TypeScript SDK with your API key.
```typescript lib/dub.ts
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY, // optional, defaults to DUB_API_KEY env variable
});
```
You can now use the `dub` object to interact with the Dub API.
```typescript
import { dub } from "./lib/dub";
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## 3. Create link

</Accordion>
Optionally, you can also pass an `externalId` field which is a unique identifier for the link in your own database to associate it with the link in Dub's system.
```typescript app/routes/create-link.ts
export const loader = async () => {
try {
const result = await dub.links.create({
url: "https://www.google.com",
externalId: "12345",
});
return json(result, 200);
} catch (error: any) {
console.error(error);
return json(error, 400);
}
};
```
This will let you easily [update the link](#5-update-link) or [retrieve analytics](#6-retrieve-analytics-for-link) for it later on using the `externalId` instead of the Dub `linkId`.
## 4. Upsert link
Dub TypeScript SDK provides a method to upsert a link – where an existing link is updated if it exists, or a new link is created if it doesn't. so you don't have to worry about checking if the link already exists.
```typescript app/routes/upsert-link.ts
export const loader = async () => {
try {
const result = await dub.links.upsert({
url: "https://www.google.com",
});
return json(result, 200);
} catch (error: any) {
console.error(error);
return json(error, 400);
}
};
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with `ext_`).
```typescript app/routes/update-link.ts
export const loader = async () => {
try {
// Update a link by its linkId
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.update(
"link_rWOKByP0bRMrstK8e4HPjprJ",
{
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
}
);
// Update a link by its externalId
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.update("ext_12345", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
return json({ shortLink }, 200);
} catch (error: any) {
console.error(error);
return json(error, 400);
}
};
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Dub allows you to retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
```typescript app/routes/analytics.ts
export const loader = async () => {
try {
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const result = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
linkId: "clv3o9p9q000au1h0mc7r6l63",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
return json(timeseries, 200);
} catch (error: any) {
console.error(error);
return json(error, 400);
}
};
```
Similarly, you can retrieve analytics for a link using the `externalId` field.
```typescript app/routes/analytics.ts
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
externalId: "ext_12345",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
```

),
)
res = dub.links.upsert(req)
content_type :json
res.raw_response.body
end
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub Ruby SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with `ext_`).
```ruby index.rb
patch "/links" do
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::UpdateLinkRequest.new(
link_id: "clyci5h0w000511sjmu0tyjv9",
request_body: ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::UpdateLinkRequestBody.new(
url: 'https://google.uk'
)
)
res = dub.links.update(req)
content_type :json
res.raw_response.body
end
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Let's retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub Ruby SDK.
```ruby index.rb
get "/analytics" do
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RetrieveAnalyticsRequest.new(
link_id: "clx1gvi9o0005hf5momm6f7hj",
interval: ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::Interval::SEVEND,
group_by: ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::GroupBy::TIMESERIES
)
res = dub.analytics.retrieve(req)
content_type :json
res.raw_response.body
end
```

Learn how to integrate Dub with TypeScript.
## 1. Prerequisites
To follow this guide, you will need to:
* [Create a Dub account](https://d.to/try)
* [Create an API key](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens)
## 2. Install and initialize the Dub TypeScript SDK
<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Install">
Install the [Dub TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/overview) using your preferred package manager:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="npm">
```bash
npm install dub
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="yarn">
```bash
yarn add dub zod # zod is a peer dependency
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm add dub
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize">
Then, initialize the Dub TypeScript SDK with your API key.
```typescript lib/dub.ts
import { Dub } from "dub";
export const dub = new Dub({
token: process.env.DUB_API_KEY, // optional, defaults to DUB_API_KEY env variable
});
```
You can now use the `dub` object to interact with the Dub API.
```typescript
import { dub } from "./lib/dub";
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## 3. Create link
Let's create a short link using the [Dub TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/overview).

</Accordion>
Optionally, you can also pass an `externalId` field which is a unique identifier for the link in your own database to associate it with the link in Dub's system.
```typescript create-link-external-id.ts
await dub.links.create({
url: "https://google.com",
externalId: "12345",
});
```
This will let you easily [update the link](#5-update-link) or [retrieve analytics](#6-retrieve-analytics-for-link) for it later on using the `externalId` instead of the Dub `linkId`.
## 4. Upsert link
Dub TypeScript SDK provides a method to upsert a link – where an existing link is updated if it exists, or a new link is created if it doesn't. so you don't have to worry about checking if the link already exists.
```typescript upsert-link.ts
const { shortLink } = await dub.links.upsert({
url: "https://www.google.com",
});
console.log(shortLink); // will always be the same short link
```
This way, you won't have to worry about checking if the link already exists when you're creating it.
## 5. Update link
Let's update an existing link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
You can do that in two ways:
* Using the link's `linkId` in Dub's system.
* Using the link's `externalId` in your own database (prefixed with `ext_`).
```typescript update-link.ts
// Update a link by its linkId
await dub.links.update("link_rWOKByP0bRMrstK8e4HPjprJ", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
// Update a link by its externalId
await dub.links.update("ext_12345", {
url: "https://www.google.uk", // new URL
});
```
## 6. Retrieve analytics for link
Dub allows you to retrieve analytics for a link using the Dub TypeScript SDK.
```typescript get-analytics.ts
import { ClicksTimeseries } from "dub/models/components";
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
linkId: "clv3o9p9q000au1h0mc7r6l63",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
```
Similarly, you can retrieve analytics for a link using the `externalId` field.
```typescript get-analytics-external-id.ts
import { ClicksTimeseries } from "dub/models/components";
// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
const response = await dub.analytics.retrieve({
externalId: "ext_12345",
interval: "7d",
groupBy: "timeseries",
});
const timeseries = response as ClicksTimeseries[];
```

# Self-hosting Dub
Source: https://dub.co/docs/self-hosting
An end-to-end guide on how to self-host Dub – the open-source link management platform.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/logo-background-gradient.png" alt="Dub Logo on a gradient background" width="1200" height="630" />
</Frame>
You can self-host Dub on your own servers and cloud infrastructure for greater control over your data and design. This guide will walk you through the entire process of setting up Dub on your own servers.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
* A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
* An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
* A [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) account
* A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
* Either a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.com) account
You'll also need a custom domain that you will be using for your Dub instance, with an optional custom short domain for your links.
In this guide, we'll use `acme.com` as a placeholder for your custom domain, and `ac.me` as a placeholder for your custom short domain.
## Step 1: Local setup
First, you'll need to clone the Dub repo and install the dependencies.
<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repo">
First, clone the [Dub repo](https://d.to/github) into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code or allow users to interact with the code remotely (e.g., as part of a hosted application), make sure to provide source access (including modifications) as required by the [AGPLv3 license](https://d.to/license).
```bash Terminal
git clone https://github.com/dubinc/dub.git
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install dependencies">
Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```bash Terminal
pnpm i
```
</Step>
<Step title="Remove unnecessary files">
Delete the `apps/web/vercel.json` file since cron jobs are not required for the self-hosted version:
```bash Terminal
rm apps/web/vercel.json
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up environment variables">
Convert the `.env.example` file to `.env`. You can start filling in the first few environment variables:
```bash Terminal
# The domain that your app will be hosted on
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=acme.com
# The short domain that your app will be using (could be the same as the above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN=ac.me
# The ID of the Vercel team that your app will be deployed to: https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team#find-your-team-id
TEAM_ID_VERCEL=
# The unique access token for your Vercel account: https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token
AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN=
```
You will fill in the remaining environment variables in the following steps.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 2: Set up Tinybird Clickhouse database
Next, you'll need to set up the [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) Clickhouse database. This will be used to store time-series click events data.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Tinybird Workspace">
In your [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.
Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). Paste this token as the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Tinybird CLI and authenticate">
In your newly-cloned Dub repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.
Install the Tinybird CLI with `pip install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).
Run `tb auth` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.
</Step>
<Step title="Publish Tinybird datasource and endpoints">
Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):
```bash Terminal
$ tb push
** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
...
** Building dependencies
** Running 'click_events'
** 'click_events' created
** Running 'device'
** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
** => Test endpoint with:
** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
** 'device' created
...
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up Tinybird API base URL">
You will then need to update your [Tinybird API base URL](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/api-reference/api-reference.html#regions-and-endpoints) to match the region of your database.
From the previous step, take note of the **Test endpoint** URL. It should look something like this:
```bash Terminal
Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
```
Copy the base URL and paste it as the `TINYBIRD_API_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.
```bash Terminal
TINYBIRD_API_URL=https://api.us-east.tinybird.co
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 3: Set up Upstash Redis database
Next, you'll need to set up the [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis database. This will be used to cache link metadata and serve link redirects.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Upstash database">
In your [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/), create a new database.
For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.
<Frame>![Upstash Redis database](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/upstash-create-db.png)</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Set up Upstash environment variables">
Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section into your `.env` file.
<Frame>![Upstash Redis tokens](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/upstash-redis-tokens.png)</Frame>
Navigate to the [QStash tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Request Builder** section into your `.env` file.
<Frame>
![Upstash QStash tokens](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/upstash-qstash-tokens.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 4: Set up PlanetScale MySQL database
Next, you'll need to set up a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)-compatible MySQL database. This will be used to store user data and link metadata.
{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Note>
PlanetScale recently [removed their free
tier](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever), so you'll need to pay
for this option. A cheaper alternative is to use a [MySQL database on
Railway](https://railway.app/template/mysql) (\$5/month).
For [local development](local-development), we recommend using a [local MySQL database
with PlanetScale simulator](local-development#option-1-local-mysql-database-with-planetscale-simulator-recommended) (100% free).
</Note>
<Steps>
<Step title="Create PlanetScale database">
In your [PlanetScale account](https://app.planetscale.com/), create a new database.
Once your database is created, you'll be prompted to select your language or Framework. Select **Prisma**.
<Frame>
![PlanetScale choose framework](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/planetscale-choose-framework.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Set up PlanetScale environment variables">
Then, you'll have to create a new password for your database. Once the password is created, scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** section and copy the `DATABASE_URL` into your `.env` file.
<Frame>
![PlanetScale add credentials](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/planetscale-add-credentials.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Prisma client and create database tables">
In your Dub codebase, navigate to `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma` and replace all the columns in the `DefaultDomains` model to the normalized version of your custom short domain (removing the `.` character).
For example, if your custom short domain is `ac.me`, your `DefaultDomains` model should look like this:
```prisma apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
model DefaultDomains {
id          String   @id @default(cuid())
acme        Boolean  @default(true)
projectId   String   @unique
project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```
In the terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:
```bash Terminal
pnpm run prisma:generate
```
Then, create the database tables with the following command:
```bash Terminal
pnpm run prisma:push
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 5: Set up GitHub OAuth
Next, [create a new GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). This will allow you to sign in to Dub with your GitHub account.
Don't forget to set the following Callback URLs:
* `https://app.acme.com/api/auth/callback/github`
* `http://localhost:8888/api/auth/callback/github` for local development.
<Info>
Optional: Set the "Email addresses" account permission to **read-only** in
order to access private email addresses on GitHub.
</Info>
Once your GitHub App is created, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into your `.env` file as the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.
## Step 6: Set up Cloudflare R2
Dub stores user-generated assets in either S3 or S3-compatible services like [Cloudflare R2](https://cloudflare.com/r2). These include:
* Project logos
* User avatars
* [Custom Social Media Cards](https://dub.co/help/article/custom-link-previews) images
We recommend using [Cloudflare R2](https://cloudflare.com/r2) for self-hosting Dub, as it's a more cost-effective solution compared to AWS S3. Here's how you can set it up:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create R2 bucket">
<Note>You'll need to subscribe to the R2 service if you haven't already.</Note>
In your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), create a new R2 bucket. We recommend giving your bucket a descriptive name (e.g. `dubassets`) and leaving the remaining settings as is.
<Frame>![Cloudflare R2 bucket](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/cloudflare-r2-create-bucket.png)</Frame>
In your bucket settings, copy the **S3 API** value – you'll need it in Step 3.
</Step>
<Step title="Set up access to R2">
From the R2 main page, click **Manage R2 API Tokens** on the right-hand column.
<Frame>
![Cloudflare manage API tokens](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/cloudflare-r2-manage-api-tokens.png)
</Frame>
Then, click **Create API Token**.
<Frame>
![Cloudflare R2 API token](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/cloudflare-r2-create-api-token.png)
</Frame>
Make sure to name your API token something relevant to the service that will be using the token.
Give it "Object Read & Write" permissions, and we recommend only applying ito to a single bucket.
You can leave the remaining settings (TTL, Client IP Address Filtering) as is, and click **Create API Token**.
After you create you token, copy the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` values – you'll need them in the next step.
</Step>
<Step title="Set up R2 environment variables">
Once you have your credentials, set them in your `.env` file:
```TypeScript .env
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID= // this is the Access Key ID value from Step 2
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= // this is the Secret Access Key value from Step 2
STORAGE_ENDPOINT= // this is the S3 API value from Step 1
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up R2 domain">
In order for your images to be publically accessible in R2 you need to setup a domain. You can either use your own domain or an R2.dev subdomain.
To use your own domain, you'll need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings that points to your R2 bucket.
In you plan to use an R2.dev subdomain, make sure you "Allow Access".
Then set the `STORAGE_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file to the domain you chose.
```bash
STORAGE_BASE_URL={URL your assets as available at} # https://static.example.com
```
<Frame>![Cloudflare R2 domain](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/cloudflare-r2-public-domain.png)</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 7: Set up Resend (optional)
<Note>
Note that if you want to use magic link sign-in, this is a required step.
</Note>
Next, you'll need to set up Resend for transactional emails (e.g. magic link emails):
1. Sign up for Resend and [create your API key here](https://resend.com/api-keys).
2. Copy the API key into your `.env` file as the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. You'll then need to set up and verify your domain by [following this guide here](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction).
## Step 8: Set up Unsplash (optional)
Dub uses Unsplash's API for the [Custom Social Media Cards](https://dub.co/help/article/custom-link-previews) feature. You'll need to set up an Unsplash application to get an access key.
<Frame>
![Custom social media
cards](https://assets.dub.co/changelog/custom-social-cards.png)
</Frame>
Check out Unsplash's [official documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account) to learn how you can set up the `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` env var.
## Step 9: Deploy to Vercel
Once you've set up all of the above services, you can now deploy your app to Vercel.
<Steps>
<Step title="Deploy code to GitHub">
If you haven't already, push up your cloned repository to GitHub by running the following commands:
```bash Terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create a new Vercel project">
In your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/), create a new project. Then, select your GitHub repository and click **Import**.
Make sure that your **Framework Preset** is set to **Next.js** and the **Root Directory** is set to `apps/web`.
<Frame>
![Vercel Framework Preset and Root Directory](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/vercel-framework-preset.png)
</Frame>
In the **Environment Variables** section, add all of the environment variables from your `.env` file by copying all of them and pasting it into the first input field. A few notes:
* Remove the `PROJECT_ID_VERCEL` environment variable for now since we will only get the project ID after deploying the project.
* Replace the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable with the app domain that you will be using (e.g. `https://app.acme.com`).
Click on **Deploy** to deploy your project.
<Tip>
If you get a `No Output Directory called "public" was found after the build
completed` error, make sure that your [Vercel deployment
settings](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) to make sure that they match the following:
<Frame>
![Vercel Deploy settings](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/vercel-deploy-settings.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Add required environment variables">
Once the project deploys, retrieve your [Vercel project ID](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#project-id) and add it as the `PROJECT_ID_VERCEL` environment variable – both in your `.env` file and in your newly created Vercel project's settings (under **Settings > Environment Variables**)
Add both the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN` as domains in your Vercel project's settings (under **Settings** > **Domains**). You can follow this guide to learn [how to set up a custom domain on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain).
</Step>
<Step title="Redeploy your Vercel project">
Go back to the **Deployments** page and redeploy your project.
Once the deployment is complete, you should be able to visit your app domain (e.g. `https://app.acme.com`) and see the following login page:
<Frame>![Whitelabeled Login](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dub/images/whitelabeled-login.png)</Frame>
</Step>

## Caveats
This guide is meant to be a starting point for self-hosting Dub. It currently depends on the following services to work:
* [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) for the analytics database
* [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for the Redis database
* [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) for the MySQL database
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting & [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)
In the future, we plan to make it easier to self-host Dub by making these dependencies optional by swapping them out for native databases (e.g. mysql, redis, clickhouse, [GeoLite2](https://github.com/GitSquared/node-geolite2-redist) etc.)
Also, Docker is currently not supported, but we have a few [open](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/25) [issues](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/378) and [PRs](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/pull/391) for it.
