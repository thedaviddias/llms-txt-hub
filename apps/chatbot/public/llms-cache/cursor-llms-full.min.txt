Guide to Cursor billing: manage subscriptions, seats, cycles, and payments through Stripe portal
We use Stripe as our billing and payments provider
### How do I access billing settings?
The billing portal is where you'll manage all aspects of your subscription. You can access it through the [dashboard](https://cursor.com/settings) by clicking the "Billing" button in your account settings. This takes you to a secure portal where you can handle all billing-related tasks.

</Frame>
### What are Cursor's billing cycles?
Billing cycles run on either a monthly or annual basis, starting on the day you subscribe. For Business accounts with multiple seats, we use prorated billing when your team size changes. This means you only pay for the actual time each seat is used within a billing cycle.
### How do team seats work for Business accounts?
Business accounts use a per-seat billing model where each team member requires one seat license. When adding new members mid-cycle, you're only charged for their remaining time in that billing period. Team admins can manage seats directly through the dashboard.
### Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?
Yes you can! Here's how:
**Pro plan**
1. Go to [settings](https://cursor.com/settings)
2. Click on "Manage subscription" and you will be taken to the billing portal
3. Click on "Update subscription"
4. From here you can switch between monthly and annual billing
5. Select "Yearly" or "Monthly", then click on "Continue"
**Business plan**
1. Go to [settings](https://cursor.com/settings)
2. In the account section, click on "Advanced" then "Upgrade to yearly billing"
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/plans/business/upgrade-to-yearly.png" />
</Frame>
<Note>
Please note that you can only switch from monthly to yearly billing
self-serve. To switch from yearly to monthly billing, please contact us at
[hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com).
</Note>
### Where can I find my invoices?
All your billing history is available in the billing portal, where you can view and download both current and past invoices.
### Can I get invoices automatically emailed to me?
Currently, invoices need to be downloaded manually from the billing portal. We know this is a hassle, so we're developing automatic invoice emails as a new feature, and once available, you'll be able to opt-in!
### How do I update my billing information?
You can update your payment method, company name, address, and tax information through the billing portal. We use Stripe as our payment processor to ensure secure transactions. Please note that changes to billing information will only affect future invoices - we cannot modify historical invoices.
### How do I cancel my subscription?
You can cancel your subscription directly through the billing portal using the "Cancel subscription" button. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing period.
### I'm having other billing issues. How can I get help?
For any billing-related questions not covered here, please email us at [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com). Include your account details and specific concerns, and our team will help you resolve them quickly!
### Can I get a refund?
You can self-serve a refund by going to the billing portal and clicking on the `Cancel subscription` button. Our self-serve refund policy is as follows:
**EU, UK or Turkey customers**
* Eligible for a refund if you cancel your subscription within 14 days of purchase.
**All other customers (US + rest of world)**
* Monthly subscriptions: Refundable within 24 hours after purchase.
* Annual subscriptions: Refundable within 72 hours after purchase
If you're not in the window of self-serve refunds, reach out to us at [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) and we'll help you!

## Understanding Usage
### Fast and Slow Requests
There are two types of requests in Cursor, **slow** and **fast** that has its own pool.
By default, Cursor servers try to give all users fast `premium` model requests. However, when users run out of fast `premium` credits, they are moved to a slow pool. Wait times in the slow pool are calculated proportionally to how many slow requests you've used, so they generally remain manageable unless you're well over your fast request limit.
To bypass wait times entirely, you can enable usage-based pricing (you'll only be charged for requests beyond your included fast requests).
See [models](/settings/models) for an overview of which models are `premium` and their alternatives.
### Included Requests
Every subscription includes a set amount of fast requests. The number of included requests depends on your plan as shown in the plan comparison above.
### Additional Requests
We offer usage-based pricing for additional requests beyond your plan's included quota:
#### Usage-based Pricing
You may opt in to usage-based pricing for requests that go beyond what is included in your Pro or Business plan from your [dashboard](/account/dashboard).
<Info>Usage-based pricing is only available with a paid subscription.</Info>
From the dashboard, you can toggle usage based pricing for `premium` models and `other` models (see [models](/settings/models) to understand which model is which). You can also configure a spend limit in USD to make sure you never go over that. Once the spending limit is hit, slow requests will be used.
We will bill for additional fast requests when you've made requests totaling \$20, **or** on the 2nd or 3rd day of the month, whichever comes first.
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Single invoice">
375 fast requests made with a `premium` model (\$15) will be billed at the beginning of the next month since the total value is under \$20
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Multiple invoices">
<p>
1150 fast requests made with a `premium` (\$46) will be billed 3 times:
</p>
<p>1. When first batch of 500 requests has been made (\$20)</p>
<p>2. When second batch of 500 requests has been made (also \$20)</p>
<p>3. Beginning of next month (remaining \$6)</p>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
For team accounts, administrators can restrict usage-based pricing settings to admin-only access.
Cost per request for each model can be found on the [models](/settings/models) page.
#### Fast Requests Packages
<Warning>Fast requests packages have been deprecated in favor of usage-based pricing. Existing users with additional packages can continue to use them and have the option to remove them, but new packages cannot be purchased.</Warning>
Fast Request Packages were bundles of 500 requests that could be purchased in addition to your plan's included quota. These have been replaced by usage-based pricing for fast requests, as purchasing them in bundles often meant users would pay for requests they didn't use.
### FAQ
#### When do my fast requests reset?
Your Fast Requests reset on a fixed monthly date based on when you first set up your plan. If you purchase additional requests (for example, upgrading from 500 to 1000 requests), the reset date remains unchanged. For instance, if your plan started on the 23rd, your requests will always reset on the 23rd of each month, regardless of when you purchase additional requests.
#### What does "500 premium requests" mean for teams?
Each user gets their own quota of 500 fast requests for premium models per month. These requests are not pooled across the team - every team member gets their own fresh 500 requests when their personal monthly cycle resets.

## Privacy FAQs
### What is Privacy Mode?
With `Privacy Mode` enabled, none of your code will ever be stored by us or any third-party. Otherwise, we may collect prompts, code snippets and telemetry data to improve Cursor. You can [read more about Privacy Mode here](https://cursor.com/privacy). Privacy mode is enforced for Business plans
You can enable `Privacy Mode` at onboarding or under `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Privacy Mode`.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/get-started/privacy-mode.png" alt="Privacy Mode" />
</Frame>
### Are requests always routed through the Cursor backend?
Yes! Even if you use your API key, your requests will still go through our backend. That's where we do our final prompt building.
### Does indexing the codebase require storing code?
It does not! If you choose to index your codebase, Cursor will upload your codebase in small chunks to our server to compute embeddings, but all plaintext code ceases to exist after the life of the request.
The embeddings and metadata about your codebase (hashes, obfuscated file names) are stored in our database, but none of your code is.
You can read more about this on our [security page](https://cursor.com/security).
# Analytics

The metrics dashboard shows usage statistics for your team over the last 30 days:
### Total Usage
View aggregate metrics across your entire team, including total tabs and premium requests used. For teams less than 30 days old, metrics reflect actual usage since team creation, including activity from team members' individual accounts prior to joining.
### Per Active User
See average usage metrics per active user, including tabs accepted, lines of code, and premium requests.
### User Activity
Track both weekly and monthly active user counts.
## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I see different request counts in the metrics page versus the team tab?">
The difference in numbers you're seeing is because the team tab shows requests for the current billing period, while the metrics page shows a rolling 30-day window. We know is can be confusing - we're working on making this clearer in the dashboard.

## Billing
When adding new team members:
* Each new member or admin adds a billable seat (see [pricing](https://cursor.com/pricing))
* Seat changes are prorated for your billing period
* Unpaid admin seats are not counted
Adding new team members in the middle of a month, we'll only charge you for the days they actually use. Similarly, if someone leaves the team, we'll credit your account for any unused days.
If you change someone's role (e.g from Admin to Unpaid Admin), we'll automatically adjust the billing from the day of the change. You can choose to be billed either monthly or yearly - both options are available to suit your needs.
### Switching from monthly to yearly billing
You can save 20% of the Business plan by switching from monthly to yearly billing. This can be done from the [dashboard](/account/dashboard)

## FAQ
### How can I purchase 10 licenses for my company?
Start by creating a team, then invite your team members. We charge based on the amount of users in your team. We don't have a fixed amount of seats, it's prorated as you update team members
### How can I set up a team when I'm not going to use Cursor myself?
We require at least one paid member to create a team. If you are creating the team, we require you to start as a paid member. After you've invited another member to the team, you can assign yourself the [Unpaid Admin role](/account/teams/members). Seat changes are not billed immediately, so you can set up a team, invite a member and change your own role without being charged

# Notepads (Beta)
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/beta/notepads
A guide to using Notepads in Cursor for sharing context between Composers and Chat interactions
<Warning>
Notepads are currently in beta and subject to be deprecated in the future.
</Warning>
# Overview
Notepads are powerful context-sharing tools in Cursor that bridge the gap between composers and chat interactions. Think of them as enhanced reference documents that go beyond the capabilities of `.cursorrules`, allowing you to create reusable contexts for your development workflow.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/features/beta/notepads/empty-notepad.png" />
</Frame>
Notepads serve as collections of thoughts, rules, and documentation that can be:
* Shared between different parts of your development environment
* Referenced using the `@` syntax
* Enhanced with file attachments
* Used as dynamic templates for various development scenarios
## Getting started
1. Click the "+" button in the Notepads section
2. Give your notepad a meaningful name
3. Add your content, context, files and other relevant information the same way you would in composer or chat.
4. Reference it in composers or chat using `@`
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/features/beta/notepads/create-notepad.png" />

The reasoning capabilities of Agent enables some very powerful workflows where it can perform many consecutive actions without much supervision. When needed, Agent will automatically search the web to find relevant information, documentation, or examples to help with your task.
<Frame>

</Frame>
<Tip>
Agent can make up to 25 tool calls before stopping. When the limit is reached, you can press "Continue"
to let Agent make more tool calls (every "Continue" call is counted as one [request](/account/usage)).
</Tip>
### Terminal
When Agent runs terminal commands, it uses VS Code's terminal profiles to determine which shell to use. It iterates through the available profiles, starting with the default one, and selects the first profile that supports command detection. This means the shell used by Agent might differ from your default system shell if another compatible terminal profile is found first.
To change which terminal profile is used:
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
3. Select your preferred terminal profile
## Yolo mode
With Yolo mode enabled, Agent can execute terminal commands by itself. This especially useful when running test suites. Instruct Agent with a task and how to verify changes (running a test), and it will continue until the task is completed.
### Guardrails
You can define guardrails and allow/deny lists for certain commands you don't want Agent to run automatically. This is done from Cursor Settings

</Frame>
## Rules
You can direct the Agent with [rules](/context/rules-for-ai). They can auto attached to any Agent request based on glob patterns, or the Agent can grab one based on the rule description.

## Models
You can use `claude-3.5-sonnet`, `gpt-4o` and `o3-mini` with Agent today. We'll be adding more models soon!
## FAQ
### What's the difference between Agent and Composer?
You can toggle between Normal and Agent mode in Composer. The main difference is that Agent will think harder, use reasoning and tools to solve problems thrown at it. Normal mode (Edit) is for single-turn edits, while Ask mode helps you understand and explore your code.
# Apply
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/chat/apply
Learn how to apply, accept, or reject code suggestions from chat using Cursor's Apply feature
Cursor's `Apply` allows you to quickly integrate a codeblock suggestion from the chat into your code.
## Apply Code Blocks
To apply a code block suggestion, you can press on the play button in the top right corner of each chat code block.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/chat/apply.png" />
</Frame>
This will edit your file to incorporate the code produced by Chat. Since you can add the most context and have the most back-and-forth with the model in Chat,
we recommend Chat + Apply for more complex AI-driven code changes.
## Accept or Reject
Once you have applied a code block, you can go through the diffs and accept or reject the changes. You can also click
on the "Accept" or "Reject" buttons in the top right corner of the chat code block.
`Ctrl/⌘ Enter` to accept, `Ctrl/⌘ Backspace` to reject.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview
Unified AI interface that combines Ask, Edit, and Agent modes to help write, edit, and understand code directly in your editor
Cursor's unified AI interface combines different capabilities in one seamless experience. Use `⌘I` to open it, and `⌘N` to create a new conversation. Switch between modes using the mode picker in the input box.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/composer/empty-composer-0.46.png" alt="Unified AI Interface" />
</Frame>
## Modes
The interface offers three modes that you can select from the mode picker:
<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Agent" icon="head-side-gear" href="/chat/agent">
Access tools and reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. Default mode. (⌘I)
</Card>
<Card title="Edit" icon="pen-to-square">
Make single-turn edits to your code with precision and clarity.
</Card>
<Card title="Ask" icon="comments">
Ask questions about your code, get explanations, and discover your codebase. (⌘L)
</Card>
</CardGroup>
You can switch between modes during a conversation using the mode picker or `⌘.` shortcut. This flexibility lets you adapt to your current needs - from asking questions to making changes to using advanced tools.
## Context
You can use [@-symbols](/context/@-symbols/basic) to include relevant context in your prompts. The interface will automatically suggest relevant context based on your query.
### Autocontext (Beta)
Cursor can automatically include relevant code in your conversations using embeddings and a custom model. Instead of manually selecting context with @-symbols, it analyzes your prompt and includes the most relevant code from your codebase. Enable this feature in Settings > Features > Autocontext.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@-symbols-basics.png" alt="@ Symbol Context Menu" />
</Frame>
## Generating & Applying Changes
Cursor has a custom model trained in-house that is able to take a series of edits, as suggested by the AI model you are using, and apply it to files with 1000s of lines in seconds.
This happens automatically in both Agent and Edit modes.
In Ask mode, you can apply changes by clicking the `Apply` button in the bottom right of the diff view.
Once your changes have been made, you can review them inside your codebase, and then choose to accept or reject them, if you'd like to interate further.
<Card horizontal title="Learn More about Apply" icon="code-commit" href="/chat/apply">
Find out more about applying changes with Cursor's custom trained model.
</Card>
## Checkpoints
For every iteration a checkpoint is created. You can return to any previous version by clicking on `checkout` near that checkpoint. This is handy if you don't like the current changes and want to revert to an earlier state.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/composer/checkpoints.png" alt="Checkpoints" />
</Frame>
## Chat History
Access previous conversations through the history. Open it from the history icon to the right of Cursor Tab. You'll see a list of past conversations which you can revisit, rename, or remove.
Open with `⌘+⌥+L` or `Ctrl+Alt+L` when the interface is focused.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/composer/history.png" alt="History Icon" />
</Frame>
## Layout
* **Pane**: A sidebar with the interface on the left and your code editor on the right.
* **Editor**: A single editor window, similar to viewing code normally. You can move it around, split it, or even place it in a separate window.
* **Floating**: A draggable window that you can position where you like
You can change this from the menu > Open as \[layout]
## Iterate on lints
Cursor gives the AI direct access to the linter within your codebase, which helps it check over it's own code, as well as existing code in your project.
When Cursor detects issues flagged by an installed linter, the AI can intelligently attempt to fix them on it's own, with the ability to iterate on the changes if needed.
This means you will always end up with clean, compliant code without having to manually check and fix any issues.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/composer/iterate-on-lint.png" alt="Iterate on Lint Fix" />
</Frame>
<Note>
Some languages (like Rust) require files to be saved before lint errors
appear, which may limit this feature's effectiveness in all languages.
</Note>
## FAQ
### What's the difference between the modes?
**Ask mode** helps you understand and explore code. Use it to ask questions, get explanations, and learn about your codebase.
**Edit mode** focuses on making single-turn edits to your code. It provides a workspace where you can make precise changes to your files.
**Agent mode** (default) combines both capabilities with additional tools and reasoning abilities for handling complex tasks.
### How are long conversations handled?
For long conversations, Cursor summarizes earlier messages with smaller models like `cursor-small` and `gpt-4o-mini` to keep responses fast and relevant.
This approach helps ensure that even extended conversations remain responsive and coherent, without losing track of key details from earlier exchanges.
### Can I access my conversation history on another computer?
Conversation history is stored locally on your computer and is not stored on Cursor's servers or tied to your Cursor account.
This means if you switch to a different computer, you won't have access to your previous history. You can only access your history on the computer where it was originally created.
# Overview
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/cmdk/overview
Learn how to use Cmd/Ctrl K in Cursor to generate, edit code and ask questions with the Prompt Bar
Cmd K, also known or "Ctrl K" on Windows/Linux, allows you to generate new code or edit existing code in the editor window.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cmdk/regular.png" />
</Frame>
## Prompt Bars
In Cursor, we call the bar that appears when you press `Ctrl/Cmd K` the "Prompt Bar". It works similarly to the AI input box for chat, in
which you can type normally, or use [@ symbols](context/@-symbols) to reference other context.
## Inline Generation
If no code is selected when you press `Ctrl/Cmd K`, Cursor will generate new code based on the prompt you type in the prompt bar.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cmdk/generate.png" />
</Frame>
## Inline Edits
For in-place edits, you can simply select the code you want to edit and type into the prompt bar.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cmdk/edit.png" />
</Frame>
## Follow-up Instructions
After each generation, you can further refine the prompt by adding more instructions to the prompt bar, and pressing `Enter` so the AI regenerates based on your follow-up instructions.
## Default Context
By default, Cursor will try to find different kinds of useful information to improve code generation, in addition to the manual [@ symbols](/context/@-symbols/@-files) you include.
Additional context may include related files, recently viewed files, and more. After gathering, Cursor ranks the context items by relevance to your edit/generation
and keeps the top items in context for the large language model.
## Quick Question
If you press `Option/Alt Enter` while in the prompt bar, Cursor will respond to any questions you have about the selection, and the context you have attached.
The contents of this conversation could be further used in follow-up generations, so you could simply type "do it" after Cursor comes up with a response to generate the code after a quick question.
# Terminal Cmd K
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/cmdk/terminal-cmdk
Use Ctrl/⌘ K in Cursor terminal to generate and run commands through a prompt bar interface
In the built-in Cursor terminal, you can press `Ctrl/⌘ K` to open a prompt bar on the bottom of the terminal.
This prompt bar allows you to describe your desired action in the terminal, and terminal Cmd K will generate a command.
You can accept the command by hitting `esc` or run the command immediately with `Ctrl/⌘ + Enter`.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cmdk/terminal-cmdk.png" />
</Frame>
By default, Terminal Cmd K sees your recent terminal history, your instructions, and anything else you put in the prompt bar as context.
# @Code
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-code
Learn to reference code using @Code symbol and keyboard shortcuts for adding code to Chat or Edit
To reference specific sections of code, you can use the `@Code` symbol.
## Code Preview
Similar to the [`@Files`](/context/@-symbols/@-files) symbol, Cursor will show a preview of the code's content so you can verify that the code you're referencing is the correct one.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@code.png" />
</Frame>
## From the Editor
Another way to add code snippets as context is to select the code you want to reference, and click on either "Add to Chat" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift L`) or "Add to Edit" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift K`).
These will add the selected code snippet to either the Chat input box or the currently active Cmd K prompt bar.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@code-select.png" />

Through `@Codebase`, Chat goes through these steps until it finds the most important pieces of code to use.
* Gathering: scanning through your codebase for important files / code chunks
* Reranking: reordering the context items based on relevancy to the query
* Reasoning: thinking through a plan of using the context
* Generating: coming up with a response
Another way of submitting an advanced codebase query is to click on the dropdown next to the `Ctrl/⌘ + Enter` button and select `reranker` for the search behavior.
This is only available when `@Codebase` isn't used, otherwise `@Codebase` takes precedence.

With `@Web`, Cursor constructs a search query based on the query and the context you've provided, and searches the web to
find relevant information as additional context.
This can be useful to allow Cursor to find the most up-to-date information online, or to allow Cursor to scrape multiple websites in a few seconds to find the best answer, without the user having to manually search anywhere.
<Tip>When using Agent mode, Cursor will automatically search the web when it needs up-to-date information or additional context.</Tip>
# Overview
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview
Overview of all @ symbols available in Cursor for context and commands
In Cursors input boxes, such as in Composer, Chat and Cmd K, you can use @ symbols by typing `@`. A popup menu will appear with a list of suggestions,
and it will automatically filter to only show the most relevant suggestions based on your input.
## Keyboard Shortcuts
You can navigate through the list of suggestions using the up/down arrow keys. You can hit `Enter` to select a suggestion. If the suggestion is a category, such as `Files`,
the suggestions will be filtered to only show the most relevant items within that category.

# Codebase Indexing
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/context/codebase-indexing
Learn how to index your codebase in Cursor for more accurate AI assistance and search results
### Index your Codebase
For better and more accurate codebase answers, you can index your codebase. Behind the scenes, Cursor
computes embeddings for each file in your codebase, and will use these to improve the accuracy of your codebase answers.
When a project is opened, each Cursor instance will initialize indexing for that workspace. After the initial indexing setup is complete, Cursor will automatically index any new files added to your workspace to keep your codebase context current.
The status of your codebase indexing is under `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Codebase Indexing`.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/chat/codebase-indexing.png" />
</Frame>
### Advanced Settings
By default, Cursor will index all files in your codebase.
You can also expand the `Show Settings` section to access more advanced options.
Here, you can decide whether you want to enable automatic indexing for new repositories and configure the files
that Cursor will ignore during repository indexing.
Cursor uses the same package as VS Code to handle file ignoring, which means it respects all `.gitignore` files, including those in subdirectories. You can also create a `.cursorignore` file for user-specific ignore patterns, which you may want to add to your global `.gitignore` to avoid committing it to the repository.
If you have any large content files in your project that the AI definitely doesn't need to read, [ignoring those files](/context/ignore-files) could improve the accuracy of the answers.
### Working with large monorepos
When working with large monorepos containing hundreds of thousands of files, it's important to be strategic about what gets indexed.
* Use `.cursorignore` to let each developer configure which folders and paths they work on in the monorepo
* Add `.cursorignore` to your global `.gitignore`
This allows each developer to optimize indexing for their specific work areas within the monorepo.
## FAQ
### Where can I see all codebases I have indexed?
Currently, there is no way to see a list of all codebases you have indexed. You'll need to manually check each project's indexing status by opening the project in Cursor and checking the Codebase Indexing settings.
### How do I delete all codebases?
You can either delete your Cursor account from Settings to remove all indexed codebases, or manually delete individual codebases from the Codebase Indexing settings in each project. There's currently no way to delete all codebases at once without deleting your account.

Cursor provides two different ignore files to control how files are handled:
* `.cursorignore`: Makes a best-effort attempt to exclude files from both AI features and indexing
* `.cursorindexingignore`: Controls only which files are indexed for search and context (same as the old `.cursorignore`)
<Note>
As of 0.46, `.cursorignore` attempts to exclude files from both AI access and indexing (similar to the previously unreleased `.cursorban`). For indexing-only control like the old `.cursorignore`, use `.cursorindexingignore`.
</Note>
## `.cursorignore`
<Warning>
The `.cursorignore` is best-effort, meaning we do not guarantee that files in it are blocked from being sent up. We may have bugs that allow ignored files to be sent up in certain cases. Please let us know if you find bugs like that and we will do our best to fix!
</Warning>
The `.cursorignore` file makes a best-effort attempt to exclude files from both AI features and indexing. This is useful for:
* Attempting to exclude sensitive files from AI access and indexing
* Excluding configuration files with secrets
* Limiting access to proprietary code
Files listed in `.cursorignore` will be excluded from Cursor's AI features in a best-effort way:
* Not included in tab and chat requests
* Not included in context for AI features
* Not indexed for search or context features
* Not available through @-symbols or other context tools
## `.cursorindexingignore`
<Tip>
`.cursorindexingignore` files automatically inherits all patterns from your `.gitignore` files
</Tip>
The `.cursorindexingignore` file only controls which files are indexed for search and context features. This provides the same indexing control as the old `.cursorignore`. Use this file when you want to:
* Exclude large generated files from indexing
* Skip indexing of binary files
* Control which parts of your codebase are searchable
* Optimize indexing performance
Important: Files in `.cursorindexingignore` can still be manually included as context or accessed by AI features - they just won't be automatically indexed or included in search results.
<Accordion title="Default Indexing Ignore Files">
For indexing only, in addition to the files designated in your `.gitignore`, `.cursorignore` and `.cursorindexignore` files, the following files are ignored by default. Note that these default files only apply to indexing, not to other AI features.

## File Format
Both files use the same syntax as `.gitignore`. Here are some examples:
### Basic Patterns
```sh
# Ignore all files in the `dist` directory
dist/
# Ignore all `.log` files
*.log
# Ignore specific file `config.json`
config.json
```
### Advanced Patterns
Include only `*.py` files in the `app` directory:
```sh
# ignore everything
*
# do not ignore app
!app/
# do not ignore directories inside app
!app/*/
!app/**/*/
# don't ignore python files
!*.py
```
## Troubleshooting
The ignore file syntax follows `.gitignore` exactly. If you encounter issues:
1. Replace "cursorignore" with "gitignore" in your search queries
2. Check [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gitignore) for similar patterns
3. Test patterns with `git check-ignore -v [file]` to understand matching
Common gotchas:
* Patterns are matched relative to the ignore file location
* Later patterns override earlier ones
* Directory patterns need a trailing slash
* Negation patterns (`!`) must negate a previous pattern
# Model Context Protocol
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol
Learn how to add and use custom MCP tools within Cursor feature
## What is MCP?
The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context and tools to LLMs. Think of MCP as a plugin system for Cursor - it allows you to extend the Agent's capabilities by connecting it to various data sources and tools through standardized interfaces.
<Card title="Learn More About MCP" icon="book-open" horizontal href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">
Visit the official MCP documentation to understand the protocol in depth
</Card>
### Uses
MCP allows you to connect Cursor to external systems and data sources. This means you can integrate Cursor with your existing tools and infrastructure, instead of having to tell Cursor what the structure of your project is outside of the code itself.
MCP servers can be **written in any language** that can print to `stdout` or serve an HTTP endpoint. This flexibility allows you to implement MCP servers using your preferred programming language and technology stack very quickly.
#### Examples
<Card title="Databases" icon="database">
Allow Cursor to query your databases directly, instead of manually feeding in schemas, or manipulating the data yourself.
</Card>
<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="Notion" icon="book">
Read data out of notion to guide cursor to implement a feature
</Card>
<Card title="GitHub" icon="github">
Let Cursor create PRs, create branches, find code, etc
</Card>
<Card title="Memory" icon="memory">
Allow Cursor to remember and recall information while you work
</Card>
<Card title="Stripe" icon="credit-card">
Allow Cursor to create customers, manage subscriptions, etc
</Card>
</CardGroup>
### Architecture
MCP servers are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol. They act as intermediaries between Cursor and external tools or data sources.
Cursor supports two transport types for MCP servers:
<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="💻 stdio Transport">
\- Runs on your **local machine**
\- Managed automatically by Cursor
\- Communicates directly via `stdout`
\- Only accessible by you locally
**Input:** Valid shell command that is ran by Cursor automatically
</Card>
<Card title="🌐 SSE Transport">
\- Can run **locally or remotely**
\- Managed and run by you
\- Communicates **over the network**
\- Can be **shared** across machines
**Input:** URL to the `/sse` endpoint of an MCP server external to Cursor
</Card>
</CardGroup>
<Tip>
For stdio servers, the command should be a valid shell command that Cursor can run.
For SSE servers, the URL should be the URL of the SSE endpoint, e.g. `http://example.com:8000/sse`.
</Tip>
Each transport type has different use cases, with stdio being simpler for local development and SSE offering more flexibility for distributed teams.
## Configuring MCP Servers
The MCP configuration file uses a JSON format with the following structure:
<CodeGroup>
```json CLI Server - Node.js
// This example demonstrated an MCP server using the stdio format
// Cursor automatically runs this process for you
// This uses a Node.js server, ran with `npx`
{
"mcpServers": {
"server-name": {
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "mcp-server"],
"env": {
"API_KEY": "value"
}
}
}
}
```
```json CLI Server - Python
// This example demonstrated an MCP server using the stdio format
// Cursor automatically runs this process for you
// This uses a Python server, ran with `python`
{
"mcpServers": {
"server-name": {
"command": "python",
"args": ["mcp-server.py"],
"env": {
"API_KEY": "value"
}
}
}
}
```
```json SSE Server
// This example demonstrated an MCP server using the SSE format
// The user should manually setup and run the server
// This could be networked, to allow others to access it too
{
"mcpServers": {
"server-name": {
"url": "http://localhost:3000/sse",
"env": {
"API_KEY": "value"
}
}
}
}
```
</CodeGroup>
<Tip>
The `env` field allows you to specify environment variables that will be available to your MCP server process. This is particularly useful for managing API keys and other sensitive configuration.
</Tip>
### Configuration Locations
You can place this configuration in two locations, depending on your use case:
<Card title="Project Configuration" icon="folder-tree">
For tools specific to a project, create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory. This allows you to define MCP servers that are only available within that specific project.
</Card>
<Card title="Global Configuration" icon="globe">
For tools that you want to use across all projects, create a `\~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory. This makes MCP servers available in all your Cursor workspaces.
</Card>
## Using MCP Tools in Agent
The Composer Agent will **automatically** use any MCP tools that are listed under `Available Tools` on the MCP settings page if it determines them to be relevant.
To prompt tool usage intentionally, simply tell the agent to use the tool, referring to it either by name or by description.
### Tool Approval
By default, when Agent wants to use an MCP tool, it will display a message asking for your approval. You can use the arrow next to the tool name to expand the message, and see what arguments the Agent is calling the tool with.
<Frame>
![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/advanced/mcp-mars-request.png)
</Frame>
#### Yolo Mode
You can enable Yolo mode to allow Agent to automatically run MCP tools without requiring approval, similar to how terminal commands are executed. Read more about Yolo mode and how to enable it [here](/agent#yolo-mode).
### Tool Response
When a tool is used Cursor will display the response in the chat.
This image shows the response from the sample tool, as well as expanded views of the tool call arguments and the tool call response.

</Frame>
## Limitations
MCP is a very new protocol and is still in active development. There are some known caveats to be aware of:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Tool Quantity">
Some MCP servers, or user's with many MCP servers active, may have many tools available for Cursor to use. Currently, Cursor will only send the first 40 tools to the Agent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Remote Development">
Cursor directly communicates with MCP servers from your local machine, either directly through `stdio` or via the network using `sse`. Therefore, MCP servers may not work properly when accessing Cursor over SSH or other development environments. We are hoping to improve this in future releases.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MCP Resources">
MCP servers offer two main capabilities: tools and resources. Tools are availabe in Cursor today, and allow Cursor to execute the tools offered by an MCP server, and use the output in it's further steps. However, resources are not yet supported in Cursor. We are hoping to add resource support in future releases.

# Rules for AI
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai
Learn how to customize AI behavior in Cursor using project-specific and global rules
Using rules in Cursor you can control the behavior of the underlying model. You can think of it as instructions and/or a system prompt for LLMs.
Inside Cursor, we have two main ways to customize the behavior of the AI to suit your needs:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Project Rules" icon="folder-tree">
Rules specific to a project, stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory. They are automatically included when matching files are referenced.
</Card>
<Card title="Global Rules" icon="globe">
Rules applied globally to all projects, configured in the `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Rules for AI` section.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
Learn more about how to use them in the following sections.
## Project Rules (recommended)
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/project-rules.png" />
</Frame>
Project rules offer a powerful and flexible system with path specific configurations. Project rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory and provide granular control over AI behavior in different parts of your project.
Here's how they work
* **Semantic Descriptions**: Each rule can include a description of when it should be applied
* **File Pattern Matching**: Use glob patterns to specify which files/folders the rule applies to
* **Automatic Attachment**: Rules can be automatically included when matching files are referenced
* **Reference files**: Use @file in your project rules to include them as context when the rule is applied.
<Tip>
You can reference rule files using @file, allowing you to chain multiple rules
together
</Tip>
You can create a new rule using the command palette with `Cmd + Shift + P` > `New Cursor Rule`. By using project rules you also get the benefit of version control since it's just a file
Example use cases:
* Framework-specific rules for certain file types (e.g., SolidJS preferences for `.tsx` files)
* Special handling for auto-generated files (e.g., `.proto` files)
* Custom UI development patterns
* Code style and architecture preferences for specific folders
## Global Rules
Global rules can be added by modifying the `Rules for AI` section under `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Rules for AI`. This is useful if you want to specify rules that should always be included in every project like output language, length of responses etc.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/rules-for-ai.png" />
</Frame>
## `.cursorrules`
For backward compatibility, you can still use a `.cursorrules` file in the root of your project. We will eventually remove .cursorrules in the future, so we recommend migrating to the new Project Rules system for better flexibility and control.

Now that you've installed Cursor, head over to the [Introduction](/get-started/introduction) to learn about Cursor's features and how to get started using them.
# Introduction
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction
Learn how to use Cursor's core features: Tab completion, Chat for code queries, and Agent for assistance
## Overview
Cursor is a powerful AI-first code editor that enhances your development workflow. After [installation](/get-started/installation), you'll have access to these core features that work together seamlessly to make you more productive:
* **AI-powered code completion** that understands your codebase and provides context-aware suggestions
* **Conversation interface** for exploring, understanding, and modifying code with Ask, Edit, and Agent modes
* **Intelligent tools** for handling complex development tasks
## Getting Started
Start exploring Cursor's AI-powered features:
* **Tab**: Press `Tab` for intelligent code completions
* **CMD-K**: Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` for inline code edits
* **Composer**: Use `⌘I` to open the unified AI interface with Ask, Edit, and Agent modes
## Settings
Cursor is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can configure it in two ways:
### Cursor Settings
* Access via gear icon, `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + J`, or Command Palette > `Cursor Settings`
* Configure AI features and Cursor-specific preferences
### Editor Settings
* Access via Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) > `"Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"`
* Adjust editor behavior and appearance
Let's explore each feature in detail:
### Tab
Tab completion in Cursor is powered by advanced AI models that understand your code context. As you type, you'll receive intelligent suggestions that:
* Complete your current line of code
* Suggest entire function implementations
* Help with common patterns and boilerplate
* Adapt to your coding style over time
Learn more about [Tab features](/tab/overview) or see how it [compares to GitHub Copilot](/tab/from-gh-copilot).
### Composer
Cursor provides a unified AI interface with three modes that seamlessly work together:
**Ask Mode**
* Ask questions about specific code sections
* Get explanations of complex functions
* Find code patterns and examples
* Discover and understand your codebase
**Edit Mode**
* Make single-turn edits to your code
* Apply targeted changes with precision
* Review and apply changes with confidence
* Work with files individually
**Agent Mode (Default)**
* Make codebase-wide changes and refactoring
* Implement new features from requirements
* Debug complex issues across multiple files
* Generate tests and documentation
* Maintain consistency across your entire project
Switch between modes during conversations to best suit your current task. Learn more about the [unified AI interface](/composer) or explore specific capabilities in [Agent mode](/agent).
### Context
Context is the foundation that powers all of Cursor's AI features. Here's how it works:
* When you open a codebase, we automatically [index your code](/context/codebase-indexing) to make it available as context
* Use [@-symbols](/context/@-symbols/basic) to precisely control what context you provide:
* [@files](/context/@-symbols/@-files) and [@folders](/context/@-symbols/@-folders) for specific paths
* [@web](/context/@-symbols/@-web) for external documentation
* [@git](/context/@-symbols/@-git) for version control context
* Configure [rules for AI](/context/rules-for-ai) to customize behavior
* Set up [MCP](/context/model-context-protocol) for external context providers
## Models
You can see all the models we support and their pricing on the [models page](/settings/models). Configure your [API keys](/settings/api-keys) and [preferences](/settings/preferences) in Settings.
## Usage
It's highly recommended to read about [usage](/account/usage) and [plans](/account/plans) to understand how Cursor pricing works. Check out our [pricing page](/account/pricing) for more details about plans and features.

## Where did Cursor come from?
Code is fundamentally text, and our tools for writing it have evolved from simple text editors into increasingly intelligent development environments.
Initially, we had features like syntax highlighting, to make code more readable. Then, we had features like autocomplete, to make code more efficient.
These have been the standard for a long time, but with Cursor, we're re-inventing how you work with code.
## How does it work?
Cursor provides the user with a few fundamental features that are only made possible by the development of LLMs (Large Language Models).
## How do I get started?
You can download Cursor from the [Cursor website](https://www.cursor.com) for your platform of choice. Being based on VS Code, it's extremely easy to get started, and all the AI features are opt-in.
You can also have Cursor import all your VS Code extensions and settings in one-click. To help you try Cursor, we have a 14-day free trial our of Pro plan, with no credit card required!

</Note>
## Setting up Java for Cursor
### Java Installation
Before setting up Cursor itself, you will need Java installed on your machine.
<Warning>
Cursor does not ship with a Java compiler, so you need to install a JDK if you haven't already.
</Warning>
<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Windows Installation" icon="windows">
Download and install a JDK (e.g., OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, Microsoft Build of OpenJDK).<br />
Set JAVA\_HOME and add JAVA\_HOME\bin to your PATH.

# iOS & macOS (Swift)
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/guides/languages/swift
Learn how to setup Cursor for Swift
Welcome to Swift development in Cursor! Whether you're building iOS apps, macOS applications, or server-side Swift projects, we've got you covered. This guide will help you set up your Swift environment in Cursor, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced features.
## Basic Workflow
The simplest way to use Cursor with Swift is to treat it as your primary code editor while still relying on Xcode for building and running your apps. You'll get great features like:
* Smart code completion
* AI-powered coding assistance (try [CMD+K](/cmdk/overview) on any line)
* Quick access to documentation with [@Docs](/context/@-symbols/@-docs)
* Syntax highlighting
* Basic code navigation
When you need to build or run your app, simply switch to Xcode. This workflow is perfect for developers who want to leverage Cursor's AI capabilities while sticking to familiar Xcode tools for debugging and deployment.
### Hot Reloading
When using Xcode workspaces or projects (instead of opening a folder directly in Xcode), Xcode can often ignore changes to your files that were made in Cursor, or outside of Xcode in general.
While you can open the folder in Xcode to resolve this, you may need to use a project for your Swift development workflow.
A great solution to this is to use [Inject](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Inject), a hot reloading library for Swift that allows your app to "hot reload" and update as soon as changes are made in real time. This does not suffer from the side effects of the Xcode workspace/project issue, and allows you to make changes in Cursor and have them reflected in your app immediately.
<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Inject - Hot Reloading for Swift" horizontal icon="fire" href="https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Inject">
Learn more about Inject and how to use it in your Swift projects.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
## Advanced Swift Development
<Note>This section of the guide was heavily inspired by [Thomas Ricouard](https://x.com/Dimillian) and his [article](https://dimillian.medium.com/how-to-use-cursor-for-ios-development-54b912c23941) about using Cursor for iOS development. Please check his article for more details and drop him a follow for more Swift content.</Note>
If you are looking to only need one editor open at a time, and want to avoid the need to switch between Xcode and Cursor, you can use an extension like [Sweetpad](https://sweetpad.hyzyla.dev/) to integrate Cursor directly with Xcode's underlying build system.
Sweetpad is a powerful extension that allows you to build, run and debug your Swift projects directly in Cursor, without compromising on Xcode's features.
To get started with Sweetpad, you'll still need to have Xcode installed on your Mac - it's the foundation of Swift development. You can download Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). Once you have Xcode set up, let's enhance your development experience in Cursor with a few essential tools.
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
# Builds your projects without needing Xcode open
brew install xcode-build-server
# Pretty print's the `xcodebuild` command output into Cursor's terminal
brew install xcbeautify
# Allows for advanced formating and language features
brew install swiftformat
```
Next, install the [Swift Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang) extension in Cursor. This will give you syntax highlighting and basic language features right out of the box.
Then, we can install the [Sweetpad](https://sweetpad.hyzyla.dev/) extension to integrate Cursor with Xcode. Sweetpad wraps a bunch of shortcuts around the `xcodebuild` CLI (and much more), and allows you to scan your targets, select the destination, build, and run your app just like Xcode. On top of that, it’ll set up your project for Xcode Build Server so you get all the features mentioned above.
### Sweetpad Usage
Once Sweetpad is installed, and you have a Swift project open in Cursor, you should first run the `Sweetpad: Generate Build Server Config` command. This will generate a `buildServer.json` file in the root of your project that allows the Xcode Build Server to work with your project.
Then, from either the Command Palette or the Sweetpad sidebar, you can select the target you want to build and run.
<Note> You need to build your project once to enable auto-completion, jump to definition, and other language features. </Note>
You can also now hit F5 to build and run your project with a debugger - you might need to create a launch configuration first, but just select Sweetpad from the list when prompted!
As with many extensions in Cursor, you can bind many of the Sweetpad commands to keyboard shortcuts, to make your workflow even more efficient.

# Migrate from JetBrains IDEs
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/guides/migration/jetbrains
Learn how to customize Cursor to replicate your JetBrains IDE experience
Cursor offers a modern, AI-powered coding experience that can replace your JetBrains IDEs. While the transition might feel different at first, Cursor's VS Code-based foundation provides powerful features and extensive customization options.
## Editor Components
### Extensions
JetBrains IDEs are great tools, as they come already pre-configured for the languages and frameworks they are intended for.
Cursor is different - being a blank canvas out of the box, you can customize it to your liking, not being limited by the languages and frameworks the IDE was intended for.
Cursor has access to a vast ecosystem of extensions, and almost all of the functionality (and more!) that JetBrains IDEs offer can be recreated through these extensions.
Take a look at some of these popular extensions below:
<CardGroup cols={4}>

# AI Commit Message
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/more/ai-commit-message
Learn how to generate Git commit messages automatically in Cursor using the sparkle icon or shortcuts
Cursor can help you generate meaningful commit messages for your changes with just a click. Here's how to use this feature:
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/features/generate-commit-message.png" />
</Frame>
1. Stage the files you want to commit
2. Open the Git tab in the sidebar
3. Look for the sparkle (✨) icon next to the commit message input field
4. Click the sparkle icon to generate a commit message based on your staged changes
The generated commit message will be based on the changes in your staged files and your repository's git history. This means Cursor will analyze both your current changes and previous commit messages to generate a contextually appropriate message. Cursor learns from your commit history, which means if you use conventions like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), the generated messages will follow the same pattern.
## Shortcut
You can bind the generate commit message feature to a keyboard shortcut.
1. Go to Keyboard Shortcuts `⌘R ⌘S` or `⌘⇧P` and search for "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
2. Add the following to the file to bind to `⌘M`:
```json
{
"key": "cmd+m",
"command": "cursor.generateGitCommitMessage"
}
```
3. Save the file and you're done!
<Info>
Currently, there isn't a way to customize or provide specific instructions for
how commit messages should be generated. Cursor will automatically adapt to
your existing commit message style.

# Custom API Keys
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/settings/api-keys
Learn how to use your own API keys in Cursor for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Azure LLM providers
Cursor lets you input your own API keys for various LLM providers to send as many AI messages as you want at your own cost. When a Customer API key is used, we will use that when calling the LLM providers.
To use your own API key, go to `Cursor Settings` > `Models` and enter your API keys. Then, click on the "Verify" button. Once your key is validated, your API key will be enabled.
<Warning>
Some Cursor features like Tab Completion
require specialized models and won't work with custom API keys. Custom API
keys only work for features that use standard models from providers like
OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
</Warning>
## OpenAI API Keys
You can get your own API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
<Warning>
OpenAI's reasoning models (o1, o1-mini, o3-mini) require special configuration and are not currently supported with custom API keys.
</Warning>
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/misc/openai-api.png" />
</Frame>
## Anthropic API Keys
Similar to OpenAI, you can also set your own Anthropic API key so that you will be using claude-based models at your own cost.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/misc/anthropic-api.png" />
</Frame>
## Google API Keys
For Google API keys, you can set your own API key so that you will be using Google models such as `gemini-1.5-flash-500k` at your own cost.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/misc/google-api.png" />
</Frame>
## Azure Integration
Finally, you can also set your own Azure API key so that you will be using Azure OpenAI models at your own cost.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/misc/azure-api.png" />
</Frame>
## FAQ
### Will my API key be stored or leave my device?
Your API key will not be stored, but it will be sent up to our server with every request. All requests are routed through our backend where we do the final prompt building.
### What custom LLM providers are supported?
Cursor only supports API providers that are compatible with the OpenAI API format (like OpenRouter). We do not provide support for custom local LLM setups or other API formats. If you're having issues with a custom API setup that isn't from our supported providers, we unfortunately cannot provide technical support.

Switch between AI models in Cursor using Chat, Composer, Tab, or Agent with different pricing tiers
With Composer, ⌘ K, and Terminal Ctrl/⌘ K, you can easily switch between different models of your choice.
## Model usage
Cursor has two types of models:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Premium models" icon="crown">
These models are usually **more intelligent** and count against your monthly request usage.
</Card>
<Card title="Free models" icon="bolt">
These models are usually **faster** to respond, and have **unlimited usage** on all our paid plans.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
If you exceed your monthly premium model quota, you can enable usage based pricing to continue using these models.
For more information on model usage and quotas, see [Account Usage](/account/usage).
## Available models

### MAX mode
Models offered in MAX mode have enhanced capabilities with larger context windows and expanded reasoning.
Currently offered as an option for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, MAX mode provides a 200k token context window, 200 Agent tool call limit, and the ability to process up to 750 lines per file read operation.
When operated as an Agent, each tool call in MAX mode is charged as a separate request in addition to the initial prompt request.
### Model hosting
Models are hosted on US-based infrastructure by the model's provider, a trusted partner or Cursor.
When **Privacy Mode** is enabled from Settings, Cursor nor the model providers will store your data with all data deleted after each request is processed. For further details see our [Privacy](/account/privacy), [Privacy Policy](https://cursor.com/privacy), and [Security](https://cursor.com/security) pages.
## Model dropdown
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/advanced/model-menu-auto-select.png" />
</Frame>
Underneath the AI input box in both the [Chat](/agent) and [CMD+K](/cmd-k/overview) modes, you will see a dropdown that allows you to select the model you want to use.
For any models not visible in the dropdown, you can enable and disable them in your Cursor Settings.
### Auto-select
Enabling the Auto-select switch in the model dropdown allows Cursor to proactively select the best model for your needs at that moment.
Cursor will select the **premium model** with the highest reliability based on current demand and best fit for the current task.
While this works best for keeping you in flow, you can also manually select a different model by disabling this option.
### Thinking
Enabling the Thinking switch in the model dropdown limits the list to models that engage in more deliberate reasoning when producing responses.
Thinking models work through problems step-by-step and have deeper capacity to examine their own reasoning and correct errors.
These models often perform better on complex reasoning tasks, though they may require more time to generate their responses.
## Context windows
The 'context window' is the amount of tokens that we provide the model with, for it to use in the conversation.
To optimize the AI performance, Cursor curates the context provided to the model to ensure the best experience.
In the [Agent](/agent), the context windows is 60,000 tokens by default. For Claude 3.7 specifically, the window is up to 120,000 tokens, due to it's better performance with longer context windows.
For [Cmd-K](/cmd-k/overview), we limit to around 10,000 tokens to balance speed and quality.
For longer conversations, we automatically summarize the context to preserve token space. Note that these threshold are changed from time to time to optimize the experience.
# Advanced Features

Learn to navigate code efficiently using Tab in peek views, prediction, and partial accepts
## Tab in Peek
You can also use Cursor Tab in the "Go to Definition" or "Go to Type Definition" peek views. This is useful, for example, when adding a new argument to a function call.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cpp/cpp-in-peek.png" />
</Frame>
We especially enjoy using this in vim in conjunction with `gd` to, for example, modify a function definition, then fix all of its usages in one go.
## <div className="flex items-center" style={{ gap: '6px' }}> <span className="cursor-pointer my-0">Cursor Prediction</span></div>
Cursor can also predict where you will go to after an accepted edit.
If available, you will be able to press tab to go to the next location, allowing you to tab-tab-tab through edits.
<Frame caption="Cursor predicted the next location, and suggested an edit there.">

</Frame>
## <div className="flex items-center" style={{ gap: '6px' }}> <span className="cursor-pointer my-0">Partial Accepts</span></div>
You can accept the next word of a suggestion by pressing `Ctrl/⌘` and the right arrow (or by setting `editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextWord` to your preferred keybinding).
To enable partial accepts, navigate to `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Cursor Tab`.
# Auto-import
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/tab/auto-import
Auto-import feature in Tab helps add module imports automatically in TypeScript and Python projects
## Overview
In TypeScript and Python (beta) project, Tab can automatically import modules and functions from elsewhere in your project, without you having to manually type the import statement.
Just start using the method you want from an existing file, and Tab will automatically suggest the import statement for you. If you accept, the import statement will be added to your file without pulling you away from the code you are writing.
## Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with auto-import, please confirm you have the necessary extensions (e.g. a language server) for your project language, as this is required for auto-import to work.
You can confirm if this is working, by moving your cursor to a function or method that is not yet imported, and hit <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> to see if the import is suggested in the Quick Fix suggestions - if not, then the language server is not working.
# Tab vs GitHub Copilot
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/tab/from-gh-copilot
Learn how Cursor's code editing capabilities surpass GitHub Copilot with multi-character & instructional edits
## Tab Improvements
The biggest difference is the way Cursor and GitHub Copilot complete code.
GitHub Copilot can insert text at your cursor position. It cannot edit the code around your cursor or remove text.
Cursor can insert text at your cursor, and much more:
* Multi-character edits
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cpp/multi-edit.png" />
</Frame>
* Instruction-based edits
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cpp/instruct.png" />
</Frame>
Further, Cursor has a history of your recent changes in the context window, so it knows what you are trying to do next.
## Migrate from GitHub Copilot
Since Cursor comes by default with GitHub Copilot, you might have GitHub Copilot and Cursor installed at the same time. We recommend turning off GitHub Copilot when you want to use Cursor.
By default, Cursor takes precedence over GitHub Copilot. If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you can [disable Cursor](/tab/overview#copilot-settings) in the settings.
# Overview
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview
AI-powered code autocomplete that suggests edits and multi-line changes based on your recent work
Cursor Tab is our native autocomplete feature. It's a more powerful Copilot that suggests entire diffs with especially good memory.
<Frame>
<video src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cpp/cpp-full-video.mp4" autoPlay loop muted playsInline />
</Frame>
Powered by a custom model, Cursor Tab can:
* Suggest edits around your cursor, not just insertions of additional code.
* Modify multiple lines at once.
* Make suggestions based on your recent changes and linter errors.
Free users receive 2000 suggestions at no cost. Pro and Business plans receive unlimited suggestions.
## UI
When Cursor is only adding additional text, completions will appear as grey text. If a suggestion modifies existing code,
it will appear as a diff popup to the right of your current line.
<Frame className="flex items-stretch justify-center">
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cpp/ghost-text-example.png" className="h-full object-cover" />
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/cpp/preview-box-example.png" className="h-full object-cover" />
</Frame>
You can accept a suggestion by pressing `Tab`, or reject it by pressing `Esc`. To partially accept a suggestion word-by-word, press `Ctrl/⌘ →`.
To reject a suggestion, just keep typing, or use `Escape` to cancel/hide the suggestion.
Every keystroke or cursor movement, Cursor will attempt to make a suggestion based on your recent changes. However, Cursor will not always show a suggestion; sometimes the model has predicted that there's no change to be made.
Cursor can make changes from one line above to two lines below your current line.
## Toggling
To turn the feature on or off, hover over "Cursor Tab" icon on the status bar in the bottom right of the application.
## Keyboard Shortcut
Bind Cursor Tab to a custom keyboard shortcut by selecting Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts from the Cursor menu and searching for `Accept Cursor Tab Suggestions`.
## FAQ
### Tab gets in the way when writing comments, what can I do?
You can disable Cursor Tab for comments by going to `Cursor Settings` > `Tab Completion` and unchecking "Trigger in comments".
# Common Issues
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/common-issues
Guide for troubleshooting common Cursor app issues including updates, login, and connectivity problems
While we strive to make Cursor as stable as possible, sometimes issues can arise. Below are some common issues and how to resolve them.
### Networking Issues (HTTP/2)
Cursor relies on the HTTP/2 protocol for many of it's AI features, due to it's ability to handle streamed responses. If HTTP/2 is not supported by your network, this can cause issues such as failure to index your code, and the inability to use Cursor's AI features.
This can be the case when on corpoorate networks, using VPNs, or using a proxy like Zscaler.
To resolve this, Cursor now comes with a HTTP/1.1 fallback, which is slower, but will allow you to use Cursor's AI features. You can enable this yourself in the app settings (not the Cursor settings), by pressing `CMD/CTRL + ,` and then searching for `HTTP/2`.
You should then enable the `Disable HTTP/2` option, which will force Cursor to use HTTP/1.1, and should resolve the issue.
We hope to add automatic detection and fallback in the future!
### Resource Issues (CPU, RAM, etc.)
Some users see high CPU or RAM usage in Cursor, which can cause their machine to slow down, or to show warnings about high RAM usage.
While Cursor can use a lot of resources when working on large codebases, this is usually not the case for most users, and is more likely to be an issue with Cursor's extensions or settings.
<Note>
If you are seeing a low RAM warning on **MacOS**, please note that there is a bug for some users that can show wildly incorrect values. If you are seeing this, please open the Activity Monitor and look at the "Memory" tab to see the correct memory usage.
</Note>
If you're experiencing high CPU or RAM usage in Cursor, here are steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Check Your Extensions">
While many extensions can be useful, some can significantly impact performance!
To test this, you can try to run `cursor --disable-extensions` from the command line to launch Cursor without any extensions enabled. If the performance improves, gradually re-enable extensions one by one to identify the problematic ones.
You can also try to use the Extension Bisect feature, which will help you identify which extension is causing the issue. You can read more about it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/02/16/extension-bisect#_welcome-extension-bisect), but note that this may only be useful if the issues are immediate and obvious, and not an issue that worsens over time.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use the Process Explorer">
The **Process Explorer** is a built in tool in Cursor that allows you to see which processes are consuming resources.
To open it, open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run the `Developer: Open Process Explorer` command.
This should open a new window, with a list of all the processes Cursor is running, both as part of it's own executation, as well as any processes needed to run extensions and any terminals you may have running. This should immediately identify any processes that are consuming a lot of resources.
If the process is listed under the **`extensionHost`** dropdown, this suggests an extension is causing the issue, and you should try to find and disable the problematic extension.
If the process is listended under the **`ptyHost`** dropdown, this suggests a terminal is consuming a lot of resources. The Process Explorer will show you each terminal that is running, and what command is running within it, so that you can try to kill it, or diagnose it's high resource usage.
If the usage is from another process, please let us know in the [forum](https://forum.cursor.com/) and we'll be happy to help diagnose the issue.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Monitor System Resources">
Depending on your operating system, you can use a number of different tools to monitor your system's resources.
This will help you identify if the issue is Cursor-specific, or if it's a system-wide issue.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Testing a Minimal Installation">
While the above steps should help the majority of users, if you are still experiencing issues, you can try testing a minimal installation of Cursor to see if the issue persists.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## General FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I see an update on the changelog but Cursor won't update">
If the update is very new, it might not have rolled out to you yet. We do staged rollouts, which means we release new updates to a few randomly selected users first before releasing them to everyone. Expect to get the update in a couple days!
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I have issues with my GitHub login in Cursor / How do I log out of GitHub in Cursor?">
You can try using the `Sign Out of GitHub` command from the command palette `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I can't use GitHub Codespaces">
Unfortunately, we don't support GitHub Codespaces yet.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I have errors connecting to Remote SSH">
Currently, we don't support SSHing into Mac or Windows machines. If you're not using a Mac or Windows machine, please report your issue to us in the [forum](https://forum.cursor.com/). It would be helpful to include some logs for better assistance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SSH Connection Problems on Windows">
If you encounter the error "SSH is only supported in Microsoft versions of VS Code", follow these steps:
1. Uninstall the current Remote-SSH extension:
* Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`)
* Search for "Remote-SSH"
* Click on the gear icon and select "Uninstall"
2. Install version 0.113 of Remote-SSH:
* Go to the Cursor marketplace
* Search for "Remote-SSH"
* Find version 0.113 and install it
3. After installation:
* Close all VS Code instances that have active SSH connections
* Restart Cursor completely
* Try connecting via SSH again
If you still experience issues, make sure your SSH configuration is correct and that you have the necessary SSH keys set up properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cursor Tab and Cmd K do not work behind my corporate proxy">
Cursor Tab and Cmd K use HTTP/2 by default, which allows us to use less resources with lower latency. Some corporate proxies (e.g. Zscaler in certain configurations) block HTTP/2. To fix this, you can set `"cursor.general.disableHttp2": true` in the settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,` and then search for `http2`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I just subscribed to Pro but I'm still on the free plan in the app">
Try logging out and logging back in from the Cursor Settings
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="When will my usage reset again?">
If you're subscribed to Pro you can click on `Manage Subscription` from the [Dashboard](https://cursor.com/settings) and your plan renewal date will be displayed at the top.
If you're a free user you can check when you got the first email from us in your inbox. Your usage will reset every month from that date.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My Chat/Composer history disappeared after an update">
If you notice that your Chat or Composer history has been cleared following an update, this is likely due to low disk space on your system. Cursor may need to clear historical data during updates when disk space is limited. To prevent this from happening:
1. Ensure you have sufficient free disk space before updating
2. Regularly clean up unnecessary files on your system
3. Consider backing up important conversations before updating
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I uninstall Cursor?">
You can follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/uninstall) to uninstall Cursor. Replace every occurrence of "VS Code" or "Code" with "Cursor", and ".vscode" with ".cursor".
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I delete my account?">
You can delete your account by clicking on the `Delete Account` button in the [Dashboard](https://cursor.com/settings). Note that this will delete your account and all data associated with it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I open Cursor from the command line?">
You can open Cursor from the command line by running `cursor` in your terminal. If you're missing the `cursor` command, you can
1. Open the command palette `⌘⇧P`
2. Type `install command`
3. Select `Install 'cursor' command` (and optionally the `code` command too which will override VS Code's `code` command)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to Sign In to Cursor">
If you click Sign In on the General tab of Cursor's Settings tab but are redirected to cursor.com and then return to Cursor still seeing the Sign In button, try disabling your firewall or antivirus software, which may be blocking the sign-in process.

# Getting a Request ID
Source: https://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/request-reporting
Learn how to find and share request IDs in Cursor for better technical support and issue reporting
When the Cursor team are investigating a technical issue, sometimes, we may ask you to provide us with a "request ID".
## What is a request ID?
A request ID is a unique identifier that is generated when you submit a request to Cursor. It is a string of characters that is used to identify the request in our internal systems.
It usually follows a randomized format, such as: `8f2a5b91-4d3e-47c6-9f12-5e8d94ca7d23`.
## How do I find a request ID?
<Warning>
Request IDs are highly limited when Privacy Mode is enabled, so we recommend disabling Privacy Mode when reporting an issue.
As a reminder, users on a business plan have Privacy Mode enabled by default, by their organization's admin.
</Warning>
### Getting your current request ID
If you are wanting to report an issue with your current or very recent conversation, you can do this in just a few clicks.
With the relevant conversation open in the Chat sidebar, you can use the context menu in the top right to see a few options - one of these options is the `Copy Request ID` option.
<Frame>
<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/requestIDpopup.png" />
</Frame>
After copying the request ID, you can send it back to us to look into, either via the forum, or by email if requested by our support team.
### Getting a request ID from a previous action
You can retrieve a historical request ID from within Cursor by running the `Report AI Action` command.
You you can do this by:
1. Opening the command palette `⌘⇧P`
2. Typing `Report AI Action`
3. Selecting the `Report AI Action` option
This will open a new popup, listing your most recent AI actions across Chat, CMD+K and Apply.
<Frame>
src="/images/requestIDlist.png"
/>
</Frame>
Select the action you want to report, by matching the time and feature the action was used in. Once you select the action, you have the option to copy the request ID to your clipboard. With it copied, you can send it back to us to look into!
# Troubleshooting Guide

Technical guide for gathering logs, errors and system info when reporting Cursor issues
Sometimes, Cursor may unexpectantly have some issues. This can be due to a number of reasons, including extensions, app data, or your system. While we work hard to ensure Cursor is as stable out of the box as possible, if these issues happen, you can try the following steps to resolve them.

</Card>
</CardGroup>
## Troubleshooting
### 1. Extension Data
If you are experiencing issues with individual extensions, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling them to reset any data they may have stored. Also check your settings to see if you have any configuration for the extensions that would remain after uninstalling and reinstalling them.
### 2. Clearing App Data
<Warning>
WARNING:<br />This will delete your app data, including your extensions, themes, snippets and any other data related to your installation. Consider exporting your profile to ensure this data is not lost.
</Warning>
To allow your installation to be restored between updates, and between reinstallation, Cursor keeps your app data outside of the app itself. This means that if you uninstall Cursor, you can reinstall it and it will restore your app data from the previous installation.
If you would like to clear your app data, you can do so by following these steps:
**Windows:** Run the following commands in Command Prompt:
```txt
rd /s /q %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\cursor*
rd /s /q %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Cursor*
rd /s /q %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Cursor*
rd /s /q %USERPROFILE%\cursor*
```
**MacOS:** Run `sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor` and `rm -f ~/.cursor.json` in Terminal.
**Linux:** Run `rm -rf ~/.cursor ~/.config/Cursor/` in Terminal.
### 3. Uninstalling Cursor
While we never want you to have to reinstall Cursor, if you are experiencing issues, this can sometimes help.
To uninstall the Cursor app, you can do the following:
<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card horizontal title="Windows" icon="windows">
Search for `Add or Remove Programs` Start Menu, find "Cursor" list, and click "Uninstall".
</Card>
<Card horizontal title="MacOS" icon="apple">
Open the Applications folder, find "Cursor" in the list, and right click and select "Move to Trash".
</Card>
<Card horizontal title="Linux" icon="linux">
Open the Applications folder, find "Cursor" in the list, and right click and select "Move to Trash".
</Card>
</CardGroup>
### 4. Reinstalling Cursor
If you have uninstalled Cursor, you can reinstall it by going to the [Downloads page](https://www.cursor.com/download) and downloading the latest version. If you have not cleared your app data, this should restore your app to the state it was in when you uninstalled it. Otherwise, you will have an entirely fresh install of Cursor.
