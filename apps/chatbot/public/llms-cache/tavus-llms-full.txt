# Create Conversation
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation

post /v2/conversations
With the Tavus Conversational Video Interface (CVI) you are able to create a `conversation` with a replica in real time.

### Conversations
A `conversation` is a video call with a replica. 

After creating a `conversation`, a `conversation_url` will be returned in the response. The `conversation_url` can be used to join the conversation directly or can be embedded in a website. To embed the `conversation_url` in a website, you can find [instructions here](https://www.daily.co/products/prebuilt-video-call-app/quickstart/).

Once a conversation is created, the replica will automatically join the call and will start participating.

By providing a `callback_url`, you can receive webhooks with updates regarding the conversation state.

[Learn about recording conversations here](/sections/conversational-video-interface/recording-rooms).

# Create Persona
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/personas/create-persona

post /v2/personas
Create and customize a digital replica's personality for Conversational Video Interface (CVI). A persona defines the replica's behavior and capabilities through configurable layers including:

**Core Components:**
- Replica - Choice of audio/visual appearance 
- Context - Customizable contextual information, for use by LLM 
- System Prompt - Customizable system prompt, for use by LLM
- Layers
  - STT - Transcription, turn taking, and Sparrow-0 settings 
  - LLM - Language model settings 
  - TTS - Text-to-Speech settings
  {/*- STS - Speech-to-Speech settings*/}
  - Perception - Multimodal vision and understanding settings (Raven-0)

When creating a conversation, the persona configuration determines how the replica interacts, processes information, and responds to participants. Each layer can be fine-tuned to achieve the desired conversational experience.

# Create Replica
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/create-replica

post /v2/replicas
This endpoint creates a new Replica that can be used to generate personalized videos. 

By default, all new replicas will be trained using the `phoenix-3` model. You can optionally create phoenix-2 replicas by setting the `model_name` parameter to `phoenix-2`.

The only required body parameter is `train_video_url`. This url must be a download link such as a presigned S3 url. Please ensure you pass in a video that meets the [requirements](/sections/troubleshooting/training-video-size) for training.

Replica training will fail without the following consent statement being present at the beginning of the video:
> I, [FULL NAME], am currently speaking and consent Tavus to create an AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and sound like me.

Learn more about the consent statement [here](/sections/troubleshooting/consent-statement).

This endpoint generates a new video using a Replica and either a script or an audio file. 

The only required body parameters are `replica_id` and either `script` or `audio_file`. 

The `replica_id` is a unique identifier for the Replica that will be used to generate the video. The `script` is the text that will be spoken by the Replica in the video. If you would like to generate a video using an audio file instead of a script, you can provide `audio_url` instead of `script`. Currently, `.wav` and `.mp3` files are supported for audio file input.

If a `background_url` is provided, Tavus will record a video of the website and use it as the background for the video. If a `background_source_url` is provided, where the URL points to a download link such as a presigned S3 URL, Tavus will use the video as the background for the video. If neither are provided, the video will consist of a full screen Replica.

# Bring Your Own Audio (BYOA) | Replica & Video API

May 2024

We are excited to release this highly requested feature — Bring Your Own Audio (BYOA). Developers on all plans can now use any audio source, including natural audio recordings, to generate videos – offering more control over the video creation process.
Previously, generating a video required using our standard text-to-speech service to convert text scripts into audio. With BYOA, you can use audio that is in-house generated, from a preferred vendor, or directly-recorded natural audio.

#### How to Use BYOA:

BYOA is integrated with our `/videos` endpoint. Instead of submitting a `script` field, you can now provide an `audio_url` field with a link to an accessible S3 URL or other hosted audio file.
The video is then generated based on the provided audio.

#### Benefits of BYOA:

* **Customization and Experimentation:** Developers can experiment with different audio sources—from in-house audio to preferred vendors. This flexibility helps in understanding how variations in audio affect video generation
* **Enhanced User Experience:** Offer multiple audio options for your end-users, allowing them to select the preferred audio for their final video.
* **Authenticity and Control:** End-users can record natural audio to personalize their replicas, controlling tone and expression while still benefiting from eliminating concerns about physical appearance or camera setup.

See how it works in this demo

# Enhanced Error Messaging for Training Videos | Replica API

April 2024

We've updated the API to include detailed error messages in the response when a replica training fails. This allows you to directly surface these messages to your end users. They can now understand the reasons for a training failure and resubmit a corrected video without needing to contact support for troubleshooting.

#### Examples of training video errors, include:

* More than one face detected or obstructions present
* Video does not meet minimum duration requirement
* The video is not encoded using h.264, ensure it's an mp4 file encoded using h.264

***

# Auto QA for Training Videos | Replica API

April 2024

**Improved Success Rates and Training Efficiency:** We've optimized the replica training process by automatically selecting the longest stable segment from a user’s training video. This segment is used to train the replica, focusing on a minimum viable length rather than the entire video.

#### Benefits include:

* Higher success rates in replica training
* Reduced training duration
* Enhanced quality of replicas by excluding awkward movements in generated videos


# Creating a Conversation
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/creating-a-conversation



> Creating a conversation immediately starts accumulating usage.
>
> When you create a conversation CVI immediately starts running and the replica waits in the WebRTC/Daily room listening for your participant to join. Your billing/credit usage starts as soon as the conversation is creating and runs until the conversation timeout or when you end the conversation. This also uses up one of your concurrency spots.

# How do I create a conversation?

Once you have a persona you'd like to use or a replica, starting a conversation is easy. You can use the [Create Conversation](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation) endpoint to do so. Alternatively you can start a conversation on the developer app by visiting the [Create Conversation page](https://platform.tavus.io/conversations/create).

# What does creating a conversation do?

Creating a conversation is 'starting the call'. Imagine you create a Zoom call and join the meeting- that's what happens when you create a conversation.

1. A WebRTC/Daily room is created
2. The replica joins the room and waits for a participant to join
3. Starts the timers on duration/timeouts (see Call Time Settings)

In response to creating a conversation, you receive a meeting URL (that looks like this: [https://tavus.daily.co/ca980e2e](https://tavus.daily.co/ca980e2e)). You or your participant can directly join this link and be put into a video conferencing room where you can immediately start conversing with the replica. **However, you do not have to use this meeting UI.** You can create a completely custom UI or access the raw streams.

[Learn about how to customize Daily UI](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/client-sdk)

[Use our examples as a starting point](https://github.com/Tavus-Engineering/tavus-examples)

### What is Daily?

Daily is our WebRTC provider. You do not have to create a Daily account. We have partnered with Daily to allow you to get an end to end solution without having to worry about WebRTC. You can build a completely custom application with CVI while accessing the Daily streams like you would with WebRTC.

# What can I customize per conversation?

Conversation specific customizations are focused on allowing personalization of a conversation to a specific participant. As an example you might want to have a custom introduction per person, or change the language the replica is listening for and responds in. Meanwhile persona level configurations are settings or defaults applied to all conversations so you do not have to configure them each time, such as setting up your LLM.

Here are the things you can customize per conversation:

### Persona / Replica

In order to start a conversation you must provide a persona or replica. If you provide a replica with no persona, the default Tavus persona will be used. Providing a persona without a replica will use the default replica attached to the persona if it exists. Providing a replica ID will override the default one associated with the persona.

### Conversation Context

Conversation context is specific information or instructions for the LLM related to this conversation. For example it can contain information on who is joining the call as well as any specific information on the point of the call, background information or current information.

Example of conversation context:

> You are talking to Michael Seibel, who works at Y Combinator as a Group Partner and Managing Director of YC early stage. You are talking to him about your new startup idea for a pet rock delivery service. Get his advice and convince him to invest. It's Monday, October 7th here in SF and the weather is clear and a crisp 68 degrees.  Here's a little more about Michael: He joined YC in 2013 as a Part-time Partner and in 2014 as a full-time Group Partner. Michael also serves on the board of two YC companies, Reddit and Dropbox. He moved to the bay area in 2006, and was a co-founder and CEO of two Y Combinator startups Justin.tv/Twitch (2007 - 2011) and Socialcam (2011 - 2012). In 2012 Socialcam sold to Autodesk Inc. for `$60m` (link) and in 2014, under the leadership of Emmett Shear (CEO) and Kevin Lin (COO) Twitch sold to Amazon for `$970m` (link). Before getting into tech, Michael spent 2006 as the finance director for a US Senate campaign in Maryland. In 2005, he graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in political science. Today he spends the large majority of his free time cooking, reading, traveling, and going for long drives. Michael lives in San Francisco, CA with his wife Sarah, son Jonathan, and daughter Jessica. Michael can be direct but he is a giant teddy bear if you get to know him.

The conversation context will be appended to the system prompt and the persona context/knowledge base.

### Custom Greeting

When a participant joins the replica will say a greeting that you can customize. You can use this to personalize a welcome message for someone or prompt them to start a conversation.

By default the replica will say "Hey there, how's it going? What can I do for you today?".

### Language

You can customize what language CVI understands and speaks in. For example you could set the conversation to be in Spanish. Setting the language ensures the layers (ASR/TTS) are configured correctly to handle the language. If you are using your own TTS voice, you'll need to make ensure it supports the language you specify.

### Call time settings (max duration and timeouts)

You can specify duration and timeouts for conversations. This is important to prevent unnecessary usage that incurs billing and uses up your max concurrency spots, as well as makes sure your users only use the allocated time you provide them.

There are 3 timeouts you can configure:

* Max duration: The maximum duration of the call in seconds. The default max\_call\_duration is 3600 seconds (1 hour). Once the time limit specified by this parameter has been reached, the conversation will automatically shut down.
* Participant left timeout: The duration in seconds after which the call will be automatically shut down once the last participant leaves. Default is 0 seconds, meaning the call will shutdown immediately after all participants leave. Note that this includes all additional observers, participants, or clients which you may have added to the meeting.
* Participant absent timeout: Starting from conversation creation, the duration in seconds after which the call will be automatically shut down if no participant joins the call. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

### Green screen / Transparent Background

If enabled, the background of the replica will be replaced with a green screen (RGB values: \[0, 255, 155]). You can use WebGL on the frontend to make the green screen transparent or change its color.


# Creating a Persona
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/creating-a-persona



Personas are the 'character' or 'AI agent personality' and contain all of the settings and configuration for that character or agent. For example, you can create a persona for 'Tim the sales agent' or 'Rob the interviewer'. Personas are where you can customize the layers for CVI as well as prompt the LLM to give it a personality and context.

A persona consists of:

* **Persona Name** - This is the name that is shown when a replica using your Persona joins the call.
* **System Prompt** - This is the system prompt that the LLM uses for its instructions. Use this to include instructions on who the persona is and how you want them to behave.
* **Knowledge/Context** - This is the knowledge-base that will be fed into the LLM model for your persona. You can dump documentation, background, writing etc here.
* **Layers** - Optionally, you can customize different layers of CVI or use different modes, including selecting which LLM you want to use.
* **LLM** - By default personas use a Tavus optimized variation of Llama3.1 8B.
* **Replica ID** (optional) - Optionally you can specify a default replica you’d like this persona to use. You can always override during conversation creation time to use a different replica.

# How to Create a Persona

### Via the UI

> Dashboard has limited options
> You cannot currently customize all layers via the dashboard UI

Navigate to the [Tavus Platform](https://platform.tavus.io). On the sidebar click on Persona Library. Finally, click Create Persona.

### Via the API

You can use the [Create Persona](/api-reference/personas/create-persona) endpoint to create a persona. Learn more about how to customize layers in CVI Modes and Layers

# Creating Good Prompts

> Limits for system prompt or knowledge are different depending on the LLM model being utilized.

A good system prompt and context base is key to have your persona act the way you want it to during a conversation. Here are some things to keep in mind:

### System Prompt

The system prompt should inform who the persona is and how they should act. These are the persona's 'instructions'.

For the system prompt:

* Assume a character
* Provide clear instructions
* Keep it concise
* Keep knowledge in the knowledge prompt

Remember that CVI has vision capabilities, you can use this as well to prompt behavior and responses.
Here's an example of a simple, good system prompt:

> You are Tim, a replica created using Tavus. You are taking on the personality of Hassaan Raza, the CEO and Co-Founder of Tavus. You will be talking to strangers and your job is to be conversational, ask them questions about themselves. Be witty and charming. If you don’t know something, just say you’ll get back to them on that.

### Context / Knowledge-base

The context is the persona's 'knowledge base'. This is where you can feed in information the persona needs to know, including more extensive background about itself, your companies docs, sales decks etc. Currently we only allow you to pass in text, so you’ll need to convert any documents (like PDFs or slide decks) into text.

For the knowledge/context:

* Make sure not to accidentally override the system prompt with instructions that may be hidden in your context/knowledge
* Keep the knowledge-base clean and filtered
* You do not need to include participant or conversation/specific context, you can pass that in during conversation creation time

The Tavus orchestration system will automatically attempt to optimize and align with the selected LLM to optimize your persona for natural conversation.


# Custom LLM Onboarding
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/custom-llm-onboarding

You can integrate an OpenAI-compatible LLM to replace our existing options (`tavus-llama`, `tavus-gpt-4o`, `tavus-gpt-4o-mini`).

## Create Persona

To get started, you'll need to create a Persona that specifies your custom LLM. Here's an example Persona:

```json
{
    "system_prompt": "You are a storyteller. You like telling stories to people of all ages. Reply in brief utterances, and ask prompting questions to the user as you tell your stories to keep them engaged.",
    "context": "Here are some of your favorite stories: Little Red Riding Hood, The Ugly Duckling and The Three Little Pigs",
    "persona_name": "Mert the Storyteller",
    "layers": {
        "llm": {
            "model": "custom_model_here",
            "api_key": "example-api-key",
            "base_url": "open-ai-compatible-llm-http-endpoint",
            "tools": [<your-tools-here>],
            "speculative_inference": true,
        },
        "tts": {
            "api_key": "example-api-key",
            "tts_engine": "playht",
            "playht_user_id": "your-playht-user-id",
            "external_voice_id": "professional-voice-clone-id",
            "voice_settings": {} // can also leave the "voice_settings" attr out if you want to use default settings
            "tts_emotion_control": false
        },
        "perception": {
            "perception_model": "raven-0", // or "basic" for simpler vision capabilities
            "ambient_awareness_queries": ["Is the user showing an ID card?"],
        },
        "stt": {
            "participant_pause_sensitivity": "high",
            "participant_interrupt_sensitivity": "high",
            "smart_turn_detection": true,
            "stt_engine": "tavus-advanced"
        }
    }
}
```

`<persona created>, id: p234324a`

## Launch a Conversation

With this persona, if we were to launch a conversation:

```json
{
    "replica_id": "r123456789",
    "conversation_name": "My Conversation",
    "callback_url": "https://webhook.site/",
    "persona_id": "p234324a",
    "conversational_context": "You are talking to Maya, who is from Dallas, Texas. She likes a good mystery book, and her favorite author is Agatha Christie."
}
```

We will see user utterances coming into endpoint you provided with the `/chat/completions` suffix as the user speaks during a conversation.

If you set up a test webhook and set the `base_url` to point to that webhook's url, you can examine an incoming chat completion request. You may notice the conversation\_id is provided as a request header, and your API key can be used to authenticate requests coming onto your servers.

We make the chat completion request to the URL you provide with these settings:

```python
completion = self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model=custom_model_here,
    messages=context,
    extra_headers=self.extra_headers,
    stream=True,
    tools=tools
)
```

Which means your OpenAI compatible LLM should be configured to be streamable (ie. send back chunks of chat completions over SSE (Server-side events)). [Here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) is the OpenAI documentation on chat completions as a quick reference point on what to be returning in the request.

## Speculative Inference

The `speculative_inference` parameter activates speculative inference, a technique that can significantly reduce response times in speech-to-text and natural language processing applications. This can be configured in the Persona.

### Overview of Speculative Inference

Speculative inference is an advanced processing technique that allows AI systems to begin generating responses before all input data is available. In the context of speech recognition and natural language processing:

### Behavior

When `speculative_inference` is set to `true`:

The replica will not start to speak until it is confident the user is done speaking; meanwhile progressive transcriptions will be sent to the LLM layer, each one including prior transcriptions accumulating until the replica starts speaking.

### Benefits

* Significantly faster response times
* Improved user experience due to reduced latency
* More natural, conversational interaction

### Create a Persona with Speculative Inference

```json
{
    "system_prompt": "You are a storyteller. You like telling stories to people of all ages. Reply in brief utterances, and ask prompting questions to the user as you tell your stories to keep them engaged.",
    "context": "Here are some of your favorite stories: Little Red Riding Hood, The Ugly Duckling and The Three Little Pigs",
    "persona_name": "Mert the Storyteller",
    "layers": {
        "llm": {
            "model": "custom_model_here",
            "api_key": "example-api-key",
            "base_url": "open-ai-compatible-llm-http-endpoint",
            "speculative_inference": true,
        }
    }
}
```

`<persona created>, id: p234324a`

## Tools / Function Calling

You can pass in tools (function calls) to the LLM to enable it to perform tasks beyond just text generation. This is useful if you want to integrate external APIs or services into the LLM.

Here's a full example of a persona that includes a tool to get the current weather for a given location:

```json
{
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "context": "Help users get the weather for a given location.",
    "persona_name": "Weather Assistant",
    "layers": {
        "llm": {
            "model": "custom_model_here",
            "api_key": "example-api-key",
            "base_url": "open-ai-compatible-llm-http-endpoint",
            "tools": [
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "get_current_weather",
                        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
                        "parameters": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "location": {
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                                },
                                "unit": {
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                                },
                            },
                            "required": ["location"],
                        },

        }
    }
}
```

## Interactions with the perception model

Depending on which perception model you enable, your LLM should expect to receive system and user messages containing the perception information. These messages allow your custom LLM to injest the visual information and context from the conversation, synthesizing it seamlessly with the LLM's response.

### Raven-0 Perception model

If you enable the Raven-0 perception model, your LLM will receive the following system messages:

```
{
    "role": "system",
    "content": "<user_appearance>...</user_appearance> <user_emotions>...</user_emotions> <user_screenshare>...</user_screenshare>"
}
```

### Basic Perception model

If you enable the Basic perception model, your LLM will receive the following user messages (instead of a system message):

```
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "USER_SPEECH: ... VISUAL_SCENE: ..."
}
```

### Disabled Perception model

If you disable the perception model, your LLM will not receive any special

## LLM Abstractions

We have abstracted the system such that the LLM instructions receive 3 distinct "sub-instructions" that are concatenated together. Let's use storytelling as an example persona.

If my goal is to create a storyteller, I can do so with the combination of `system_prompt` (Persona), `context` (Persona) and `conversational_context` (Conversation).

* Now, system\_prompt  can be something along the lines of: `"You are a storyteller. You like telling stories to people of all ages."` This defines what a storyteller **is**.
* context is for what that storyteller focuses on: "Here are some of your favorite stories to tell: Little Red Riding Hood, The Ugly Duckling and The Three Little Pigs" This defines what a storyteller **has**.
* conversational\_context is for all the details that revolve around that specific interaction between the user & replica. Something like: `"You are talking to {user_name} (you may pass that in dynamically per conversation request). They are {x} years old. They like listening to {genre} stories."` This defines **who** the storyteller is talking to.

This allows you to create as many conversations as you want using the storyteller persona and not share conversation specific context, while also allowing you to create default system prompts on your end and create personas of varying contexts (crime novel storyteller, horror storyteller, children's storyteller etc).

This would populate the initial `system_prompt` of the chat completion request we send your way, and since we send the entire context each time, anything you have in the `system_prompt` persists. You may also completely parse the incoming request body and choose what to send your LLM, building your own abstraction in place of what we currently offer.


# Custom TTS Onboarding
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/custom-tts-onboarding

You can integrate a variety of third-party TTS providers (cartesia, elevenlabs, playht).

## Create Persona

To get started, you'll need to create a Persona that specifies your custom TTS. Here's an example Persona:

```json
{
    "system_prompt": "You are a storyteller. You like telling stories to people of all ages. Reply in brief utterances, and ask prompting questions to the user as you tell your stories to keep them engaged.",
    "context": "Here are some of your favorite stories: Little Red Riding Hood, The Ugly Duckling and The Three Little Pigs",
    "persona_name": "Mert the Storyteller",
    "layers": {
        "llm": {
            "model": "custom_model_here",
            "api_key": "example-api-key",
            "base_url": "open-ai-compatible-llm-http-endpoint"
        },
        "tts": {
            "api_key": "example-api-key",
            "tts_engine": "cartesia",
            "external_voice_id": "professional-voice-clone-id",
            "voice_settings": {
                "speed": "normal",
                "emotion": ["positivity:high", "curiosity"]
            },
            "tts_emotion_control": true,
            "tts_model_name": "sonic"
        },
        "perception": {
            "perception_model": "raven-0",
        }
    }
}
```

`<persona created>, id: p234324a`

## Launch a Conversation

With this persona, if we were to launch a conversation:

```json
{
    "replica_id": "r123456789",
    "conversation_name": "My Conversation",
    "callback_url": "https://webhook.site/",
    "persona_id": "p234324a",
    "conversational_context": "You are talking to Maya, who is from Dallas, Texas. She likes a good mystery book, and her favorite author is Agatha Christie."
}
```

This replica would use the voice you supplied during conversation.

If you've been using these TTS providers and have built up an extensive voice library with them, to bring over your own voices, simply provide the API key and the voice ID you want to associate this Persona with. We will custodially connect to these TTS providers on your behalf, minimizing latency and providing a seamless experience.

The Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is an end-to-end pipeline for creating real-time multimodal video conversations with a replica that can see, hear, and respond similarly to how a human would. Developers can deploy video AI agents in minutes using CVI.

CVI is the world's fastest interface of its kind, allowing you to put a human face and conversational ability to your AI agent or personality. With CVI, you can achieve utterance-to-utterance latency with SLAs as fast as under 1 second, which is the full roundtrip time for a participant to say something and for the replica to speak back.

CVI provides a complete pipeline to have a conversation while also allowing you to customize and plug in your existing components where necessary.

## What components does CVI provide, and what can I customize?

CVI provides a full pipeline allowing you to easily create video conversations. You can immediately jump into a real-time conversation with the generated Daily meeting URL. CVI provides the following layers:

* WebRTC/video conferencing (using Daily)
* Speech recognition (ASR), with interrupts, and Semantic/Lexical turn taking, using our Sparrow-0 model.
* Perception (Raven-0)
* Optimized, conversational LLM
* Text-to-speech (TTS)
* Replica video output

You can choose to customize or bring your own layers as well. For example, you can:

* Use OpenAI real-time API or other voice-to-voice models and only use Tavus to drive the replica video.
* Bring your own LLM/conversation logic or enable function calling for Tavus-optimized LLMs.
* Customize the TTS or ASR engine, and turn taking settings, turn on/off Sparrow-0 smart turn detection
* Use text parrot mode to directly drive a replica video.
* Directly access the video streams and create a custom UI.

Learn more about the layers and different modes in [CVI Modes and Layers](/sections/conversational-video-interface/modes-and-layers).

## Key Concepts

### What is a conversation?

A conversation is a single 'session' or 'call' with a replica using CVI. When you create a conversation, you receive a Daily meeting URL. This URL provides a full video conferencing solution, allowing you to avoid managing WebRTC or websockets. Navigating to this URL lets you directly join a prebuilt meeting room UI to chat with your replica.

Learn more about [creating and customizing conversations](/sections/conversational-video-interface/creating-a-conversation).

### What are personas?

Personas are the 'character' or 'AI agent personality' and contain all the settings and configuration for that character or agent. For example, you can create a persona for 'Tim the Sales Agent' or 'Rob the Interviewer'. Personas let you customize CVI's layers and prompt the LLM with personality and context.

Learn more about [creating a persona](/sections/conversational-video-interface/creating-a-persona).

### What are replicas?

A replica is a talking-head/avatar of a human containing a voice and face clone, used as the video output layer for CVI. You can use stock replicas from Tavus or create your own with a few minutes of training data. A replica is key for video generation and CVI.

Learn how to [create a great replica](/sections/conversational-video-interface/creating-a-replica).

## Getting Started

### No Code

You can easily try out CVI using the [Tavus dashboard](https://platform.tavus.io). Note that not all settings and modes are available via the dashboard.

### API Quick Start

Check out the [Quick Start Guide](/sections/conversational-video-interface/quickstart) to learn how to use the APIs to create a persona and conversation. Be sure to grab an API key first!

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I tell what’s happening in the stream/room as a developer?">
    * Be sure to specify a `callback_url` when creating a conversation. Tavus will return conversation updates to this URL via webhook. Example updates include `replica_joined`, `shutdown`, and `transcript_ready`. For more details check out [conversation callbacks](/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation-callbacks). We also additionally broadcast a variety of realtime events through the App Message layer through our [Interactions Protocol](/api-reference/interactions-protocol) that can be listened to by a Daily call client.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did the conversation end so quickly and suddenly?">
    * The default `max_call_duration` is just 4 minutes (240 seconds). It is recommended to update this in the [create conversation](api-reference/create-conversation) call.
    * The `max_call_duration` is a clock that starts on conversation **creation**, not when a replica or participant joins.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I record a conversation?">
    * To record a conversation, you need to...

    1. Enable the recording feature by setting the `enable_recording` property to `true`. This will allow the conversation to be recorded.
    2. Specify the S3 bucket where the recording will be stored by setting the `recording_s3_bucket_name` and `recording_s3_bucket_region` properties.
    3. If your setup requires assuming a specific AWS role to access the S3 bucket, make sure to provide the ARN of the role in the `aws_assume_role_arn` property.

    These configurations will ensure that your conversation is recorded and securely stored in the designated S3 bucket.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I bring my own TTS (Text-to-Speech)?">
    To bring your own Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, you need to create a [Persona](api-reference/create-persona) and configure its `tts` object. Here’s how you can do it:

    1. API Key (api\_key): Provide the custodial API key for the TTS provider of your choice. This key will be used to authenticate requests to the TTS engine.
    2. TTS Engine (tts\_engine): Select the TTS engine you want to use. Currently, the supported engines are:

    * `cartesia`
    * `elevenlabs`
    * `playht`

    You should specify one of these options based on your provider.

    3. External Voice ID (external\_voice\_id): If you want to use a specific voice from the TTS provider, provide the corresponding voice ID here. This ID must be valid and associated with the chosen TTS engine.
    4. Voice Settings (voice\_settings): If you want to customize the voice settings for the TTS engine, you can provide a `voice_settings` object. This object contains settings such as `speed` and `emotion` that you can use to customize the voice of the TTS engine. Documentation for the supported engines can be found in their respective onboarding guides
    5. Playht User ID (playht\_user\_id): If you are using the Playht TTS engine, you will need to provide your Playht user ID here. This ID is required to authenticate your requests to the Playht API.
    6. TTS Emotion Control (tts\_emotion\_control): If you want to control the emotion of the voice, you can set this to `true`. This is only available for Cartesia TTS.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What LLM (Large Language Model) does Tavus use to power the conversational replicas?">
    Tavus offers flexibility in choosing the LLM (Large Language Model) to power your conversational replicas. You can either use one of Tavus's own models or bring your own!

    * **No LLM Layer:** If you don't include an LLM layer, Tavus will automatically default to a Tavus-provided model.
    * **Tavus-Provided LLMs:** You can choose between three different models:
      * **tavus-gpt-4o:** The smartest option for complex interactions.
      * **tavus-gpt-4o-mini:** A hybrid model that balances performance and intelligence.
      * **tavus-llama:** The **default** choice if no LLM layer is provided. This is the fastest model, offering the best user-to-user (U2U) experience. It’s on-premise, making it incredibly performant.

    This allows you to tailor the conversational experience to your specific needs, whether you prioritize speed, intelligence, or a balance of both.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I bring my own LLM (Large Language Model)?">
    To bring your own Large Language Model (LLM), you need to create a [Persona](api-reference/create-persona) and configure its `llm` layer.

    * **Compatibility:** Your custom LLM must be compatible with the OpenAI API standards. This means it should be able to process API requests in the same format as OpenAI’s models, ensuring smooth integration.

    For detailed instructions, see [Custom LLM Onboarding](/sections/conversational-video-interface/custom-llm-onboarding)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are some recording tips for producing high quality conversational replica training footage?">
    When recording footage for training conversational replicas, here are some key tips to ensure high quality:

    1. Minimal Head Movement: Aim to keep your head and body as still as possible during the recording. This helps in maintaining consistency and improves the overall quality of the training data.
    2. Pause and Be Still: It’s recommended to stop, stay still, and remain silent for at least 5 seconds at regular intervals throughout the script. These pauses are crucial for helping the replica appear natural during moments of silence in a conversation.
    3. Use a Laptop Camera: Recording on a laptop camera, as if you were on a Zoom call, often yields the most natural results. This setup mimics a familiar conversational setting, enhancing the naturalness of the footage.

# Layers and Modes Overview
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/layers-and-modes-overview



CVI provides an end-to-end pipeline that takes in a user audio & video input and outputs a realtime replica AV output. This pipeline is hyper optimized, with layers tightly coupled to achieve the lowest latency in the market. CVI is highly customizable though, with the ability to customize or disable layers as well as different modes being offered to best fit your use case.

<Tip>By default we always recommend to use as much of the CVI end-to-end pipeline as possible to guarantee the lowest latency and provide the best experience for your customers.</Tip>

## Layers

Tavus provides the following customizable layers as part of the CVI pipeline:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transport" icon="right-left">
    * Video conferencing / end-to-end WebRTC, currently powered by Daily. It handles audio/visual input and output for CVI.
    * We allow configurability for input and output, each with either audio/mic or visual/camera property. You can never disable the Transport layer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Perception" icon="eye">
    User input video / screenshare can be processed using Raven-0, our advanced multimodal perception system, allowing the replica to see and respond to user expressions, environments and the content on screen. See more details for [Raven](/sections/conversational-video-interface/raven).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Speech Recognition with Sparrow-0 (Semantic Interrupts)" icon="ear-listen">
    An optimized ASR system powered by Sparrow-0, enabling incredibly fast and intelligent interrupts with real-time lexical and semantic analysis for precise, natural turn-taking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="LLM" icon="brain">
    Tavus provides ultra-low latency optimized LLMs or allows you to bring your own.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="TTS" icon="volume-high">
    Tavus provides the TTS audio using a low-latency optimized voice model (powered by Cartesia), or allows you to use one of the other supported voice providers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Realtime Replica" icon="face-smile">
    Tavus provides high-quality streaming replicas powered by our proprietary class of models: *Phoenix*.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pipeline Modes

Tavus offers a number of modes that come with preconfigured layers as necessary for your use case. You can configure the pipeline mode in the [Create Persona API](https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/personas/create-persona).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Full" icon="star">
    Default and recommended option to optimize your multimodal interactions or enable Perception.

    You have the option to bring your own ASR / LLM / TTS.
  </Accordion>

  {/*<Accordion title="Speech to Speech" icon="wave-square">
          Tavus provides the option to bypass ASR, LLM, and TTS with Speech to Speech model.

          You may use your own or integrate with our native implementation (OpenAI Realtime API).

          - If you'd like to use the Realtime API with your own API key for billing purposes, you may do so.
          - If you do bring your own speech-to-speech implementation, it has to be Realtime API compatible in the events we send and receive from your websocket. More details for BYOSTS (Bring your own Speech-to-Speech) coming out soon!
        </Accordion>*/}

  <Accordion title="Echo" icon="microphone-lines">
    You can bypass Tavus Perception, ASR, turn-taking, and LLM and directly stream:

    * Text into the TTS layer (text echo), or...
    * Audio stream that the replica will repeat (audio echo). Audio stream can be a direct user mic input or base64.

    You can also use this mode server-to-server, where your server connects to the Daily/webRTC room to provide audio and then forwards the video stream to your user.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Full Pipeline Mode (default and recommended)

![Full Pipeline](https://cdn.zappy.app/e9d90f6c342e4aa44d16520b799c1075.png)

By default, we recommend using the end-to-end pipeline in it's entirety as it will provide the lowest latency and most optimized multimodal experience. We offer a number of LLMs (Llama3.1, OpenAI) that we've optimized within the end-to-end pipeline. With SLAs as fast as under 1s ---- you can access the world's fastest utterance-to-utterance latency. You can load our LLMs full of your knowledge base and prompt them to your liking, as well as update the context live to simulate an async RAG application.

### Custom LLM / Bring your own logic

![Custom LLM](https://cdn.zappy.app/1944a3c61e51081fa2dd202b808d5be6.png)

Using a custom LLM is a great idea for those that already have a LLM or are building business logic that needs to intercept the input transcription and decide on the output. Using your own LLM will likely add latency, as the Tavus LLMs are hyper-optimized for low latency.

Note that the 'Custom LLM' mode doesn't require an actual LLM. Any endpoint that will respond to chat completion requests in the required format can be used. For example, you could set up a server that takes in the completion requests and responds with predetermined responses, with no LLM involved at all.

[Learn about how to use Custom LLM mode](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/custom-llm-onboarding)

{/*### Speech to Speech Mode

  ![Speech to Speech](https://cdn.zappy.app/98c2d0fb456066b7a4a45e672765b7c5.png)

  The Speech to Speech pipeline mode allows you to bypass ASR, LLM, and TTS by leveraging an external speech to speech model. You may use Tavus speech to speech model integrations or you may bring your own.

  Note that in this mode perception capabilities from Tavus will be disabled, as there is nowhere to send the context to for now.

  [Learn about how to use Speech to Speech mode](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/modes/speech-to-speech-quickstart)*/}

### Echo Mode

You can specify audio or text input for the replica to speak out. We only recommend this if your application does not have a need for speech recognition (voice) or perception capabilities, or have a very specific ASR/Perception pipeline that you must use. Using your own ASR is most often slower and less optimized than using the integrated Tavus pipeline.

You can use text or audio input interchangeably in Echo Mode. There are two possible configurations, based on microphone enablement in Transport layer.

[Learn about how to use Echo Mode](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/modes/echo-mode-quickstart)

#### Text or Audio (Base64) Echo

![Text or Audio (Base64) Echo](https://cdn.zappy.app/55a19827cca5e99cbc14894141aa006c.png)

By turning off the microphone in the Transport Layer and using the Interactions Protocol, you can achieve Text and Audio (base64) echo behavior.

* The Text Echo behavior allows you to bypass Tavus Perception, ASR, turn-taking, and LLM and directly send text into the TTS layer. This allows you to have a replica that speaks all the text you provide, as well as allows you to manually control interrupts.

* The Audio (Base64) Echo behavior allows you to bypass all Layers except for the Realtime Replica Layer. In this configuration, the replica will speak the audio that you provide.

In order to send text or base64 encoded audio, you should use the [Interactions Protocol](https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/interactions-protocol).

#### Microphone Echo

![Microphone Echo](https://cdn.zappy.app/29b50c321276fcb745e4fa7d5f66badb.png)

By keeping the microphone on in the Transport Layer, you are able to bypass all layers in CVI and directly pass in an audio stream that the replica will repeat. In this mode interrupts are handled within your audio stream, any received audio will be generated with the replica.

We only recommend this if you have pre-generated audio you would like to use, have a voice-to-voice pipeline, or have a very specific voice requirement.


# Interactions Protocol Overview
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/live-interactions



The Interactions Protocol allows users to interact dynamically with the Replica live during an active conversation via broadcasting `interactions`.
The following interactions are available:

* Echo interactions
* Response interactions
* Interrupt interactions
* Sensitivity adjustment interactions
* Override conversation context interactions
* Sensitivity interactions

In addition to `interactions`, users are able to listen to incoming `events` from the Replica. Specifically you can listen for:

* Utterance events
* Tool call events
* Perception tool call events
* Perception analysis events
* Replica started / stopped speaking events

# Setting up Interactions Protocol

The interactions protocol uses the data-channel on WebRTC (Daily) in order to transmit and receive events between your server and CVI.

In order to use the interactions protocol, you must have a client that can connect to the data channel. We use Daily as our WebRTC provider, which makes it easy to setup a client.

The Daily `app-message` event is used to send and receive events and interactions between your server and CVI.

Here's an example of using [DailyJS](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/daily-call-client) to create a call client in Javascript:

```Javascript
<html>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/@daily-co/daily-js"></script>
  <body>
    <!-- Add input field and send button -->
    <input type="text" id="messageInput" placeholder="Enter your message">
    <button onclick="sendAppMessage()">Send Message</button>

    <script>
      call = window.Daily.createFrame();
      call.on('app-message', (event) => {
        console.log('app-message', event);
      });
      
      call.join({ url: 'YOUR_CONVERSATION_URL' });

      function sendAppMessage() {
        const messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput');
        const message = messageInput.value;
        if (message) {
          const interaction = {
            "message_type": "conversation",
            "event_type": "conversation.echo",
            "conversation_id": "YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID",
            "properties": {
              "text": `${message}`
            }
          }
          const hi = call.sendAppMessage({message: interaction }, '*');
          console.log('Sending message: ', hi);
          console.log('Sent message: ', interaction);
          messageInput.value = '';
        }
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's an example of using [Daily Python](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-python) to create a call client in Javascript:

```Python
call_client = None

class RoomHandler(EventHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
    
    def on_app_message(self, message, sender: str) -> None:
        print(f"Incoming app message from {sender}: {message}")

def join_room(url):
    global call_client
    try:
        Daily.init()
        output_handler = RoomHandler()
        call_client = CallClient(event_handler=output_handler)
        call_client.join(url)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error joining room: {e}")
        raise

def send_message(message):
    global call_client
    call_client.send_app_message(message)
```

# Pipecat Integration
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/pipecat



Tavus offers integration with Pipecat, an open-source framework for building multimodal conversational agents by Daily. You can easily add Tavus Replicas to your Pipecat apps and give them a video layer.

You can keep your Pipecat workflow as-is and just add the new `TavusVideoService`. To get started, you can follow the following steps or learn more from this [sample code](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/examples/foundational/21-tavus-layer.py).

## Step 1: Setup Tavus Replica

First, you need to set up TavusVideoService with your replica and persona.

```
tavus = TavusVideoService(
            api_key=os.getenv("TAVUS_API_KEY"),
            replica_id=os.getenv("TAVUS_REPLICA_ID"),
            persona_id=os.getenv("TAVUS_PERSONA_ID", "pipecat0"),
            session=session,
        )
```

## Step 2: Ignore Tavus Replica’s Microphone

Once Tavus Replica is added to the Daily room, you need to ignore its microphone. To do that, you need to get persona and look up persona\_name.

```
persona_name = await tavus.get_persona_name()
```

You can then ignore their microphone.

```
if participant.get("info", {}).get("userName", "") == persona_name:
  logger.debug(f"Ignoring {participant['id']}'s microphone")
  await transport.update_subscriptions(
    participant_settings={
    participant["id"]: {
    "media": {"microphone": "unsubscribed"},
    }
  }
)
```

## Step 3: Initiate the Conversation

Once your user enters the Daily room, you can kick off the conversation.

```
if participant.get("info", {}).get("userName", "") != persona_name:
  messages.append(
    {"role": "system", "content": "Please introduce yourself to the user."}
  )
  await task.queue_frames([LLMMessagesFrame(messages)])
```


# Quick Start
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/quick-start

This guide will walk you through the steps to quickly test out the API and start a conversation.

We will start with a stock replica and persona. You'll be using the stock replica ID `re8e740a42` (Nathan) and stock persona ID `p24293d6` (Celebrity DJ). You can run this directly in the [API documentation](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation) interface after entering your API key.

#### Step 1: Create a Conversation

1. **Endpoint:** [`POST /v2/conversations`](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation)

2. **Description:** This endpoint creates a new joinable conversation with the specified replica and persona. You can add a custom conversational context to make the interaction more personalized and fun.

   * **Conversational Context:** This is an additional context that you can provide on top of the existing context in the persona. It's a way to refine or make the conversation more specific for a particular session. For example, you can provide your favorite band or musical style as the conversational context to make the conversation more personalized.

3. **Request Body Example with Personalized Conversational Context:**

```json
{
  "replica_id": "re8e740a42",
  "persona_id": "p24293d6",
  "conversation_name": "Music Chat with DJ Kot",
  "conversational_context": "Talk about the greatest hits from my favorite band, Daft Punk, and how their style influenced modern electronic music.",
  "properties": {
    "enable_recording": true
  }
}
```

* **Explanation:** In this example, the `conversational_context` is set to focus on the user's favorite band, Daft Punk. This context will be used in addition to the persona's default context, making the conversation more tailored and engaging.

4. **Response:** The API will return a JSON object with details about the conversation, including a `conversation_url` that you can use to join the conversation.

#### Step 2: Join the Conversation

* **Response Example:**

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "abc123",
  "conversation_name": "Music Chat with DJ Kot",
  "status": "active",
  "conversation_url": "https://yourapi.com/conversations/abc123/join",
  "replica_id": "re8e740a42",
  "persona_id": "p24293d6",
  "created_at": "2024-08-13T12:34:56Z"
}
```

* **Join the Conversation:** Use the `conversation_url` to join the conversation directly.

<Note>The conversation will timeout and end after 4 minutes by default.</Note>

### Extra Credit!

* **Experiment with Different Combinations:** Don’t hesitate to mix and match different Replicas and Personas, along with varying contexts. For example, try pairing a [different Replica](sections/replicas/stock-replicas) with the Celebrity DJ persona and see how the conversation changes when you switch the context to discuss classical music or underground hip-hop. This experimentation can lead to unique and surprising interactions.

Enjoy exploring the diverse possibilities and have fun creating dynamic conversations!


# Perception with Raven
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/raven



Raven-0 is a revolutionary real-time multimodal vision and video understanding system that fundamentally reimagines how AI perceives and interacts with humans. Unlike traditional systems that rely on frame-by-frame analysis, Raven-0 implements a context-aware, human-like perception system that mirrors the primary visual cortex's functioning.

<Tip>By default we always recommend to use as much of the CVI end-to-end pipeline as possible to guarantee the lowest latency and provide the best experience for your customers.</Tip>

## Key Capabilities

Raven-0 provides advanced perception capabilities that go far beyond traditional vision systems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Contextual Awareness" icon="clock">
    Raven-0 continuously analyzes video streams to maintain ambient context, allowing for more natural and responsive interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multimodal Understanding" icon="layer-group">
    Process and understand multiple input channels simultaneously, including webcam feeds and screen sharing, creating a comprehensive understanding of the interaction context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Human-like Emotion Understanding" icon="face-smile">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool Calling Integration" icon="wrench">
    Trigger automated actions based on visual cues through perception tools, which enables integrations with your existing systems and workflows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Raven Works

Raven-0 implements a dual-track vision processing system that mirrors human perception:

### Ambient Perception

Ambient perception acts as the replica's "eyes," continuously processing and understanding the visual environment at a low level. This provides ambient context that informs the replica's responses without requiring explicit queries.

* **Default Queries**: Raven automatically processes visual information to understand who the user is, what they look like, their emotional state, and other contextual information.
* **Custom Queries**: You can define custom visual queries that Raven will continuously monitor for, allowing for specialized use cases.

### Active Perception

When specific visual information is needed, Raven can perform detailed on-demand analysis:

* **Speculative Execution**: Raven uses speculative execution to pre-process likely visual queries while the user is speaking, minimizing perceived latency.

### Screenshare Vision

Raven processes screen content with higher detail retention, allowing for animations, dynamic content and pages to be captured. This way, you can share your calendar, documents, and other content with your replica, and switching between screens is seamless.

### Perception Tools

Perception tools are a way to trigger automated actions based on visual cues. Whereas Ambient Perception allows the replica to be aware of visual cues in the context of the conversation, the tools allow your system to be aware of them. They are configured in such a way that the replica can trigger them when the visual cue is detected in near real-time.

When a perception tool is triggered, a [Perception Tool Call](/sections/event-schemas/conversation-perception-tool-call) event is broadcasted. This event contains the name of the tool, any arguments passed to it, and the encoded frames (in base64) that triggered the tool call. You may choose to store the frames for later analysis, or to use them to trigger other actions (eg. ID lookup, document processing, etc).

### End-of-call Perception Analysis

At the end of a call, Raven will summarize the visual artifacts that were detected throughout the call. This is a feature that is only available when the persona has `raven-0` specified in the perception layer, and will be broadcasted as a [Perception Analysis](/sections/event-schemas/conversation-perception-analysis) event and separately as a [conversation callback](/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation-callbacks).

# Record and Instantly Share Conversations
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/recording-rooms

You can set up a custom S3 bucket, enable recordings in rooms, and get notified when recordings are ready to be shared.

## Recordings

You, as a developer, are able to bring your own S3 bucket to save conversation recordings, having data never touch our servers. There are two ways to get this set up.

### Option 1 - Automated script - *For advanced users*

Our friends over at Daily have created a [custom script](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-recordings-bucket) that will automate the following process of setting up an S3 bucket under your organization with the right permissions.

You can run `npm install` and setup your AWS credentials, and the script will handle the rest.

### Option 2 - Manual setup

Here is a [step-by-step guide](/sections/conversational-video-interface/s3-recording-setup) to setting up an S3 bucket for Tavus CVI recordings.

## Callbacks

Upon conversation creation, when you specify a `callback_url`, you will be ingesting an `application.recording_ready` webhook after the conversation is over or when you manually stop a recording, which will point to the key that locates your recording file in your S3 bucket.

## Enable Recording

To make a conversation recording enabled, you need to set `enable_recording=true`. Note that this will only *enable* you to record, but not actually record the room automatically. To start and stop recordings, the user can do this manually, or you can use frontend code. Here is an [example application](https://github.com/Tavus-Engineering/tavus-examples/tree/main/examples/start-stop-recording) using JS.

Head over to Daily's [Recording API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/recordings) for more detail.


# Server to Server Architecture
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/server-to-server



# Using Echo Pipeline Modes with a Server-Server Architecture

With both Audio and Text Echo pipeline modes you can use the Daily/WebRTC room to provide a video call interface to your user while controlling the replica. However you can also directly establish the connection with your server and receive the replica video stream directly back to your server for further processing.

### When should you do server to server?

You should do server to server if you need to forward the video stream and cannot directly connect the viewer of the stream to the Daily room.

Examples:

* If you are doing a one to many stream (live streaming) and need to pipe into RTMP
* If you are piping into a third party meeting platform like Zoom or Google Meets and need to create a virtual camera using the video feed

Note that going down the server to server route **will add latency**, as the video stream has to make it back to your server and then you have to transmit it to the end viewer.

### When should you connect your viewer directly to the Daily WebRTC stream?

We recommend this for most use cases to minimize latency. You can directly connect your viewer to the Daily WebRTC stream minimizing any latency. You can choose whether to use the Daily WebRTC room we create for a conversation to receive your viewer's video/audio stream, or create a direct client/server connection with your own server.

# Using Replicas in CVI
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/using-replica-in-cvi



### The replica is the 'talking head'.

The first step to using CVI is selecting a replica. Tavus has stock replicas you can use as well as the ability to create custom replicas via the API or the portal.

## Stock Replicas

You can get started quickly be using one of our stock replicas. We have a few replicas that we recommend for conversational usage:

  </CardGroup>
</Accordion>

## Custom Replica

You can use a custom or 'personal replica'. If you have already created a custom replica for video generation you can reuse that replica for CVI. However, what looks good for video generation does not necessary look good for conversational (CVI). We recommend following the instructions for [Creating a good replica for CVI](/sections/replicas/personal-replicas) for the best results.

## What makes for a good replica for CVI?

### Silent frames

The main difference between using a replica for video generation vs CVI is that videos don’t have long periods of pauses, whereas during a conversation you take turns, therefore the replica sits in silent listening or waiting. This can look odd if you try to use a replica that is meant for video generation because the replica might move unnaturally during these periods of silence.

### Casual/low-production environment

For most use cases CVI is supposed to feel like a 1:1 call. It should feel like you’re jumping on a Zoom call with someone. This means that the setting and environment should feel like a Zoom call, not a studio environment. A webcam at a desk for example will feel more natural than an awkward replica that is standing the entire time. Users don’t expect you to be in a studio every time you’re on a Zoom call and it can actually detract from the experience. This doesn’t mean you can’t shoot in studio, it just means that the studio setting itself should look casual as well.

# Echo Interaction
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-echo

This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

By broadcasting this event, you are able to tell the replica what to exactly say. Anything that is passed in the `text` field will be spoken by the replica.

This is commonly used in combination with the [Interrupt Interaction](/sections/event-schemas/conversation-interrupt).




# Interrupt Interaction
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-interrupt

This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

By broadcasting this event, you are able to externally send interruptions for the replica to stop talking. This is commonly used in combination with [Text Echo Interactions](/sections/event-schemas/conversation-echo).




# Overwrite Conversational Context interaction
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-overwrite-context

This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

By broadcasting this event, you are able to overwrite the `conversational_context` that the replica uses to generate responses. 

If `conversational_context` was not provided during conversation creation, the replica will start using the `context` you provide in this event as `conversational_context`.

Learn more about the `conversational_context`: [Create Conversation](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation)




# Perception Analysis
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-perception-analysis

This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

This is fired after ending a conversation, when the replica has finished summarizing the visual artifacts that were detected throughout the call. This is a feature that is only available when the persona has `raven-0` specified in the [Perception Layer](/sections/conversational-video-interface/raven).




# Perception Tool Call Event
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-perception-tool-call

This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

A `perception_tool_call` event is broadcasted by Tavus when a perception tool is triggered based on visual context. The event will contain the tool name, arguments, and encoded frames that triggered said tool call.

Perception tool calls can be used to trigger automated actions in response to visual cues detected by the Raven perception system.




# Replica Interrupted Event
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-replica-interrupted

This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

An utterance event is broadcasted by Tavus when the replica is interrupted by the user while it is speaking.




# Replica Started/Stopped Speaking Event
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-replica-started-stopped-speaking

This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

A `replica.started_speaking/stopped_speaking event` is broadcasted by Tavus at specific times: 

conversation.replica.started_speaking means the replica has just started speaking.
conversation.replica.stopped_speaking means the replica has just stopped speaking.

These events are intended to act as triggers for actions within your application. For instance, you may want to
start a video or show a slide at times related to when the replica started or stopped speaking.

The inference_id can be used to correlate other events and tie things like conversation.utterance or tool_call
together. 




# Text Respond Interaction
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-respond

This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

By broadcasting this event, you are able to send text that the replica will to respond to. The text you provide in the event will essentially be treated as the user transcript, and will be responded to as if the user had uttered those phrases during conversation.




# Sensitivity Interaction
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-sensitivity

This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

By broadcasting this event, you are able to update the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) sensitivity of the replica in
two dimensions. 
- participant_pause_sensitivity
- participant_interrupt_sensitivity

The supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`.

Learn more about the `sensitivity`: [Get Started with Your Own STT](/sections/conversational-video-interface/custom-stt-onboarding)




# Utterance Event
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-utterance

This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

An `utterance event` is broadcasted by Tavus at specific times: the user’s utterance is sent when the replica begins speaking, and a separate event for the replica’s utterance is also sent as the replica starts to speak. Each event contains the content of the respective utterance as well as an indication of who spoke it.

An `utterance` includes all of the words spoken by the user or replica measured from when the person started speaking to when they finshed speaking. This could include multiple sentences or phrases.

Utterance events can be used to keep track of what the user or the replica has said.

# Creating a Replica Via API
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/guides/replica-training-guide

Learn how to use our API endpoints to create replicas.

***

## Replica Creation with API Overview

Follow this guide to successfully create and retrieve a replica using our API endpoints. Before continuing, ensure that you have recorded training footage by following the instructions in our [Training Guide](/sections/replicas/replica-training/). Verify that:

* Training footage consists of [1 minute of talking](/sections/replicas/replica-training#how-do-i-record-1-minute-of-talking), followed by [1 minute of silence](/sections/replicas/replica-training#how-do-i-record-1-minute-of-silence) in the **same** video
* You have 2 separate videos for your consent footage and training footage
* Alternatively, you have 1 combined video that starts with consent statement

## Step 0: Ensure you have an API Key

You cannot send us API requests without a valid key.
If your organization does not have an API key, read [Getting an API Key](/sections/guides/api-key-guide/) to set this up.

## Step 1: Upload Training Footage to S3

In order for us to access your training footage, you need to upload it onto S3 and provide us with a public download link (e.g. [pre-signed S3 url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html)). Make sure that your url is valid for **at least 24 hours**.

## Step 2: Send Training Footage to Tavus

You are now ready to submit your footage for training! Reference our [Create Replica API Reference](/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/create-replica) to build out your request body. Once ready, include your API Key as a header and fire off your request to our endpoint.

By default, all new replicas will be trained using the `phoenix-3` model. You can optionally create phoenix-2 replicas by setting the `model_name` parameter to `phoenix-2` in the request body.

  	fmt.Println(string(body))

  }
  ```

  ```java Java
  HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.get("https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas/{replica_id}")
    .header("x-api-key", "<api-key>")
    .asString();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you should get a response from us with information about your replica. Refer to `"status"` to check your replica’s training progress.

# Language Support
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/replicas/language-support



Tavus enables the creation of videos in a multitude of languages, expanding the reach of content globally. When you input a script in any of the supported languages, the resulting video features your replica articulating the message in that specific language.

For example, by providing a script in Spanish, as shown in the example below, your replica will deliver the content in Spanish, mirroring natural language nuances and expressions. You can even mix and match languages in the same script.

```json
{
  "replica_id": "r0923com7w",
  "script": "¡Hola a todos, este no es Hassaan!"
}
```

Please note that the voice cloning model attempts to maintain your accent even whilst speaking a different language. This can sometimes result in, for example, an American Accent while speaking Spanish.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/replicas/overview

Overview of Tavus' Replica offerings- Stock Replicas and Personal Replicas, all powered by the Phoenix AI model. Get tips on how to create the perfect replica, and how to get a high quality output.

A Replica is a realistic video model of a human created using the [Phoenix Model](/sections/replicas/phoenix-model). The Phoenix model is a fully-synthetic 3D based model that generates realistic replica videos from just a script, complete with natural face (lip, cheek, nose, chin) movements and expressions synchronized with your script and generated voice. Developed by our team, the model uses a novel approach that bypasses traditional methods and constructs dynamic, three-dimensional facial scenes using neural radiance fields (NeRFs).

Replicas are created using just 2 minutes of training data, and are designed to learn how someone speaks and sounds, how they look, and how they move their face while speaking. Using a Replica you can generate hyper-realistic videos that look and sound just like you- from just text, in up to 30 languages.

It's important to provide a high-quality input video in order to get great outputs from a Replica. Your Replica will attempt to mimic your gestures and movements, as well as your accent, even if you generate a video in a different language.

Here's an example of an output from one of our Stock Replicas:

<video width="100%" height="auto" controls>
  <source src="https://tavus-sample-vids.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/launch/Amy_launch_2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## Stock Replicas

* High-quality, diverse selection
* Available immediately
* Can be used for majority of use-cases

Developers on all plans can access our [stock Replicas](/sections/replicas/stock-replicas), offering a quick start option for content creation.

## Personal Replicas

* High-quality clone of voice and face of person
* Train once, and re-use endlessly without having to record again

[Personal Replicas](/sections/replicas/personal-replicas) allow you to train a new Replica of a human using the Phoenix model, from just 2 minutes of training data. Personal Replicas take between 4-6 hours to train.
You can only train Replicas using training data that has a verbal [consent statement](/sections/troubleshooting/consent-statement). Personal Replicas go through Voice and Face ID checks to ensure consent is present.

Developers on the Hobbyist, Business, and Enterprise plans can create Personal Replicas. If you want to try making your own, you can do so through the Developer Portal or via the API.


# Personal Replicas
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/replicas/personal-replicas

Learn how to create a high-quality personal replica with just a few minutes of training data.

## Getting Started with Your Personal Replica

Personal Replicas allow you to train a new Replica of a human using the Phoenix model, from just 2 minutes of training data. Personal Replicas take approximately 4-5 hours to train, and are available on all plans except for Starter.

### Create a Replica via the UI (Developer Portal)

You can create a Replica via the Developer Portal. Navigate to the [Replicas tab](https://platform.tavus.io/auth/sign-up) in our portal. Here, you'll be able to record in app or upload footage to create a new Replica.

### Create a Replica via the API

Are you interested in using the API? See details about our API [here](/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/create-replica).

* **Record Footage**: Have around 1.5 to 2 minutes of video ready following the below guidelines.
* **API Key**: Make sure you have a valid API key
* **Upload Footage**: Your recording should be hosted on a storage location like S3, should be publicly accessible / URL presigned, and the access should be valid for at least 24 hours to ensure the model has access.
* **API Reference**: Refer to the [replica creation reference](/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/create-replica) to submit your model for training.

## Recording Your Training Footage

Your journey to creating a personal Replica begins with a simple requirement: a two-minute video of you engaging with the camera. There is no predefined script beyond the consent statement, you can discuss anything that showcases your natural speaking style and expertise.

#### Tips for Success

Our platform simplifies the first step. Use your webcam through the developer portal to capture the essence of your persona. Achieving the best possible Replica involves attention to detail. Here's how:

* **Do:** Utilize high-definition recording equipment, ensure proper lighting, and maintain focus on your face and upper body. Aim for a quiet, well-lit setting, and speak naturally. See more in [Replica Training](/sections/replicas/replica-training).
* **Don't:** Wear clothes that blend with the background, bulky accessories, or any headwear that obscures your face. Keep your gaze steady, minimize background distractions, and avoid excessive movement.

**Here's an example of high quality training footage:**

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="https://tavus-sample-vids.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Ari-Input-NEW.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

#### Consent

An integral part of the process involves reading a specific authorization phrase. This step confirms your consent and kicks off the Replica creation process.

> "I, \[FULL NAME], am currently speaking and give consent to Tavus to create an AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and sound like me."

* We currently accept consent statements in **any** of our supported languages. You can see the [supported languages here](/sections/replicas/language-support#languages-we-support).

See [Consent Statement](/sections/troubleshooting/consent-statement) for more information. The consent statement can be customized as part of Business and Enterprise plans.

#### How to Act

* **Gaze:** Keep eye level with the camera, maintain relatively stable eye contact.
* **Gesturing:** Avoid crossing your hands in front of your face and limit gestures.
* **Tone:** Aim for an upbeat tone to keep the content positive and engaging.
* **Mistakes:** Perfection in reading the script isn't required. Continue naturally if you stumble.
* **Lips:** Close your lips during pauses (the script will remind you of this).

#### Recording Format

If you are uploading training footage, it's important that it is in the correct format:

* **Format and Quality:** MP4 format is required, with a resolution up to 4K and a size limit of 750 MB. NOTE: Tavus accepts up to 4k for resolution, however more common webcam resolutions (such as 720p/1080p) are also known to produce excellent replicas.

* **Content Authenticity:** Provide unedited, raw footage for the most genuine Replica creation.

#### Train in Chosen Language

We highly recommend the full training to be done in the language you are most likely to use for the generated videos. This does not prohibit future videos from being created in a different language if desired!

### Training Time & Next Steps

Your replica will be processed in the background upon submission. This process will take around 4-5 hours. You can check the status of your replica training through:

* A callback URL (if specified in API requests)
* The [Get Replica](/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/get-replica) API endpoint
* The Developer Portal

If you're not happy with your personal replica, be sure to contact us.


# Replica Training
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/replicas/replica-training

Learn how to create the best personal replica with a high-quality training video.

## Training Overview

To train your personal replica, we first need you to submit a **training video**.
A high-quality training video helps our AI model properly map your face and voice,
resulting in a more realistic replica overall. Your training video will be **one continuous video**, containing the following, in-order:

<ol>
  <li>1 minute of talking</li>
  <li>1 minute of silence (active listening)</li>
</ol>

You can record your training video in app on the [Developer Portal](https://platform.tavus.io/). Alternatively, you can upload a pre-recorded video on the Developer Portal or through our [API endpoint](https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/create-replica).

Training typically takes around 4-5 hours to complete. You can check the status of your replica training by:

* Specifying a `callback_url` when creating the replica via API
* Using the [Get Replica Status API endpoint](https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/get-replica)
* Checking the [Developer Portal](https://platform.tavus.io)

## How do I record 1 minute of talking?

We do not require a predefined script. You are welcome to discuss anything that showcases your natural speaking style and expertise.

## How do I record 1 minute of silence?

Your training footage should conclude with 1 minute of silence. Our model uses your silent footage to create a natural resting position for your replica's head and improve its listening behavior. During this period:

* Pretend that you are "actively listening" to someone
* Incorporate small (but non-repetitive) head movements throughout the minute
* Ensure that your lips are closed the entire time

## How do I create a high-quality training video?

To ensure your replica is the best possible quality,
follow the guidelines below before recording your training footage.

### Step 1: Set up environment 🌞

Ensure that you are in a quiet, well-lit area without background movement.

✔️ Check that your face is evenly lit without any shadows. A large diffuse light works best for neutral lighting.<br />
✔️ Avoid environments with background noise or reverb (e.g. air conditioning, construction).<br />
✔️ Keep your background clear by removing moving objects and people.<br />

### Step 2: Set up camera 📷

Check your camera's settings and position it in front of your setup.

✔️ Use a camera with at least 2k pixels, e.g. DSLR, newer laptops, Google Pixel.<br />
✔️ Make sure your camera is set to 30 frames per second (24-60 FPS is also fine). <br />
✔️ Position your camera at eye-level from your setup. You should take up **at least** 25% of the frame.<br />
✔️ Make sure your exposure, white balance, and color profile settings are properly adjusted to prevent your video from looking washed out.<br />
✔️ Ensure your lens is clean.<br />

### Step 3: Set up microphone 🎙️

Configure your microphone. We recommend to start with your phone or computer's microphone.

✔️ Do **not** use a high-quality microphone or wireless earbuds (e.g. Apple Airpods). We find that natural audio works best!<br />
✔️ If you use an external USB/XLR mic, ensure that the mic is not blocking your chin or lips.<br />
✔️ Disable software-based audio enhancements, such as compressors, equalizers, and noise suppression.<br />

### Step 4: Set up yourself 🙎

Ensure that your full head is clearly visible in the frame.

✔️  If possible, avoid beards, glasses, high-collar shirts (e.g. turtlenecks) and accessories (e.g. hats).<br />
✔️   Tuck back hair blocking the face.<br />

### Step 5: Record training video ⏺️

Read the [consent script](/sections/troubleshooting/consent-statement), followed by 1 minute of talking and 1 minute of true silence.

✔️ Aim for an engaging tone and a relaxed pace, while maintaining continuous eye contact with the camera.<br />
✔️  Minimize body movement, such as hand gestures, head movement, jolts, etc.<br />
✔️ Close your lips during pauses and at the end of sentences.<br />
✔️ If you stumble, continue speaking. Perfection is not necessary!<br />

You can record your training video in any language you prefer. Read more about Tavus's [language flexibility](/sections/replicas/language-support) here.

### Step 6: Check video file requirements ✅

Before sending file to our API endpoint or uploading it on the developer portal, ensure that it meets technical requirements.

<ol>
  <li>Format is either:</li>

  <ul>
    <li>webm</li>
    <li>mp4 with h264 video codec and aac audio codec</li>
  </ul>

  <li>File size is maximum 750MB. If your file is too large, check out our tips for [reducing file size](/sections/troubleshooting/training-video-size).</li>
  <li>Resolution is minimum 720p.</li>
  <li>Video length is at least 2 minutes, containing the consent script, 1 minute of talking and 1 minute of silence in order.</li>
</ol>

### Step 7: Submit your training video 🙌

After ensuring that your training video fits our quality requirements, submit your video through the [Developer Portal](https://platform.tavus.io/replicas/create) or through our [API endpoint](/api-reference/phoenix-replica-model/create-replica).
If you are using our API, make sure that the URL is a download link (e.g. pre-signed Amazon S3 URL).

## Next Steps after Training

Upon submission, your replica will immediately begin training in the background. After around 4-6 hours, you will be notified through email or API callback that your personal replica is ready for use. If you're not happy with the results, be sure to contact us.

# Conversations

### Overview

If `callback_url` is provided in the [Create Conversation API Request](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation), callbacks will be sent to provide inside into the state of the conversation. Our callbacks range from system-related callbacks like replica joins and room shutdowns, to application-related callbacks like final transcription parsing and recording ready webhooks, with many more webhooks coming soon!

## Conversation Callback Types

Our callbacks are split into two main categories:

* System Callbacks

> These callbacks are to provide insight into system-related events in a conversation. They are:

* **system.replica\_joined**: This is fired when the replica becomes ready for a conversation.

* **system.shutdown**: This is fired when the room shuts down, for any of the following reasons: `max_call_duration reached`, `participant_left_timeout reached`, `participant_absent_timeout reached`, `internal error occurred at step x`.

* Application Callbacks

> These callbacks are to inform developers about logical events that take place. They are:

* **application.transcription\_ready**: This is fired after ending a conversation, where the chat history is saved and returned.
* **application.recording\_ready**: This is fired if you had enabled recording on, set up a [custom S3 bucket](/sections/conversational-video-interface/recording-rooms) for recording and started a recording inside the room at any point. This will point to the key at which your new recording lies, useful for serving recordings through a CDN.
* **application.perception\_analysis**: This is fired after ending a conversation, when the replica has finished summarizing the visual artifacts that were detected throughout the call. This is a feature that is only available when the persona has `raven-0` specified in the [Perception Layer](/sections/conversational-video-interface/raven).

## Conversation Callback Structure

All Conversation callbacks will share a similar structure with differences occuring in the `properties` object.

Here is the basic structure for all callbacks:

```
{
  "properties": {
    "replica_id": "<replica_id>"
  },
  "conversation_id": "<conversation_id>",
  "webhook_url": "<webhook_url>",
  "event_type": "<event_type>",
  "message_type": "<system/application>",
  "timestamp": "<timestamp>"
}
```

# Consent Statement
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/troubleshooting/consent-statement



## Introduction

For the creation of any digital replicas using the Phoenix model, Tavus requires a clear, verbal consent statement to be included within the training video. This measure is crucial for ethical considerations and compliance with data protection regulations. Instances where this consent statement is missing can lead to processing delays or the inability to create your AI clone.

## Mandatory Consent Statement

Every training video submitted for Phoenix model training must include the following consent statement, spoken by the individual being replicated:

> "I, \[FULL NAME], am currently speaking and give consent to Tavus to create an AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and sound like me."

### Key Points:

* **Personalization**: Replace "\[FULL NAME]" with your actual full name.
* **Clarity**: The statement must be clearly audible and understandable.
* **Placement**: This consent should be at the beginning of your training video to ensure correct processing.
* **Language**: We currently accept consent statements in **any** of our supported languages. You can see the [supported languages here](/sections/replicas/language-support#languages-we-support).

## Troubleshooting Missing Consent

If you have submitted a training video without the requisite consent statement, it will not be processed, and your request to create a digital replica will be delayed. To resolve this issue:

1. **Re-Record Your Video**: Include the consent statement at the beginning of your new training video.
2. **Submit a New Request**: Upload the revised video and submit a new model training request through the Tavus Developer Portal or via API, as applicable.

## Tips for Successful Consent Recording

* **Environment**: Record in a quiet setting to ensure the consent statement is clearly heard.
* **Articulation**: Speak slowly and clearly, articulating each word to prevent any misunderstandings.
* **Verification**: Review your video before submission to verify that the consent statement is correctly included and easily audible.

## Conclusion

Including a consent statement in your training video is a critical step in the Phoenix model training process with Tavus. It not only ensures compliance with ethical standards and legal requirements but also facilitates a smoother and faster processing of your digital replica creation request. Ensure you follow the guidelines provided to avoid any unnecessary delays in your project.


# Script Length
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/troubleshooting/generated-content-length



## Overview

While Tavus provides the flexibility to generate videos of various lengths, it's important to understand how the duration of a video can impact its overall quality and viewer perception. Videos exceeding approximately 5 minutes may encounter challenges related to gesture repetition and diminished naturalness in the replica's presentation.

## Understanding Video Length Considerations

### Quality Variation Beyond 5 Minutes

Videos longer than 5 minutes are more likely to exhibit:

* **Repeated Gestures**: Increased instances where the replica might repeat motions, making the video feel less dynamic.
* **Decreased Naturalness**: A tendency for the replica's movements to appear less natural or fluid over time due to the limitations in variability of generated gestures.

## Troubleshooting and Optimization Strategies

### Splitting Longer Content

For content that naturally extends beyond the 5-minute mark, consider dividing it into shorter segments. This approach can:

* **Enhance Engagement**: Shorter videos are often more engaging, keeping viewers' attention focused.
* **Maintain Quality**: Reduces the likelihood of encountering issues with repeated gestures or unnatural movements.

### Script Refinement

Refining your script can significantly impact the video's effectiveness and length:

* **Conciseness**: Ensure your script is concise, delivering your message without unnecessary filler.
* **Pacing**: Adjust the pacing of your script to fit within the optimal video length, focusing on key points.

### Using Multiple Replicas

Incorporating different replicas into longer content pieces can introduce variety and maintain viewer interest:

* **Variety**: Switch between replicas to present different sections of your content.
* **Personalization**: Use specific replicas for targeted segments, enhancing relevance and engagement.

### Review and Iteration

After generating your video, review it thoroughly:

* **Identify Repetitions**: Look for and note any instances of repeated gestures or unnatural movements.
* **Iteration**: Use insights from your review to refine the script or consider breaking the content into smaller pieces if necessary.

## Conclusion

While Tavus empowers users to generate videos of any length, being mindful of the potential quality variations in longer videos is crucial. By employing strategies like content splitting, script refinement, and using multiple replicas, you can create high-quality, engaging videos that effectively convey your message. Always review your generated content and be prepared to iterate for the best results.


# Training Video Size
Source: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/troubleshooting/training-video-size



## Overview

When training the Phoenix model with Tavus, the size of your training video plays a crucial role in the processing time and success rate of your model training. To facilitate a smooth and efficient training process, adhering to the recommended video size guidelines is essential.

## Recommended Video Size

The Tavus platform accepts training videos up to 750 MB in size. This limitation is based on our observations of optimal balance between video quality and processing efficiency.

## File Size Considerations

* **Processing Efficiency**: Smaller file sizes typically result in faster upload times and more efficient processing, reducing the overall time required for model training.
* **Success Rate**: Although Tavus will attempt to process larger files up to the 750 MB limit, we cannot guarantee successful processing for all large files. Staying within the recommended size increases the likelihood of a smooth training experience.
* **Quality Preservation**: It's important to balance file size with video quality. Compressing your video to reduce its size should not significantly compromise its resolution, frame rate, or audio quality, as these factors are critical for training a high-quality Phoenix model.

## Tips for Reducing Video File Size

1. **Compression**: Use video compression tools to reduce file size without substantially affecting quality.

<Note>
  Currently, the **H.264 codec is required** by Tavus to ensure efficient compression.
</Note>

2. **Resolution Adjustment**: Consider reducing the video resolution if it's higher than necessary. For most training purposes, a resolution of 1080p (1920x1080) is sufficient.
3. **Trimming**: Remove any unnecessary footage from the beginning and end of your training video to reduce its duration and size.
4. **Frame Rate**: Lower the frame rate slightly if it's higher than 30 frames per second. Reducing the frame rate can decrease the file size without significantly impacting the video's appearance.

## Conclusion

Adhering to the recommended training video size not only ensures efficient processing and higher success rates but also contributes to a smoother model training experience. By optimizing your video file size while maintaining quality, you can achieve the best outcomes from your Phoenix model training with Tavus.
