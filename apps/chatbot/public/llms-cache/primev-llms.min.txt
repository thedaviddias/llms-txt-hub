- [Add Auto Deposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/autodeposit.md): AutoDeposit is called by the bidder node to add a recurring deposit in the bidder registry. The bidder
can specify the amount of ETH to be deposited in each window. The bidder can also specify the start window
number for the deposit. If the start window number is not specified, the current block number is used to
calculate the window number. If the block number is specified, the window number is calculated based on
the block number. One it is enabled, the node will automatically deposit the specified amount in each window
as well as withdraw the deposit from the previous window.
- [Get Auto Deposit Status](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/autodepositstatus.md): AutoDepositStatus is called by the bidder node to get the status of the auto deposit.
- [Cancel Auto Deposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/cancelautodeposit.md): CancelAutoDeposit is called by the bidder node to cancel the auto deposit. The bidder can specify if it
wants to withdraw the deposit from the current deposited windows. If the withdraw flag is set to true, the API will
wait till we can withdraw the deposit from the latest deposited window.
- [Add Deposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/deposit.md): Deposit is called by the bidder node to add deposit in the bidder registry. The bidder can deposit
funds in a particular window by specifying the window number. If the window number is not specified,
the current block number is used to calculate the window number. If the block number is specified,
the window number is calculated based on the block number. If AutoDeposit is enabled, the deposit
API returns error.
- [Retrieve Deposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/getdeposit.md): GetDeposit is called by the bidder to get its deposit in the bidder registry.
- [Send Bid](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/sendbid.md): Send a bid to the bidder mev-commit node. The bid is a message from the bidder to the provider
with the transaction hashes and the amount of ETH that the bidder is willing to pay to the provider
for including the transaction in the block. The bid also includes the block number that the bidder
wants to include the transaction in, the start and end timestamps for the bid decay. The bidder can
optionally include the raw transaction payloads (hex encoded RLP) instead of transaction hashes.
- [Withdraw Deposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/withdraw.md): Withdraw is called by the bidder to withdraw deposit from the bidder registry.
- [Withdraw Deposit From Windows](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/bidder/withdrawfromwindows.md): WithdrawFromWindows is called by the bidder node to withdraw funds from multiple windows.
- [Cancel Transaction](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/debug/canceltx.md): CancelTransaction is called by the provider to cancel a transaction sent from this wallet.
- [Pending Transactions](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/debug/pendingtxs.md): GetPendingTransactions is called by the provider to get the pending transactions for the wallet.
- [Topology](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/debug/topology.md): GetTopology is called by the user to get the topology of the node. The topology
includes connectivity information about the node.

- [Retrieve Stake](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/provider/getstake.md): GetStake is called by the provider to get its stake in the provider registry.
- [Receive Bids](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/provider/receivebids.md): ReceiveBids is called by the provider to receive bids from the mev-commit node.
The mev-commit node will stream bids to the provider as the response. The bid can optionally
have the raw transaction payload in it. The order of the transaction hashes will be the same
as the raw transaction payloads if included.
- [Register Stake](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/provider/registerstake.md): Stake is called by the provider to register or add to its stake in the provider registry.
- [Send Processed Bids](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/provider/sendprocessedbids.md): SendProcessedBids is called by the provider to send processed bids to the mev-commit node.
The provider will stream processed bids to the mev-commit node.
- [Unstake Funds](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.0.0/api-reference/provider/unstake.md): Unstake is called by the provider to request a unstake from the provider registry.
