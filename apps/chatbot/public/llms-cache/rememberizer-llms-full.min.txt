# Why Rememberizer?
Generative AI apps work better when they have access to background information. They need to know what you know. A great way to achieve that is to give them access to relevant content from the documents, data and discussions you create and use. That is what Rememberizer does.
==> personal/rememberizer-slack-integration.md <==

description: >-
This guide will walk you through the process of integrating your Slack
workspace into Rememberizer as a knowledge source.
---
# Rememberizer Slack integration
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Navigate to **Personal > Your Knowledge** tab, or visit [https://rememberizer.ai/personal/knowledge](https://rememberizer.ai/personal/knowledge). You should see all available knowledge sources there, including Slack.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack_personal_knowledge.png" alt="Your Knowledge, ready to connect to Slack"><figcaption><p>Your Knowledge, ready to connect to Slack</p></figcaption></figure>
3. Click the **"Connect"** button of the Slack knowledge source. You will be redirected to a new page asking for your permission to allow Rememberizer to access your Slack workspace.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack_oauth.png" alt="Slack OAuth screen"><figcaption><p>Slack OAuth screen</p></figcaption></figure>
> **Note:** If you see a warning that this application is not authorized by Slack, it is because Rememberizer is intended to search for Slack content outside of Slack, which is against the [Slack App Directory Guidelines](https://api.slack.com/directory/guidelines).
4. Click **"Allow"** to install the Rememberizer Slack app to your workspace. Once you've granted the necessary permissions, you'll be redirected back to our platform, at which you should see your Slack workspace connected and a side panel pops up.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack_auth_redirect.png" alt="A COMPANY has been added as a knowledge source"><figcaption><p>A-COMPANY has been added as a knowledge source</p></figcaption></figure>
5. Now that you're connected, you need to specify which channels our product should source messages from. Choose your desired files or folders from the side panel. If the side panel does not appear, click on the **"Select"** button to open the side panel.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/slack_choose_knowledge.png" alt="Select channels to be embedded as knowledge"><figcaption><p>Select channels to be embedded as knowledge</p></figcaption></figure>
6. After selecting your channels, our system will begin embedding the messages and files. This process may take a few minutes depending on the amount of data.
### What's next?
Use the [Memento](mementos-filter-access.md) feature to filter access to the sourced data. Combine this with your knowledge from other applications such as Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, etc. to form a comprehensive memento.
You can also [Search Your Knowledge](https://rememberizer.ai/personal/search) through our web UI, or better, use this knowledge in an LLM through our GPT app or our public API.
And that's it! If you encounter any issues during the process, feel free to contact our support team.

# Rememberizer Memory integration
### Introduction
Rememberizer Memory allows third party apps to store and access data in a user's Rememberizer account, providing a simple way for valuable information to be saved and utilize across multiple user' applications.
### Benefits
#### For User
Shared Memory creates a single place where key results and information from all the user's apps are available in one location. Some benefits for user include:
* Easy Access: Important data is centralized, allowing both the user and their apps to easily access results from multiple apps in one place.
* Sync Between Apps: Information can be shared and synced between a user's different apps seamlessly without extra effort from the user.
* Persistent Storage: Data remains accessible even if individual apps are uninstalled, unlike app-specific local storage.
#### For App Developers
The Shared Memory provides app developers a simple way to access data from a user's other connected apps:
* No Backend Needed: Apps do not need to develop their own custom backend systems to store and share data.
* Leverage Other Apps: Apps can build on and utilize public data generated by a user's other installed apps, enriching their own functionality.
* Cross-App Integration: Seamless integration and data sharing capabilities are enabled between an app developer's different apps.
By default all apps have read-only access to Shared Memory, while each app can write only to its own memory space. The user has controls to customize access permissions as needed. This balances data sharing with user privacy and control.
### Config Your Memory
#### Global Settings
The Global Settings allow user to configure the default permissions for all apps using Shared Memory. This includes:
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/memory_global_config.png" alt="Config Memory in Knowledge Page"><figcaption><p>Config Memory in Knowledge Page</p></figcaption></figure>
#### Default Memory and Data Access Permissions for Apps
* **Read Own/Write Own:** Apps are exclusively permitted to access and modify their own memory data.
* **Read All/Write Own:** Apps can read memory data across all apps but are restricted to modifying only their own memory data.
* **Disable Memory:** By default, apps cannot access or store memory data.
* **Apply to All Option**: User can apply all app-specific permission settings back to the defaults chosen in Global Settings.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/memory_settings_panel.png" alt="memory settings panel" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
User can clear all Memory documents with _**Forget your memory**_ option:
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/forget_memory_popup.png" alt="Confirmation Modal when Forget Memory"><figcaption><p>Confirmation Modal when Forget Memory</p></figcaption></figure>
#### App Settings
For each connected app, user can customize the Shared Memory permissions. Click on the **"Find an App"**, then click **"Your connected apps"** or go to the link [https://rememberizer.ai/personal/apps/connected](https://rememberizer.ai/personal/apps/connected) to see the list of your connected apps. Then, click **"Change"** on the Memory of the app you want to custom:
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/app_config_memory.png" alt="Config Memory for each App in Connected Apps Page"><figcaption><p>Config Memory for each App in Connected Apps Page</p></figcaption></figure>
#### Memory Access Permissions for Apps
* **Read Own/Write Own**: Permissions allow the app to only access and modify its own memory data, preventing it from interacting with other apps' memory.
* **Read All/Write Own**: The app can view memory data from all apps but is restricted to modifying only its own memory data.
* **Disable Memory**: The app is prohibited from accessing or modifying memory data.
This allows user fine-grained control over how each app can utilize Shared Memory based on the user's trust in that specific app. Permissions for individual apps can be more restrictive than the global defaults.
Together, the Global and App Settings give user powerful yet easy-to-use controls over how their data is shared through Shared Memory.
### Integrate with Memory Feature
#### API Endpoint
Rememberizer expose an API end point [/**api/v1/documents/memorize/**](https://docs.rememberizer.ai/\~/changes/8nxu1gB5bGpm7B5IZlQ8/developer/api-documentations/memorize-content-to-rememberizer) to let GPT App call to memorize the content.
Note: This api is available for Memory with [3rd-party apps with OAuth2 authentication](../developer/authorizing-rememberizer-apps.md) only (not [API-key](../developer/registering-and-using-api-keys.md) yet).
#### Memorize your knowledge
After authorizing with Rememberizer, the third party app can memorize it valuable knowledge.
Here, we will demonstrate a process using Remembeizer GPT App.
*   After using Rememberizer GPT App, user want to memorize the third point "Zero-Cost Abstractions".
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/interact_rememberizer_gpt.png" alt="Interacting with Rememberizer GPT Apps" width="375"><figcaption><p>Interacting with Rememberizer GPT Apps</p></figcaption></figure>
* To use the Rememberizer App's Memory feature, user must first authorize the app to access your project. Use the **memorize** command to tell the app what knowledge it needs to store.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/rememberizer_auth_sign_in.png" alt="Sign In to authorize Rememberizer" width="563"><figcaption><p>Sign In to authorize Rememberizer</p></figcaption></figure>
* User can Config the Memory Option here, with the default value is based on the Global Config
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/authorize_connection_screen.png" alt="Authorizing Screen" width="563"><figcaption><p>Authorizing Screen</p></figcaption></figure>
The Rememberizer now successfully memorizes knowledge.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/successful_memorize_knowledge.png" alt="successful memorize knowledge" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* In Rememberizer, user can see the recent content at **Embed Knowledge Details** page.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/embedded_knowledge_detail.png" alt="embedded knowledge detail" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
With the **Talk to Slack** app, user can seamlessly apply and continue their progress using the data they have committed to memory. For example, memorized information they can easily query and retrieve
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/recall_memory_talk_to_slack.png" alt="Recall Memory Data in another app"><figcaption><p>Recall Memory Data in another app</p></figcaption></figure>
### Using Memory Data via Memento
* Another way to utilize the memory data is by creating **Memento** and refine the Memory into it. Visit [Memento Feature](mementos-filter-access.md#how-to-create-a-mementos) section for further information about creation instruction.
* Rememberizer saves content into files and user can choose any app to refine its content into **Memento**.
> Note: In older version, Rememberizer saves content into files and combine into folder for each date.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/memory_memento_feature.png" alt="memory memento feature" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
With the [Memento Feature](https://docs.rememberizer.ai/personal/mementos-filter-access#what-is-a-memento-and-why-do-they-exist), user can utilize the Memory data even when the Memory App Config is Off.
### Search Memory document in Rememberizer
You can also [Search Your Knowledge](https://rememberizer.ai/personal/search) through our web UI, or better, use this knowledge in an LLM through our GPT app or our public API.

# Rememberizer App
### Introduction.
Rememberizer App is a MacOS desktop application that converts your local files into vector embeddings and uploads them to your Rememberizer's knowledge as a data source. The application enables other LLMs to query your embeddings through Rememberizer's APIs to make answers based on your local files content.
### Benefits.
* **Data Utilization:** The application helps you to utilize your local files in a meaningful and productive way. It extracts valuable data from your files and makes it available for machine learning processes.
* **Ease of Use:** The application has a user-friendly interface and it’s easy to install and use. It does all the heavy lifting of converting files and uploading the data, so you don't have to.
* **Integration:** The Rememberizer App seamlessly integrates with other LLMs. This allows them to query your embeddings through Rememberizer's APIs to generate answers based on the content of your local files.
### Installation.

# Common knowledge
## What is common knowledge
In Rememberizer, registered users **(publishers)** can select their uploaded documents through mementos and share them publicly as common knowledge. Other users **(subscribers)** can access this public knowledge and add it to their own resources.
By contributing their data, other users can collectively enhance the available information on the common knowledge page. This collaborative approach allows all users to access a richer data source, thereby improving the learning capabilities of their AI applications.
## Add public common knowledge
In order to subscribe a common knowledge to your resource, follow the instructions below
* On navigation bar, choose **Personal > Common Knowledge**. Then, you will see the public common knowledge page.

# Mementos Filter Access
### What is a Memento and Why do they Exist?
A major purpose of Rememberizer is to share highly relevant extracts of your data with 3rd party applications in a controlled fashion. This is achieved through the application of a single **Memento** to each application that is integrated with Rememberizer that you also choose to authorize to access your data in Rememberizer.
The current implementation of Memento allows the user to select specific files, documents or groups of content such as a folder or channel that can be used by that application. Later implementations will add additional ways to filter 3rd party access such as time frames like "created in the last 30 days".\
\
Two default values are "None" and "All". All shares every file that the user has allowed Rememberizer to access. None shares nothing with the app in question. Selecting None allows a user to select an app and integrate it with Rememberizer without having to decide then and there what content to make available. Selecting a Memento with None or editing an existing applied Memento to share None is a way to turn off an apps access to user data without having to remove the integration. This is like an off switch for your data. Custom Mementos can be purpose made and have names that reflect that, such as "Homework" or "Marketing".
### How to create a Mementos?
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Mementos
1. Navigate to **Personal > Memento: Limit Access** in tab, or visit [https://rememberizer.ai/personal/memento](https://rememberizer.ai/personal/memento). You should see all Mementos the left of the screen

* Personal information, such as your name, email address, and other identifiers by which you may be contacted online or offline.
* Technical data, such as information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Service, and usage details.
* API keys and credentials for accessing third-party vendor generative AI models provisioned by you.
* Document content ("Knowledge") which consists of entire documents (such as Google Docs), data, discussion (such as the content of a Slack channel). These come from data sources that you select and choose to share with Rememberizer.&#x20;
We collect this information:
* Directly from you when you provide it to us by authorizing access to a data source.
* Directly from when an app you have integrated with Rememberizer chooses to store text in Rememberizer memory for later use by that app or others.
* Automatically as you navigate through the Service. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.
* Automatically when you change the source data so that the latest version can be reflected in our Knowledge.
* We affirm that any User Data retrieved from Google Workspace APIs is not used to train any AI/ML models. This data is accessible only to the individual user who has provided explicit consent, and it is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving our services to you.
### How We Use Your Information
We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:
* To provide you with the Service and its contents, and any other information, products or services that you request from us.
* To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.
* To provide you with notices about your account.
* To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.
* To notify you about changes to our Service or any products or services we offer or provide through it.
* To improve our Service, products, or services.
* To allow you to participate in interactive features on our Service.
* Text components of Knowledge documents are stored in chunks and indexed in vector data stores so that parts that are estimated to have semantic relevance can be returned to third party applications that you authorize to have that access.&#x20;
### Third Party Sharing
A major purpose of Rememberizer is to share highly relevant extracts of your data with 3rd party applications in a controlled fashion. This is achieved through the application of a single **Memento** to each application that is integrated with Rememberizer that you also choose to authorize to access your data in Rememberizer.
The current implementation of Memento allows the user to select specific files, documents or groups of content such as a folder or channel that can be used by that application. Later implementations will add additional ways to filter 3rd party access such as time frames like "created in the last 30 days".\
\
Two default values are "None" and "All". All shares every file that the user has allowed Rememberizer to access. None shares nothing with the app in question. Selecting None allows a user to select an app and integrate it with Rememberizer without having to decide then and there what content to make available. Selecting a Memento with None or editing an existing applied Memento to share None is a way to turn off an apps access to user data without having to remove the integration. This is like an off switch for your data. Custom Mementos can be purpose made and have names that reflect that, such as "Homework" or "Marketing".&#x20;
### Disclosure of Your Information
We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:
* To third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work.
* To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
* With your consent.

# What are Vector Embeddings and Vector Databases?
Rememberizer uses vector embeddings in vector databases to enable searches for semantic similarity within user knowledge sources. This is a fundamentally more advanced and nuanced form of information retrieval than simply looking for keywords in content through a search engine or database.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/multidimensional_space.png" alt="A multidimensional Space"><figcaption><p>A multidimensional Space</p></figcaption></figure>
In their most advanced form (as used by Rememberizer) vector embeddings are created by language models with architectures similar to the AI LLMs (Large Language Models) that underpin OpenAI's gpt models and ChatGPT service as well as models/services from Google (Gemini) , Anthropic (Claude), Facebook (LLama 2) and others. For this reason it is natural to use vector embeddings to discover relevant knowledge to include in the context of AI model prompts. The technologies are complementary and somewhat equivalent. For this reason most providers of LLMs as a service will also produce vector embeddings as a service (for example:  [a blog from Together AI](https://www.together.ai/blog/embeddings-endpoint-release) or [another blog from OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings)).
What does a vector embedding look like? Consider a co-ordinate (x,y) in two dimensions. If it represents a line from the orgin to this point, we can think of it as a line with a direction, in other words a _vector in two dimensions._ In our context, a vector embedding will be a list of something like 768 numbers representing a vector in a 768-dimensional space. Ultimately this list of numbers can represent weights between zero and one in a Transformer model that define the meaning in a phrase such as "A bolt of lightening out of the blue." This is fundamentally the same underlying representation of meaning used in GPT-4 for example. As a result, we can expect a good vector embedding to enable the same brilliant apparent understanding that we see in modern AI language models.
\
It is worth noting that vector embeddings can be used to represent more than just text, but also other types of data such as images or sound. And with a properly trained model one can compare across media, so that a vector embedding on a block of text can be compared to an image, or _visa versa_. Today Rememberizer enables searches within just the text component of user documents and knowledge. But text-to-image and image-to-text search are on the roadmap.\
\
Google uses vector embeddings to power their text search (text-to-text) and also their image search (text-to-image) ([reference](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/meet-ais-multitool-vector-embeddings)) . Facebook has contemplated using embeddings for their social network search ([reference](https://research.facebook.com/publications/embedding-based-retrieval-in-facebook-search/)). Snapchat uses vector embeddings to understand context in order to serve the right ad to the right use at the right time ([reference](https://eng.snap.com/machine-learning-snap-ad-ranking)).
To deeply understand how vector embedding and vector databases work start with the [overview](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings) from Hugging Face. Pinecone (a vector embedding database as a service) has a good [overview](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/) as well.
Another great source for understanding the search and knowledge in vectors is the Meta/Facebook paper and code for the FAISS library. "FAISS: A Library for Efficient Similarity Search and Clustering of Dense Vectors" by Johnson, Douze, and Jégou (2017): FAISS provides a comprehensive overview of a library designed for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It discusses methods for optimizing the indexing and search processes in large-scale vector databases, including those based on Product Quantization. The best place to learn more about this is the documentation along with the [code on Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).
\
Be sure to consider the June 2017 paper that started the genAI (generative artificial intelligence) revolution, "Attention Is All You Need." ([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) which introduces the Transformer architecture behind GPT models and all the LLMs that follow from OpenAI, Google, Meta (Facebook), Nvidia, Microsoft, IBM, Anthropic, Mistral, Salesforce, xAI (Elon Musk), Stability AI, Cohere, and many other open sources.\
Consider also, "Approximate Nearest Neighbors: Towards Removing the Curse of Dimensionality" ([reference 1998](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/276698.276876), [reference 2010](https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v008a014/v008a014.pdf)). These papers discuss the theory behind approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces, a core concept in vector databases for efficiently retrieving similar items.
{% hint style="info" %}
One exciting thing about these Transformer-based models is that the more data they used, the bigger (more parameters) they got, the better their understanding and capabilities. OpenAI first noticed this when they trained their GPT-2 model. Realizing this potential, they immediately stopped being an open-source oriented non-profit and became a closed source for-profit company focused on producing GPT-3, GPT-4 and its famous front end, ChatGPT. Interestingly, Google owns the patent on this technology -- it was their researchers behind Transformers and Attention Is All You Need ([reference](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10452978B2/en)).\
\
ChatGPT begs to differ a bit about my characterization, writing that "The narrative around OpenAI's transition from an open-source-oriented non-profit to a closed-source for-profit entity simplifies a complex evolution. OpenAI's shift included a focus on safety and responsible AI development alongside commercialization aspects. It's also worth noting that while OpenAI has prioritized developing proprietary technology like GPT-3 and beyond, it continues to engage with the research community through publications and collaborations."
{% endhint %}
BERT language models are based on Transformers and are often used in advanced vector embedding engines. This was introduced in the 2018 paper "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" ([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)). BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) marked a significant shift towards pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks. Its innovative use of bidirectional training and transformer architecture set new standards for model performance across numerous benchmarks.\
\
Earlier innovative methods for creating vector embeddings were introduced by GloVe (2014, Stanford), Word2Vec (2013, Google). "GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation" ([reference](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf)): The GloVe (Global Vectors) paper proposed a new global log-bilinear regression model for the unsupervised learning of word representations, combining the benefits of the two main approaches to embedding: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" ([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)): This paper introduced Word2Vec, a groundbreaking approach to generating word embeddings. Word2Vec models, including the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram models, are pivotal in the evolution of word embeddings.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Rememberizer App and connect
with OpenAI GPT, allowing the GPT to have access to Rememberizer API
funtionality.

# Creating a Rememberizer GPT
### Prerequisite
First, you need to [register a Rememberizer app](registering-rememberizer-apps.md) and configure it with the appropriate settings.
To create a GPT, you will need to set the Authorized request origin of your Rememberizer app to`https://chat.openai.com`.
> You need to add an callback URL to register the app but you can only find the callback URL after adding an action to your GPT, for now just leave it as a dummy value (e.g https://chat.openai.com). After you got the callback URL, you need to update the correct one for the app.\
> \
> <mark style="color:red;">**Note:**</mark> <mark style="color:red;">GPTs update their callback URL after you change their configuration. Make sure to copy the latest callback URL.</mark>
After creating an app, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. We will be using them when creating a GPT. The instruction about how to get these information can be visited at [Authorizing Rememberizer apps](https://docs.rememberizer.ai/developer/authorizing-rememberizer-apps).
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/registered_app_credentials.png" alt="registered app credentials"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
### Create a GPT
You can start by [creating a GPT in the ChatGPT UI](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor).
{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: Creating custom GPT app is only available for pricing plan account.
{% endhint %}
#### GPT configurations
You can fill in the information as you wish. Here is an example that you can try out:
<table><thead><tr><th width="156">Field</th><th>Example value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>RememberizerGPT</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>Talk directly to all your pdfs, docs, sheets, slides on Google Drive and Slack channels.</td></tr><tr><td>Instructions</td><td>Rememberizer is designed to interact seamlessly with the Rememberizer tool, enabling users to efficiently query their data from multiple sources such as Google Drive and Slack. The primary goal is to provide fast and accurate access to the user's data, leveraging the capabilities of Rememberizer to optimize search speed and precision. The GPT should guide users in formulating their queries and interpreting the results, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. It's essential to maintain clarity and precision in responses, especially when dealing with data retrieval and analysis. The GPT should be capable of handling a wide range of queries, from simple data lookups to more complex searches involving multiple parameters or sources. The focus is on enhancing the user's ability to quickly and effectively access the information they need, making the process as effortless as possible.</td></tr></tbody></table>
#### Create Rememberizer action

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/create-common-knowledge-2.png" alt="create common knowledge 2" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
After you have filled the form, click on "Share knowledge" in the bottom to create your common knowledge. After that, turn on the **"Enable sharing"** in your knowledge and click **"Confirm"** in the pop up modal.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/common_knowledge_sharing.png" alt="common knowledge sharing"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
You now are ready to obtain its API Key and access its documents via API calls.
### Getting the API Key of a common knowledge you created
For your common knowledge, click on the three dots on its top right, then choose "API Key". If there is none yet, one will be created for you. If the API Key exists it will be returned.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/knowledge_open_API_key.png" alt="knowledge open API key"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
In the **"Manage your API Key"** panel, you can click on the **"eye"** button to show/hide, the **"copy"** button to copy the key to clipboard, and **"Regenerate API Key"** to invalidate the old key and create a new one (apps that are accessing your documents through api calls won't be able to access until you have updated the new key into them).
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/copy-api-key.png" alt="copy api key"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
After obtaining the API Key, you can proceed to using it in your API calls to Rememberizer to query your indexed documents and contents.
### Using the API Key
To access Rememberizer endpoints, you will use the API Key in the `X-API-Key` header of your API requests. Please check out the [API Documentation](api-documentations/) to see the endpoints that Rememberizer provides.
You can also use the API Key in a custom GPT app. Start by [creating a GPT in the ChatGPT UI](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor). Make sure to choose the Authentication Type as "API Key", Auth Type as "Custom" and the header as "X-Api-Key", then paste the key you copied previously into the API Key textbox.

# LangChain integration
{% embed url="https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/rememberizer/" %}
This notebook shows how to retrieve documents from `Rememberizer` the Document format that is used downstream.
## Preparation
You will need an API key: You can get one after creating a common knowledge. Detail instruction about how to create common knowledge can be visited at [Registering and using API Keys](https://docs.rememberizer.ai/developer/registering-and-using-api-keys).
Once you have an API key, you must set it as an environment variable `REMEMBERIZER_API_KEY` or pass it as `rememberizer_api_key` when initializing `RememberizerRetriever`.
`RememberizerRetriever` has these arguments:
\- Optional `top_k_results`: default=10. Use it to limit number of returned documents.
\- Optional `rememberizer_api_key`: required if you don’t set the environment variable `REMEMBERIZER_API_KEY`.
`get_relevant_documents()` has one argument, `query`: free text which used to find documents in the common knowledge of `Rememberizer.ai`

-> **Question**: What is RAG?
**Answer**: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is an AI framework that retrieves facts from an external knowledge base to enhance the responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing up-to-date and accurate information. This framework helps users understand the generative process of LLMs and ensures that the model has access to reliable information sources.
-> **Question**: How does Large Language Models works?
**Answer**: Large Language Models (LLMs) work by analyzing massive data sets of language to comprehend and generate human language text. They are built on machine learning, specifically deep learning, which involves training a program to recognize features of data without human intervention. LLMs use neural networks, specifically transformer models, to understand context in human language, making them better at interpreting language even in vague or new contexts. Developers can quickly start building their own LLMs by accessing multiple data sets and using services like Cloudflare's Vectorize and Cloudflare Workers AI platform.

</div>
***
### Introduction
In this guide, we provide step-by-step instructions and full source code to help you create your own application similar to our Talk-to-Slack GPT integration with Rememberizer.ai. Unlike the Slack integration, a web app offers more features and control, such as web scraping, local database access, graphics and animation, and collecting payments. Plus, it can be used by anyone without the need for a premium genAI account.
### Overview
Our example application, Talk to Slack, is hosted on Heroku and integrates OpenAI's LLM with Rememberizer.ai to enhance your Slack experience. The web app is built using Flask and provides features like OAuth2 integration, Slack data access, and an intuitive user interface.
### Features
* **Flask-based Architecture**: Backend operations, frontend communications, and API interactions are handled by Flask.
* **OAuth2 Integration**: Secure authorization and data access with Rememberizer's OAuth2 flow.
* **Slack Data Access**: Fetches user's connected Slack data securely using Rememberizer's APIs.
* **OpenAI LLM Integration**: Processes queries with OpenAI's LLM service for insightful responses.
* **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy navigation and interaction with a modern UI design.
* **Best Practices**: Adheres to security and user experience standards for seamless integration.
### Setup and Deployment
#### Prerequisites
* Python
* Flask
{% hint style="info" %}
Note that it was not very hard to have an LLM rewrite this entire application in another language, in our case Golang. So do keep in mind that you are not limited to Python.
{% endhint %}
#### Environment Configuration
Set these environment variables:
* `APP_SECRET_KEY`: Unique secret key for Flask.
* `REMEMBERIZER_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID for your Rememberizer app.
* `REMEMBERIZER_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret for your Rememberizer app.
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
#### Running the Application
1. **Start Flask App**: Run `flask run` in the terminal and access the app at `http://localhost:5000`.
2. **Copy the callback URL to your Rememberizer app config**: `https://<YOURHOST>/auth/rememberizer/callback` example:`http://localhost:5000/auth/rememberizer/callback`.
#### Deploying to the Cloud
Deployment to platforms like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure is recommended.
**Heroku Deployment**
1. **Create a Heroku Account**: Install the Heroku CLI.
2. **Prepare Your Application**: Ensure a `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`, and `requirements.txt` are present.
3. **Deploy**: Use the Heroku CLI or GitHub integration for deployment.
**Detailed Steps**
* **Connect Heroku to GitHub**: Enable automatic deploys from the GitHub repository for seamless updates.
* **Deploy Manually**: Optionally, use manual deployment for more control.
**Additional Setup**
* Install Heroku CLI: `brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku` (macOS).
* Add SSL certificates: Use self-signed certificates for initial HTTPS setup.
* Configure Environment Variables on Heroku: Use `heroku config:set KEY=value` for essential keys.
**Other Cloud Platforms**
* **GCP**: Set up a GCP account, prepare your app with `app.yaml`, and deploy using `gcloud app deploy`.
* **AWS**: Use Elastic Beanstalk for deployment after setting up an AWS account and the AWS CLI.
* **Azure**: Deploy through Azure App Service after creating an Azure account and installing the Azure CLI.
#### Security and Best Practices
Before deployment, verify your `requirements.txt`, adjust configurations for production, and update OAuth redirect URIs.
### Application Code Notes
**@app.route('/') (Index Route):**
This route renders the index.html template when the root URL (/) is accessed. It serves as the homepage of your application.
**@app.route('/auth/rememberizer') (Rememberizer Authentication Route):**
This route initiates the OAuth2 authentication process with Rememberizer.ai. It generates a random state value, stores it in the session, constructs the authorization URL with the necessary parameters (client ID, redirect URI, scope, and state), and redirects the user to Rememberizer.ai's authorization page.
**@app.route('/auth/rememberizer/callback') (Rememberizer Callback Route):**
This route handles the callback from Rememberizer.ai after the user has authorized your application. It extracts the authorization code from the query parameters, exchanges it for an access token using Rememberizer.ai's token endpoint, and stores the access token in the session. Then, it redirects the user to the /dashboard route.
**@app.route('/dashboard') (Dashboard Route):**
This route displays the dashboard page to the user. It checks if the user has an access token in the session; if not, it redirects them to the authentication route. If the user is authenticated, it makes a request to Rememberizer.ai's account endpoint to retrieve account information and renders the dashboard.html template with this information.
**@app.route('/slack-info') (Slack Integration Info Route):**
This route shows information about the user's Slack integration with Rememberizer.ai. It checks for an access token and makes a request to Rememberizer.ai's integrations endpoint to get the integration data. It then renders the slack\_info.html template with this data.
**@app.route('/ask', methods=\['POST']) (Ask Route):**
This route handles the submission of questions from the user. It checks for an access token, retrieves the user's question from the form data, and makes a request to Rememberizer.ai's document search endpoint to find relevant information. It then uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate an answer based on the question and the search results. The answer is rendered in the answer.html template.
### Additional Notes
* **Iconography**: Designed with a detailed folded paper art style, reflecting AI and communication integration. Our icon was created in Midjourney and Image2Icon.
* **SSL Configuration**: Generate self-signed certificates using OpenSSL for secure communication.

# Vector Stores
The Rememberizer Vector Store simplifies the process of dealing with vector data, allowing you to focus on text input and leveraging the power of vectors for various applications such as search and data analysis.
### Introduction
The Rememberizer Vector Store is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for handling vector data. Unlike traditional vector databases like Pinecone, Rememberizer Vector Store allows you to work directly with text. The service will handle chunking, vectorizing, and storing the text data, making it easier for you to focus on your core application logic.
### Getting Started
#### Creating a Vector Store
1. Navigate to the Vector Stores Section in your dashboard
2. Click on "Create new Vector Store":
* A form will appear prompting you to enter details.
3. Fill in the Details:
* **Name**: Provide a unique name for your vector store.
* **Description**: Write a brief description of the vector store.
* **Data Schema**: Define the vector dimensions and any additional fields.
* You can optionally specify the embedding model, indexing strategy, and similarity metrics. These settings influence how vectors are generated and compared, optimizing performance for your specific use case.
4. Submit the Form:
* Click on the "Create" button. You will receive a success notification, and the new store will appear in your vector store list.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/create_vector_DB_store.png" alt="Create a New Vector Store"><figcaption><p>Create a New Vector Store</p></figcaption></figure>
#### Managing Vector Stores
1. View and Edit Vector Stores:
* Access the management dashboard to view, edit, or delete vector stores.
2. Viewing Documents:
* Browse individual documents and their associated metadata within a specific vector store.
3. Statistics:
* View detailed statistics such as the number of vectors stored, query performance, and operational metrics.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/vector_store_management.png" alt="View Details of a Vector Store"><figcaption><p>View Details of a Vector Store</p></figcaption></figure>
### API Key Management
API keys are used to authenticate and authorize access to the Rememberizer Vector Store's API endpoints. Proper management of API keys is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your vector stores. This section covers how to create and revoke API keys for your Vector Stores.
#### Creating API Keys
1. Head over to your Vector Store details page
2. Navigate to the API Key Management Section:
* It can be found within the "Configuration" tab
3. Click on **"Add API Key"**:
* A form will appear prompting you to enter details.
4. Fill in the Details:
* **Name**: Provide a name for the API key to help you identify its use case.
5. Submit the Form:
* Click on the "Create" button. The new API key will be generated and displayed. Make sure to copy and store it securely. This key is used to authenticate requests to that specific vector store.
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/vector_store_api_key.png" alt="Create a New API Key"><figcaption><p>Create a New API Key</p></figcaption></figure>
#### Revoking API Keys
If an API key is no longer needed, you can delete it to prevent any potential misuse.
For security reasons, you may want to rotate your API keys periodically. This involves generating a new key and revoking the old one.
### Retrieving Vector Store Information Using the API Key
After creating a new Vector Store and generating an API key, you can share this key with users who need access to the Vector Store. The API key allows users to upload documents, search documents, and perform other operations within the Vector Store. However, before users can interact with the Vector Store, they need to retrieve the Vector Store's ID and other related information using the API key.
Detail information for each API endpoint and response, visit the [vector-store](api-documentations/vector-store/ "mention") page.
***
Make sure to handle the API keys securely and follow best practices for API key management.
==> developer/authorizing-rememberizer-apps.md <==
# Authorizing Rememberizer apps
Rememberizer's implementation supports the standard [authorization code grant type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).
The web application flow to authorize users for your app is as follows:
1. Users are redirected to Rememberizer to authorize their account.
2. The user chooses mementos to use with your application.
3. Your application accesses the API with the user's access token.
Visit [#explore-third-party-apps-and-service](../personal/manage-third-party-apps.md#explore-third-party-apps-and-service "mention") page to see the UI example of the flow.
### Step 1. Request a user's Rememberizer identity
Redirect the user to the Rememberizer authorization server to initiate the authentication and authorization process.
||CODE_BLOCK||
GET https://api.rememberizer.ai/api/v1/auth/oauth2/authorize/
||CODE_BLOCK||
Parameters:
<table><thead><tr><th width="236">name</th><th>description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>client_id</td><td><strong>Required</strong><br>The client ID for your application. You can find this value in the Developer. Click <strong>Developer</strong> on the top-left corner. In the list of registered apps, click on your app and you will see the client ID in <strong>App Credentials.</strong></td></tr><tr><td>response_type</td><td><strong>Required</strong><br>Must be <code>code</code> for authorization code grants.</td></tr><tr><td>scope</td><td><p><strong>Optional</strong></p><p>A space-delimited list of scopes that identify the resources that your application could access on the user's behalf.</p></td></tr><tr><td>redirect_uri</td><td><strong>Required</strong><br>The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization.</td></tr><tr><td>state</td><td><p><strong>Required</strong></p><p>An opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and callback. The authorization server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back to the client.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
### Step 2. User choose and config their mementos
Users will choose which mementos to use with your app.
### Step 3. Users are redirected back to your site by Rememberizer
After users select their mementos, Rememberizer redirects back to your site with a temporary `code` parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a `state` parameter. The temporary code will expire after a short time. If the states don't match, a third party created the request, and you should abort the process.
### Step 4. Exchange authorization code for refresh and access tokens
||CODE_BLOCK||
POST https://api.rememberizer.ai/api/v1/auth/oauth2/token/
||CODE_BLOCK||
This endpoint takes the following input parameters.
<table><thead><tr><th width="165">name</th><th>description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>client_id</td><td><strong>Required</strong><br>The client ID for your application. You can find this value in the Developer. Instruction to find this ID is in step 1.</td></tr><tr><td>client_secret</td><td><strong>Required</strong><br>The client secret you received from Rememberizer for your application.</td></tr><tr><td>code</td><td>The authorization code you received in step 3.</td></tr><tr><td>redirect_uri</td><td><strong>Required</strong><br>The URL in your application where users are sent after authorization. Must match with the redirect_uri in step 1.</td></tr></tbody></table>
### Step 5. Use the access token to access the API
The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a user's behalf.
||CODE_BLOCK||
Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN
GET https://api.rememberizer.ai/api/me/
||CODE_BLOCK||
For example, in curl you can set the Authorization header like this:
||CODE_BLOCK||shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.rememberizer.ai/api/me/
||CODE_BLOCK||

# API documentations
You can authenticate APIs using either [OAuth2](../authorizing-rememberizer-apps.md) or [API keys](../registering-and-using-api-keys.md). OAuth2 is a standard authorization framework that enables applications to securely access specific documents within a system. On the other hand, API keys provide a simpler method to retrieve documents from a common knowledge base without the need to undergo the OAuth2 authentication process.
