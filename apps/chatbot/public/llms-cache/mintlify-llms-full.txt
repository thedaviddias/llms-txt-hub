# Editor Permissions
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/dashboard/permissions

Allow more members of your team to update your docs

The team member who created your initial docs will have update access to your docs, as long as they push to your documentation repo with the same GitHub account that was used while signing up for Mintlify.

If another editor attempts to update the docs while on the free plan, you will see a warning in your git commit check.

<Frame>
  <img className="rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor-gate.png" />
</Frame>

In the details of the git check warning, you'll find the link to upgrade your plan. You can also upgrade your plan on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to enable unlimited editors to update your docs. Once you upgrade your plan, trigger a manual update or push another change to deploy your updates.

    Run the following command to install the server: `bash npx mcp add [your
        subdomain] `
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the authentication token if applicable">
    If your API requires an authentication token, tell your end-customer to get
    it and apply it when given this response: `> What is the Authorization
        (basic token)?` Otherwise, you can skip this step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your MCP server">
    You can now run: `bash npm --prefix ~/.mcp/[your subdomain] start `
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Quickstart
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/mcp/quickstart

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) simplifies how you provide tools to LLMs

## Introduction

The MCP Generator is a CLI tool that generates an MCP server based on your company's documentation & OpenAPI specification if available. It takes in your documentation and a OpenAPI spec and outputs an MCP server that can be used with any MCP client. The MCP Generator is delivered via [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp) and generates an MCP server that can be used with any MCP client.

Mintlify enables you to create an MCP server that allows AI tools to interact with your docs in these key scenarios:

1. **Docs Q\&A**, similar to our AI Chat. This is automatically enabled for your docs, no setup required.
2. **Real-time API querying**, if you have an OpenAPI spec, head to the `Mintlify Dashboard > Products > MCP Server` and hit the toggle to enable your OpenAPI spec.
   <Note>
     By enabling the OpenAPI toggle, you are allowing the MCP server to access
     **all** endpoints in your OpenAPI spec.
   </Note>

## Install the MCP server

<Tip>
  This page is dedicated to the Mintlify MCP Server. If you are looking for information on generating your MCP, please refer to the [MCP Generator](/advanced/mcp/generate) page.
</Tip>

## Example installation with the Mintlify MCP server

To use the Mintlify MCP server you will need an [API key](https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/rest-api/overview#authentication) from your Mintlify account. If you don't have one, navigate to `Settings > API Keys > Chat API Key` and create a new key.

## Start the MCP server locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the server through the CLI">
    Run the following command to install the server:

    ```bash
    npx mcp add mintlify
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the authentication token">
    The following response will be given after running the previous command:

    ```
    > What is the Authorization (basic token)?
    ```

    Using your API chat key, copy the authentication token and paste it into the CLI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your MCP server">
    You can now run:

    ```bash
    npm --prefix ~/.mcp/mintlify start
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use your server with Claude

<Note>
  Download the [Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download)
</Note>

Once you have the Claude Desktop App installed, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Settings > Developer" />

  <Step title="Click on Edit Config">

## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

<Info>
  While the primary use-case will be to trigger updates, we will be adding more and more
  functionality to the API overtime. Let us know what else you want to see in
  [our community](https://mintlify.com/community)!
</Info>

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is
associated with the entire org and can be used across multiple deployments.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/external-api-key.png" />
</Frame>

## Admin API key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates via the [Update endpoint](/advanced/rest-api/update/trigger).

## Chat API key

The Chat API allows you to embed the AI chat experience grounded in your docs and continually kept up to date into any application of your choosing.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

<Note>
  The Chat API token is a public token that can be referenced in your
  frontend code whereas the API key is a server-side token that should be kept
  secret.
</Note>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use
the API for AI chat. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).


# Get the status of an update
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/rest-api/update/status

GET /project/update-status/{statusId}



# Trigger an update
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/rest-api/update/trigger

POST /project/update/{projectId}
Trigger an update after updating your OpenAPI document by calling this endpoint in a CI check.



# Cloudflare
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/subpath/cloudflare

Host documentation at a /docs subpath using Cloudflare Workers

## Create Cloudflare Worker

Navigate to the `Workers & Pages > Create application > Create worker`. You
should be presented with the following screen where you can create a new
Cloudlfare worker.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create a Cloudflare worker" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudflare/worker.png" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Keep in mind: If your DNS provider is Cloudflare you should not use proxying for the CNAME record
</Warning>

### Add custom domain

Once the worker is created, click `Configure worker`. Navigate to the worker
`Settings > Triggers`. Click on `Add Custom Domain` to add your desired domain
into the list - we recommend you add both the version with and without `www.`
prepended to the domain.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Cloudflare worker custom domain" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudflare/custom-domain.png" />
</Frame>

If you have trouble setting up a custom subdirectory,
[contact our support team](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) and we'll walk you through
upgrading your hosting with us.

### Edit Worker Script

Click on `Edit Code` and add the following script into the worker's code.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Cloudflare edit code" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudflare/edit-code.png" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Edit `DOCS_URL` by replacing `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain and
  `CUSTOM_URL` with your website's base URL.
</Tip>

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Then Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";

      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;

      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);

      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");

      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // if no action found, play the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
}
```

Click on `Deploy` and wait for the changes to propagate (it can take up to a few
hours).


# AWS Route 53 and Cloudfront
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/subpath/route53-cloudfront

Host documentation at a /docs subdirectory using AWS services

## Create Cloudfront Distribution

Navigate to [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) inside the AWS console and click on `Create distribution`

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Create Distribution](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/create-distribution.png)
</Frame>

For the Origin domain, input `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev` where `[SUBDOMAIN]` is the project's unique subdomain. Click on `Use: [SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev`

<Frame>![Cloudfront Origin name](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/origin-name.png)</Frame>

For **Cache key and origin requests**, select `Caching Optimized`.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Caching policy](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/caching-policy.png)
</Frame>

And for **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, enable security protections

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Caching
  policy](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/enable-security-protections.png)
</Frame>

The remaining settings should be default. Click `Create distribution`.

## Add Default Origin

After creating the distribution, navigate to the `Origins` tab.

<Frame>![Cloudfront Origins](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/origins.png)</Frame>

We want to find a staging URL that mirrors where the main domain (example.com). This is highly variant depending on how your landing page is hosted.

<Info>
  For instance, if your landing page is hosted on Webflow, you can use the
  Webflow's staging URL. It would look like `.webflow.io`.

  If you use Vercel, you use the `.vercel.app` domain available for every project.
</Info>

<Note>
  If you're unsure on how to get a staging URL for your landing page, [contact
  support](mailto:support@mintlify.com) and we'd be happy to help
</Note>

Once you have the staging URL, ours for instance is [mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app](https://mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app), create a new Origin and add it as the **Origin domain**.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Default Origins](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/default-origin.png)
</Frame>

By this point, you should have two Origins - one with `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app` and another with with staging URL.

## Set Behaviors

Behaviors in Cloudfront enables control over the subpath logic. At a high level, we're looking to create the following logic.

* **If a user lands on /docs**, go to `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev`
* **If a user lands on any other page**, go the current landing page

We're going to create three behaviors by clicking on the `Create behavior` button.

### `/docs/*`

The first behavior should have a **Path pattern** of `/docs/*` with **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the `.mintlify.dev` URL (in our case `acme.mintlify.dev`)

<Frame>![Cloudfront Behavior 1](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/behavior-1.png)</Frame>

For **Cache policy**, select `CachingOptimized` and create behavior.

### `/docs`

The second behavior should be the same as the first one but with a **Path pattern** of `/docs` and **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the same `.mintlify.dev` URL.

<Frame>![Cloudfront Behavior 2](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/behavior-2.png)</Frame>

### `Default (*)`

Lastly, we're going to edit the `Default (*)` behavior.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Behavior Default 1](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/default-behavior-1.png)
</Frame>

We're going to change the default behavior's **Origin and origin groups** to the staging URL (in our case `mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app`).

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Behavior Default 2](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/default-behavior-2.png)
</Frame>

Click on `Save changes`.

## Preview Distribution

You can now test if your distribution is set up properly by going to the `General` tab and visiting the **Distribution domain name** URL.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Preview
  distribution](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/preview-distribution.png)
</Frame>

All pages should be directing to your main landing page, but if you append `/docs` to the URL, you should see it going to the Mintlify documentation instance.

## Connecting it with Route53

Now, we're going to bring the functionality of the Cloudfront distribution into your primary domain.

<Note>
  For this section, you can also refer to AWS's official guide on [Configuring
  Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to a CloudFront
  distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html#routing-to-cloudfront-distribution-config)
</Note>

Navigate to [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) inside the AWS console, and click into the `Hosted zone` for your primary domain. Click on `Create record`

<Frame>
  ![Route 53 create record](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/route53-create-record.png)
</Frame>

Toggle `Alias` and then **Route traffic to** the `Alias to CloudFront distribution` option.

<Frame>
  ![Route 53 create record alias](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/cloudfront/create-record-alias.png)
</Frame>

Click `Create records`.

<Note>
  You may need to remove the existing A record if one currently exists.
</Note>

And voila! You should be able to have your documentation served at `/docs` for your primary domain.


# Vercel
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/subpath/vercel

Host documentation at a /docs subpath using Vercel

## vercel.json Configuration

To host your documentation at a custom subpath using Vercel, you need to add the
following configuration to your `vercel.json` file.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/docs",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs"
    },
    {
      "source": "/docs/:match*",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs/:match*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  For more information, you can also refer to Vercel's offical guide on
  rewrites: [Project Configuration:
  Rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#rewrites)
</Note>


# Authentication
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/authentication

You can set authentication parameters to let users use their real API keys.

## Enabling Authentication

You can add an authentication method to your docs.json to enable it on every page or you can set it on a per-page basis.

The page's authentication method will override docs.json if both are set.

### Bearer Token

<CodeGroup>
  ```json docs.json
  "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "auth": {
          "method": "bearer"
        }
      }
  }
  ```

  ```md Page Metadata
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "bearer"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Basic Authentication

<CodeGroup>
  ```json docs.json
  "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "auth": {
          "method": "basic"
        }
      }
  }
  ```

  ```md Page Metadata
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "basic"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### API Key

<CodeGroup>
  ```json docs.json
  "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key"
        }
      }
  }
  ```

  ```md Page Metadata
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "key"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### None

The "none" authentication method is useful to disable authentication on a specific endpoint after setting a default in docs.json.

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Page Metadata
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "none"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# MDX Setup
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration

Generate docs pages for your API endpoints using MDX

Mintlify allows you to define your API endpoints using a combination of `docs.json` configuration, MDX metadata fields, and the `<ParamFields />` component. From the defined endpoints, we generate an API playground, request examples, and response examples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API">
    In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and auth method:

    ```json
     "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "server": "https://mintlify.com/api", // string array for multiple base URLs
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key" // options: bearer, basic, key.
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you would not like to show an API playground, you don't need to include auth types. Hide the playground with the following field:

    ```json
    "api": {
      "playground": {
        "display": "none"
      }
    }
    ```

    Find a full list of API configurations [here](/settings/global#param-api).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your endpoint pages">
    Each API endpoint page should have a corresponding MDX file. At the top of each file, define:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    ---
    ```

    You can specify path parameters by adding the parameter name to the path, wrapped with `{}`:

    ```bash
    https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```

    <Note>
      If you have `server` configured in [docs.json](/settings/global), you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.
    </Note>

    You can also override the globally-defined display mode for the API playground per page by adding `playground` at the top of the MDX file:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    playground: 'none'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your endpoints to your docs">
    Add your endpoint pages to the sidebar by adding the paths to the `navigation` field in your `docs.json`. Learn more about structuring your docs [here](/settings/navigation).
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Advanced Features

Support for advanced OpenAPI features

OpenAPI 3 has some advanced features for describing complex APIs. Here's how you can use them with Mintlify.

## `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`

For complex datatypes, OpenAPI provides the `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` keywords, allowing you to combine schemas in certain ways. You can read more about these keywords in the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/), but essentially:

* `oneOf` functions like an "exclusive-or" operator
* `anyOf` functions like an "or" operator
* `allOf` functions like an "and" operator

<Warning>The `oneOf` and `anyOf` keywords are treated the same. We have found that, when people use `oneOf`, they often *mean* `anyOf` - and there is often no meaningful difference to the user.</Warning>

<Info>The `not` keyword is not currently supported.</Info>

### Combining schemas with `allOf`

Mintlify performs some preprocessing on your OpenAPI document to display these complex combinations in a readable way. For example, when you combine two object schemas with `allOf`, Mintlify combines the properties of both into a single object. This becomes especially useful when leveraging [OpenAPI's reusable `components`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/).

```yaml
org_with_users:
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Org'
    - type: object
      properties:
        users:
          type: array
          description: An array containing all users in the organization
...
components:
  schemas:
    Org:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: The ID of the organization
```

<ParamField body="org_with_users" type="object">
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The ID of the organization
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="users" type="object[]">
      An array containing all users in the organization
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Providing options with `oneOf` and `anyOf`

When you use `oneOf` or `anyOf`, Mintlify displays the options in a tabbed container. To give your options helpful names, make sure to give each subschema a `title` field. For example, here's how you might display two different types of delivery addresses:

```yaml
delivery_address:
  oneOf:
    - title: StreetAddress
      type: object
      properties:
        address_line_1:
          type: string
          description: The street address of the recipient
        ...
    - title: POBox
      type: object
      properties:
        box_number:
          type: string
          description: The number of the PO Box
        ...
```

<ParamField body="delivery_address" type="object">
  <div className="mt-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-100 px-4 pb-4 pt-2 dark:border-white/10">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="StreetAddress">
        <ParamField body="address_line_1" type="string">
          The street address of the residence
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="POBox">
        <ParamField body="box_number" type="string">
          The number of the PO Box
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</ParamField>

## `x-codeSamples`

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can add code samples to your OpenAPI document, and Mintlify will display them in your OpenAPI pages. You can define your code samples using the `x-codeSamples` extension. This property can be added within any request method, and has the following schema:

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here's an example of some code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```


# OpenAPI Setup
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup

Reference OpenAPI endpoints in your docs pages

## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To describe your endpoints with OpenAPI, make sure you have a valid OpenAPI
document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the
[OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). Your document must
follow OpenAPI specification 3.0+.
<Tip>To validate your OpenAPI spec, use our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) and run this command: <br />`mintlify openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`</Tip>

## Auto-populate API pages

The fastest way to get started with OpenAPI is to add an `openapi` field to a tab in the `docs.json`. This field can contain either the path to an OpenAPI document in your docs repo, or the URL of a hosted OpenAPI document. Mintlify will automatically generate a page for each OpenAPI operation and place them in the tab.

**Example with Tabs:**

```json {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/autogeneration-with-tabs.png)

**Example with Groups:**

```json {8-11}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Endpoints",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/openapi-1.json",
            "directory": "api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When using this option, the metadata for the generated pages will have the following default values:

* `title`: The `summary` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. Otherwise a title generated from the HTTP method and endpoint.

* `description`: The `description` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present.

* `version`: The `version` value from the anchor or tab, if present.

There are some scenarios in which the default behavior isn't sufficient. If you need more customizability, you can create an MDX page for your OpenAPI operation, and modify it just like any other MDX page.

## Create MDX files for API pages

If you want to customize the page metadata, add additional content, omit certain OpenAPI operations, or reorder OpenAPI pages in your navigation, you'll need an MDX page for each operation. Here is [an example MDX OpenAPI page](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/docs/rest/databases/create-databases.mdx) from [MindsDB](https://docs.mindsdb.com/rest/databases/create-databases).&#x20;

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/mindsdb.png)

### Manually specify files

You can always create an MDX page manually, and reference the OpenAPI operation in the page's metadata using the `openapi` field.

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses,
and the API playground will be automatically generated from the OpenAPI document.

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the path to the OpenAPI file to ensure Mintlify finds the correct OpenAPI document. This is not required if you have
only one OpenAPI file - it will automatically detect your OpenAPI file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Example
  ---
  title: "Get users"
  openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
  ---
  ```

  ```md Format
  ---
  title: "title of the page"
  openapi: openapi-file-path method path
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>
  In most cases, the method and path must match the method and path specified
  in the OpenAPI document exactly. If the endpoint doesn't exist in the OpenAPI
  file, the page will be empty.

  For webhooks, replace the method (i.e. "POST") with "webhook" (case insensitive)
  and the correct method will be generated.
</Note>

### Autogenerate files

For large OpenAPI documents, creating one MDX page for each OpenAPI operation can be a lot of work. To make it easier, we created a local OpenAPI page scraper.

Our Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping)
autogenerates MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints.

Each generated page will correspond to an OpenAPI operation under the "paths" section of the OpenAPI schema.
If your OpenAPI document is version 3.1+, the scraper will also generate pages for webhooks under the "webhooks" section of the OpenAPI schema.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
```

Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is
not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

Learn more about our scraping package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

The scraper will output an array of
[Navigation entries](/settings/global#structure) containing your OpenAPI MDX
files. You can either append these entries to your existing Navigation, or
reorder and add the files to your navigation manually.

<Note>
  If your OpenAPI document is invalid, the files will not autogenerate.
</Note>

## Create MDX files for OpenAPI schemas

Mintlify also allows you to create individual pages for any OpenAPI schema
defined in an OpenAPI document's `components.schemas` field:

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Example
  ---
  openapi-schema: OrderItem
  ---
  ```

  ```md Format
  ---
  openapi-schema: "schema-key"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Writing OpenAPI
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi

Use OpenAPI features to enhance your documentation

## Describing your API

There are many great tools online for learning about and constructing OpenAPI documents. Here are our favorites:

* [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) for familiarizing yourself with the OpenAPI syntax
* [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) for all the details about the newest OpenAPI specification
* [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://editor.swagger.io/) for debugging your OpenAPI document
* [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) for seeing examples in action

<Note>
  Swagger's OpenAPI Guide is for OpenAPI v3.0, but nearly all of the information is applicable to v3.1. For more information on the differences between v3.0 and v3.1, check out [OpenAPI's blog post](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).
</Note>

## Specifying the URL for your API

In an OpenAPI document, different API endpoints are specified by their paths, like `/users/{id}`, or maybe simply `/`. To specify the base URL to which these paths should be appended, OpenAPI provides the `servers` field. This field is necessary to use some Mintlify features like the API Playground. Read how to configure the `servers` field in the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/).

The API Playground will use these server URLs to determine where to send requests. If multiple servers are specified, a dropdown will appear to allow toggling between servers. If no server is supplied, the API Playground will use simple mode, as there is no way to send a request.

If different endpoints within your API exist at different URLs, you can [override the server field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/#:~:text=%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%2D%20southeastasia-,Overriding%20Servers,-The%20global%20servers) for a given path or operation.

## Specifying authentication

Nearly all APIs require some method of authentication. OpenAPI provides the `securitySchemes` field for defining the methods of authentication used throughout your API, with simple configuration for the most common authentication types - [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/), [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/). To apply these authentication methods to your endpoints, OpenAPI uses the `security` field. The syntax for defining and applying authentication is a bit unintuitive, so definitely check out [Swagger's documentation and examples](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) on the topic.

The API descriptions and API Playground will add authentication fields based on the security configurations in your OpenAPI document.

If different endpoints within your API require different methods of authentication, you can [override the security field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for a given operation.

# Troubleshooting
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/troubleshooting

Common issues with API References

API pages are complicated. As a result, there are a lot of things that can go wrong.
Here's a list of common issues we've seen customers run into:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    In this scenario, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mintlify dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.

    To verify your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the exact validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
    passes validation here, there's a great chance the problem is elsewhere.

    Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) (under Edit > Convert to OpenAPI 3):

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/convert-oas-3.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure
    the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.

    Here's an example of how things might go wrong:

    ```md get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
    ---
    ```

    ```yaml openapi.yaml
    paths:
      "/users/{id}":
        get: ...
    ```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:

    ```md api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
    ---
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
    default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
    `/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
    requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
    allow `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path.

    Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure
    Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.disableProxy`
    setting in the `docs.json`, as described [here](/settings/global#api-configurations). This will
    likely require you to configure CORS on your server, as these requests will now come directly
    from your users' browsers.
  </Accordion>

# Code Blocks
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/code

Display code with optional syntax highlighting

<RequestExample>
  ````md Code Block Example
  ```javascript Code Block Example
  const hello = "world";
  ```
  ````
</RequestExample>

## Basic Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks.

```
helloWorld();
```

````md
```
helloWorld();
```
````

## Syntax Highlighting

Put the name of your programming language after the three backticks to get syntax highlighting.

We use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) for syntax highlighting. [Test Drive Prism](https://prismjs.com/test.html#language=markup) lists all the languages supported.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

## Names

Add a title after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```

````md Code Block Example
```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```
````

## Line Highlighting

Highlight specific lines in your code blocks by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```

````md
```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```
````

## Expandable

If you have a long code block and `[expandable]` after your title to make it close and expand.

```python library.py [expandable]

# Code Groups
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/code-groups

The CodeGroup component lets you combine code blocks in a display separated by tabs

You will need to make [Code Blocks](/content/components/code) then add the `<CodeGroup>` component around them. Every Code Block must have a filename because we use the names for the tab buttons.

See below for an example of the end result.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript helloWorld.js
  console.log("Hello World");
  ```

  ```python hello_world.py
  print('Hello World!')
  ```

  ```java HelloWorld.java
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }

# Sidebar Code Examples
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/sticky-examples

Display code blocks at the top-right of the page on desktop devices

The `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` stick code blocks to the top-right of a page even as you scroll. The components work on all pages even if you don't use an API playground.

`<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` show up like regular code blocks on mobile.

## Request Example

The `<RequestExample>` component works similar to [CodeGroup](/content/components/code-groups), but displays the request content on the right sidebar. Thus, you can put multiple code blocks inside `<RequestExample>`.

Please set a name on every code block you put inside RequestExample.

<RequestExample>
  ````md RequestExample Example
  <RequestExample>

  ```bash Request
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts
  ```

  </RequestExample>
  ````
</RequestExample>

## Response Example

The `<ResponseExample>` component is the same as `<RequestExample>` but will show up underneath it.

<ResponseExample>
  ````md ResponseExample Example
  <ResponseExample>

  ```json Response
  { "status": "success" }
  ```

  </ResponseExample>
  ````
</ResponseExample>

# Local Development
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/development

Preview changes locally to update your docs

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

**Step 1**: Install the Mintlify CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Alternatively, if you do not want to install the CLI globally you can use a run script available:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Yarn's "dlx" run script requires yarn version >2. See [here](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx) for more information.
</Warning>

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img className="rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/checks-passed.png" />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Could not load the &#x22;sharp&#x22; module using the darwin-arm64 runtime">
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


# Images, Videos, and Embeds
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/image-embeds

Add image, video, and other HTML elements

<img className="rounded-xl" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/bigbend.jpg" />

<Info>
  Mintlify supports files up to 5 MB. To use larger files, consider a storage
  service like Cloudinary and embed in your documentation using the URL.
</Info>

## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use embeds to add images.

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Disable Image Zoom

To disable the default zoom on click for images, add the noZoom property to image embeds.

```html
<img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Linking Images

To link an image, for example to create a button on your docs, encompass the image in a link with the `noZoom` property. Images in `a` tags will automatically have a pointer cursor.

```html
<a href="https://mintlify.com" target="_blank">
  <img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
</a>
```

### Dark Mode

To use separate images for light and dark mode, use Tailwind CSS to hide and show images.

```html
<img className="block h-32 dark:hidden" src="/path/image-light.jpg" />
<img className="hidden h-32 dark:block" src="/path/image-dark.jpg" />
```

### Related

For more information, we recommend the following sections:

</Card>

## Videos

<iframe className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen />

<br />

<Tip>
  Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.
</Tip>

For YouTube videos use:

```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

For other videos, use:

```html
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="link-to-your-video.com"
></video>
```

To autoplay the video, use:

```html
<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="link-to-your-video.com"
></video>
```

<Warning>
  Since Mintlify needs to adhere to the JSX syntax, double word attributes will need to
  be written in camelCase: autoPlay, playsInline.
</Warning>

## iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"> </iframe>
```

<Tip>
  Although not required, we recommend adding the `alt` and `title` attributes to
  images for better SEO and accessability. Learn more at [image
  SEO](https://yoast.com/image-seo-alt-tag-and-title-tag-optimization/).

# Google Analytics 4
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/analytics/google-analytics



You will need to generate a new <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> property to use with Mintlify. The data collected will go into the same project as your other Google Analytics data.

If you are using the old version of Google Analytics, Universal Analytics, you will still be able to generate a <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> property. <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> data is slightly different from UA data but still gets collected in the same project.

## How to Connect GA4 to Mintlify

### Create a Web Stream

You will need to create a web stream to get the Measurement ID to put into Mintlify.

Click the cog at the bottom left of the Google Analytics screen. Then click on Data Streams.

<Frame>![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/ga4-web-streams.png)</Frame>

Create a Web Stream and put the URL of your Mintlify docs site as the stream URL.

Your Measurement ID looks like `G-XXXXXXX` and will show up under Stream Details immediately after you create the Web Stream.

### Put Measurement ID in docs.json

Add your Measurement ID to your `docs.json` file like so:

```json docs.json
"integrations": {
    "ga4": {
        "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXX"
    }
}
```

### Wait

Google Analytics takes two to three days to show your data.

You can use the [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) to check analytics are enabled correctly. The extension will log to your browser's console every time GA4 makes a request.

<Note>
  Preview links have analytics turned off.

    "osano": "SOURCE"
  }
```

If you'd like to request a data privacy platform integration, please let us know in [our community](https://mintlify.com/community).

## Cookie Consent and Disabling Telemetry

If you need to check if a user has already consented to cookies for GDPR compliance, you can specify a local storage key and value under `cookies`:

```json
  "integrations": {
    "cookies": {
      "key": "LOCAL STORAGE KEY",
      "value": "LOCAL STORAGE VALUE"
    }
  }
```

If these values are set, local storage will be checked to see if the user has consented to cookies. If they have not, telemetry will be disabled.

If you'd like to disable telemetry for all users, you can add the following to your `docs.json` file:

```json
  "integrations": {
    "telemetry": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
```


# Speakeasy
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/sdks/speakeasy

Automate your SDK usage snippets in the API playground

You can integrate Speakeasy-generated code snippets from your SDKs directly into your Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the [interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of your Mintlify-powered documentation.

## Speakeasy SDK Repository Changes

In your Speakeasy SDK repos, add the following to the `targets` section of your `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` file to ensure code samples are automatically produced alongside SDK generations.

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    target: typescript
    source: my-source
    codeSamples:
      output: codeSamples.yaml
```

Code samples will be generated in the form of an [OpenAPI overlay file](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/openapi/overlays) that will be used in the Mintlify docs repository.

## Mintlify Docs Repository Changes

The workflow files produced will automatically bundle your source OpenAPI spec and Speakeasy code samples into a single output file, `openapi.yaml`. Mintlify will use this output file when constructing your API reference.

### Interactive CLI Set Up

Run the following commands to set up the `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` and `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml` files through the interactive Speakeasy CLI.

```bash
speakeasy configure sources
speakeasy configure github
```

Set up your source spec. The source spec is the OpenAPI spec that code samples will be generated for, and it's often the same specification used to power Mintlify docs.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/speakeasy-1.webp)

Add the overlay created by Speakeasy to inject code snippets into your spec.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/speakeasy-2.webp)

Provide a name and path for the OpenAPI spec. This will be the final spec used by Mintlify.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/speakeasy-3.webp)

Finally, Add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under `Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions`. Find the Speakeasy API key in the Speakeasy dashboard under the **API Keys** tab.

## Manual Set Up

Alternatively, you can manually set up the following files in your Mintlify docs repo.

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
sources:
  docs-source:
    inputs:
      - location: {{your_api_spec}} # local or remote references supported
    overlays:
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_1}}/codeSamples.yaml
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_2}}/codeSamples.yaml
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_3}}/codeSamples.yaml
    output: openapi.yaml
targets: {}
```

```yaml .speakeasy/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml
name: Generate
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
      speakeasy_version: latest
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

Finally, make sure you add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under `Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions`. Find the Speakeasy API key in the Speakeasy dashboard under the **API Keys** tab.


# Stainless
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/sdks/stainless

Automate your SDK example snippets in the API playground

If you use Mintlify's OpenAPI support for your API reference documentation, add the following to your Stainless config:

```yaml openapi.stainless.yml
openapi:
  code_samples: mintlify
```

Configure the [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi/setup#in-the-repo) in your Mintlify docs. To integrate Stainless, modify the GitHub Action that uploads your OpenAPI spec to Stainless so that it pushes the Stainless-enhanced OpenAPI spec into your docs repo like so:

```yaml
name: Upload OpenAPI spec to Stainless and (Mintlify) docs repo

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  stainless:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Push spec and config to Stainless and outputs documented spec
        uses: stainless-api/upload-openapi-spec-action@main
        with:
          input_path: 'path/to/my-company-openapi.json'
          config_path: 'path/to/my-company.stainless.yaml'
          output_path: 'path/to/my-company-openapi.documented.json'
          project_name: 'my-stainless-project'
      - name: Push documented spec to docs repo
        uses: dmnemec/copy_file_to_another_repo_action@main
        env:
          API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB }}
        with:
          source_file: 'config/my-company-openapi.documented.json'
          destination_repo: '{DOCS_REPO_NAME}'
          destination_folder: 'openapi-specs' # (optional) the folder in the destination repository to place the file in, if not the root directory
          user_email: '{EMAIL}' # the email associated with the GH token
          user_name: '{USERNAME}' # the username associated with the GH token
          commit_message: 'Auto-updates from Stainless'
```

This assumes the following secrets have been [uploaded to your GitHub Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions):

* `secrets.STAINLESS_API_KEY`: Your Stainless API key.
* `secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB`: A GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with permissions to push to your docs repo.

## Enabling Support Integrations

You can integrate widgets onto your docs for customer support. Add the `integrations` field into your `docs.json` file with your respective app ID.

```json
  "integrations": {
    "intercom": "APP_ID",
    "frontchat": "CHAT_ID"
  }
```

If you'd like to request a customer support integration, please let us know in [our community](https://join.slack.com/t/mintlify-users/shared_invite/zt-1xfzz6x35-f4o4WCYfpvLhSj3O7WAOMA).


# Lists and Tables
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/list-table

Display information in lists and tables

## Lists

### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested List

Add indents on list items to nest them

* First item
* Second item
  * Additional item
  * Additional item
* Third item

```md
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

<Tip>
  Lists follow the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1).
</Tip>

## Tables

| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |

### Creating a table

<Tip>
  The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).
</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```md
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |
```

# Tabs, Anchors, Dropdowns
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation/divisions



## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your
documentation.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/tabs-light.png" />

  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/tabs-dark.png" />
</Frame>

```json docs.json
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API References",
      "pages": [
        "api-reference/get",
        "api-reference/post",
        "api-reference/delete"
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "SDKs",
      "pages": [
        "sdk/fetch",
        "sdk/create",
        "sdk/delete",
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "Blog",
      "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Anchors

Anchors are another way to section your content. They show up on top of your side navigation.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/anchor-light.png" />

  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/anchor-dark.png" />
</Frame>

The configuration is very similar to the tab configuration. We highly recommend that you set an `icon` field as well.
The icon values are [fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/search)

```json docs.json
"navigation": {
  "anchors": [
    {
      "anchor": "Documentation",
      "icon": "book-open",
      "pages": [
        "quickstart",
        "development",
        "navigation"
      ]
    }
    {
      "anchor": "API References",
      "icon": "sqaure-terminal",
      "pages": [
        "api-reference/get",
        "api-reference/post",
        "api-reference/delete"
      ]
    }
    {
      "anchor": "Blog",
      "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dropdowns

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/dropdowns-light.png" />

  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/dropdowns-dark.png" />
</Frame>

Dropdowns show up in the same place as anchors, but are consolidated into a single dropdown.
We also recommend that you set an icon for each dropdown item ([options](https://fontawesome.com/search)).

```json docs.json
"navigation": {
  "dropdowns": [
    {
      "dropdown": "Documentation",
      "icon": "book-open",
      "pages": [
        "quickstart",
        "development",
        "navigation"
      ]
    }
    {
      "dropdown": "API References",
      "icon": "sqaure-terminal",
      "pages": [
        "api-reference/get",
        "api-reference/post",
        "api-reference/delete"
      ]
    }
    {
      "dropdown": "Blog",
      "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Nested Hierarchy

You can use any combination of anchors, tabs, and dropdowns - either one can be nested within each other interchangeably.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Top-Level Anchors
  {
    "navigation": {
      "anchors": [
        {
          "anchor": "Anchor 1",
          "groups": [
            {
              "group": "Group 1",
              "pages": [
                "some-folder/file-1",
                "another-folder/file-2"
                "just-a-file"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        {
          "anchor": "Anchor 2",
          "groups": [
            {
              "group": "Group 2",
              "pages": [
                "some-other-folder/file-1",
                "various-different-folders/file-2",
                "another-file"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json Top-Level Tabs
  {
    "navigation": {
      "tabs": [
        {
          "tab": "Tab 1",
          "groups": [
            {
              "group": "Group 1",
              "pages": [
                "some-folder/file-1",
                "another-folder/file-2"
                "just-a-file"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        {
          "tab": "Tab 2",
          "groups": [
            {
              "group": "Group 2",
              "pages": [
                "some-other-folder/file-1",
                "various-different-folders/file-2",
                "another-file"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Localization
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation/localization



`"languages"` in your `docs.json` can be leveraged to partition your navigation into different languages.

We currently support localization in the following languages:

* Arabic (`ar`)
* Chinese (`cn` or `zh`, `zh-Hans` for Simplified and `zh-Hant` for Traditional)
* English (`en`)
* French (`fr`)
* German (`de`)
* Indonesian (`id`)
* Italian (`it`)
* Japanese (`jp` or `ja`)
* Korean (`ko`)
* Portuguese (`pt`)
* Portuguese (Brazil) (`pt-BR`)
* Russian (`ru`)
* Spanish (`es`)
* Turkish (`tr`)

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "language": "en",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["en/overview", "en/quickstart", "en/development"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "language": "es",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["es/overview", "es/quickstart", "es/development"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


# Overview
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation/overview

The `navigation` property controls the hierarchy of your documentation.

It can contain one of seven properties:

* `pages`
* `groups`
* `anchors`
* `tabs`
* `dropdowns`
* `versions`
* `languages`

These properties all serve the function of partitioning your content and creating a hierarchy so that it's
easier for your users to navigate through your documentation.

<Note>
  If you're currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the CLI:

  ```sh
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  And run the new `upgrade` command in your docs repository:

  ```sh
  mintlify upgrade
  ```

  This will generate a `docs.json` based off of your `mint.json`. Then, please delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
</Note>

<Info>
  If you want to learn more about the difference between `mint.json` and
  `docs.json` checkout our [blog](https://mintlify.com/blog/refactoring-mint-json-into-docs-json)
</Info>


# Pages and Groups
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation/pages



## Pages

If you don't want any hierarchy, you can just define pages within your `navigation` field.

Each entry of the `pages` array must be a path to a file that exists within your repo.
Note you do not need to append `.mdx` to the file paths.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "pages": [
      "overview",
      "quickstart",
      "advanced/components",
      "advanced/integrations"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Groups

Groups allow you to group your pages. Groups can also be nested within each other.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          {
            "group": "Editing",
            "icon": "pen-paintbrush",
            "pages": ["development", "web-editor"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Writing Content",
        "pages": ["writing-content/page", "writing-content/text"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


# Versions
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation/versions



`"versions"` in your `docs.json` can be leveraged to partition your navigation into different versions.

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "versions": [
      {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["v1/overview", "v1/quickstart", "v1/development"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["v2/overview", "v2/quickstart", "v2/development"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also add versioning to a specific section of your docs by nesting a version.

```json docs.json [expandable]
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Guides",
      "pages": ["overview", "quickstart"]
    },
    {
      "tab": "SDKs",
      "versions": [
        {
          "version": "latest",
          "anchors": [
            {
              "anchor": "Javascript",
              "pages": ["sdk/js/create", "sdk/js/edit", "sdk/js/delete"]
            },
            {
              "anchor": "Python",
              "pages": ["sdk/py/create", "sdk/py/edit", "sdk/py/delete"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


# Page Titles and Metadata
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/page

Setting the title and metadata for navigation and SEO

## The Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata syntax
with `---` at the start and end:

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Schema
  ---
  title: "title of the page"
  ---
  ```

  ```md Example
  ---
  title: "Page"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>
  Mintlify will use the name of the file if you forget to include a title.
</Tip>

Other metadata goes in between the same `---` lines. For example, this page uses
this metadata:

```md
---
title: "Page Titles and Metadata"
description: "Setting the title and metadata for navigation and SEO"
---
```

## Descriptions

You can show a description that shows directly under the title with the
`description` metadata.

```md
description: "Your description goes here."
```

## Sidebar Title

You can show a different title in the navigation with the `sidebarTitle`
metadata. This is useful if your title is long and you want something shorter in
the navigation links.

```md
---
title: "Your very long page title you want to shorten"
sidebarTitle: "Short title"
---
```

## Sidebar Icons

Want an icon for your sidebar item like the ones in
[components](/content/components/accordions)? You can set an `icon` attribute in
the metadata! All icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) are
available for us. You can also set an icon type (optional). If not set, the icon
type will be regular.

```md
---
title: "Code Block"
icon: "rectangle-code"
iconType: "solid"
---
```

## API Pages

API pages let you build interactive API playgrounds. To create an API page, you
must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata.

Learn more about API playgrounds in [our demo](/api-playground).

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Schema
  api or openapi: method endpoint
  ```

  ```md API Example
  api: "GET /users"
  ```

  ```md OpenAPI Example
  openapi: "GET /users"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Page Mode

The Page Mode setting allows you to customize the appearance of your page. You can choose from
different modes to adjust the layout according to your needs. If no mode is specified, the page
will use the default settings.

### Default

If no specific mode is given, the page will default to standard settings. This means the page
will display with the default table of contents (if headings are present) and other standard
elements, providing a typical layout without any special adjustments.

```md
---
title: "Page with no ToC"
---
```

### Wide Mode

In Wide Mode, you can hide the table of contents (ToC) on the right side of the page. This is
particularly useful if your page doesn’t have any headings or if you prefer to utilize the
extra horizontal space for other content.

```md
---
title: "Page with no ToC"
mode: "wide"
---
```

### Custom Mode

Custom Mode provides a minimalist layout by removing all elements except for the top bar.
This mode offers a blank canvas, which is ideal for creating a "landing page" or any page where
you want a clean, distraction-free environment.

```md
---
mode: "custom"
---
```

### Center Mode

Center Mode removes the sidebar and the table of contents, and centers the page content. This mode is great for changelogs
or any page where you want to focus on the content.

```md
---
mode: "center"
---
```

## External Links

If you want the sidebar to open an external URL, you can set the `url` metadata
in any page.

```md
---
title: "Page that goes to external link"
url: "https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify"
---
```

## Search Engine Optimization

You can set meta tags like the image set when shared on social media by passing
them into your page's metadata. Meta tags with colons need to be wrapped in
quotes.

```md
"twitter:image": "/images/your-photo.jpg"
```

See [our SEO page](/settings/seo) for all supported meta tags.

## Getting Started

Welcome! Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and
supercharge your documentation with Mintlify.

### Creating the Repository

Mintlify docs are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our
[starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). We use GitHub to integrate
your docs with your code, and make source control effortless. Onboard through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) or clone our [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) to get started.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install the GitHub app">
    Install our GitHub app to ensure that your updates are automatically deployed when you push changes. You can find the installation link in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings), on the Settings page. Upon successful installation, a check mark will appear next to the commit hash of the repository.

    <Frame>
      ![GitHub Bot Verification](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/github-bot-verification.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Monorepo Setup">
    If you want your docs to live alongside your code as a monorepo setup, you
    can: 1. Move your docs content to your monorepo. 2. Specify the path to your
    `docs.json` in the
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Updating the Content

Mintlify enables you to easily customize the style, structure, and content of
your docs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Editing locally (recommended for developers)">
    1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

# Reusable Snippets
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets

Reusable, custom snippets to keep content in sync

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself), which applies to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should create a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating a custom snippet

**Pre-condition**: You must create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory in order for the import to work.

Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
be rendered into a standalone page. If you want to create a standalone page
from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and call it as a
component.

### Default export

1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to re-use. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props
   when you import the snippet. In this example, our variable is word.

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. 
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file.

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet/>

```

### Exporting with variables

1. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props when you import the snippet. In this example, our variable is word.

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
My keyword of the day is {word}.
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file with the variable. The property will fill in based on your specification.

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />

```

### Reusable variables

1. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```typescript snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx
export const myName = 'my name';

export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```

### Reusable components

1. Inside your snippet file, create a component that takes in props by exporting
   your component in the form of an arrow function.

```typescript snippets/custom-component.mdx
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
  MDX does not compile inside the body of an arrow function. Stick to HTML
  syntax when you can or use a default export if you need to use MDX.
</Warning>

2. Import the snippet into your destination file and pass in the props

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from '/snippets/custom-component.mdx';

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />
```

### Client-Side Content

By default, Mintlify employs server-side rendering, generating content
at build time. For client-side content loading, ensure to verify the
`document` object's availability before initiating the rendering process.

```typescript snippets/client-component.mdx
{/* `setTimeout` simulates a React.useEffect, which is called after the component is mounted. */}
export const ClientComponent = () => {
  if (typeof document === "undefined") {
    return null;
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const clientComponent = document.getElementById("client-component");
      if (clientComponent) {
        clientComponent.innerHTML = "Hello, client-side component!";
      }
    }, 1);

    return <div id="client-component"></div>
  }
}
```


# Authentication
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication

Guarantee privacy of your docs by authenticating users

Authentication offers full privacy for all of your
documentation content by requiring users to authenticate before viewing any content, such as:

* Documentation page content
* Images used in documentation pages
* Search results
* AI chat interactions

You can authenticate users through handshake methods such as:

* [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
* [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt)
* [OAuth](./authentication-setup/oauth)
* [Mintlify dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Authentication is similar to our [Personalization](./personalization) offering, but with guaranteed privacy. In addition
to securing your documentation content, all features that are available via
Personalization are also available via Authentication.

Check out our docs for more info on [choosing Authentication vs Personalization](./authentication-vs-personalization).


# Choosing a Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/choosing-a-handshake

How to decide which Handshake method is right for your docs

<Info>
  This is the documentation for **Authentication** Handshake methods. Personalization offers a [different set of Handshake methods](/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/choosing-a-handshake).
</Info>

Before your users can access personalized content, they must be authenticated. Mintlify supports four Authentication Handshake methods:

1. **Password**: Configure a set of global passwords for your documentation site.
2. **JWT**: Use your own login flow to authenticate your users via a JWT in the URL.
3. **OAuth 2.0**: Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the standard Authorization Code flow.
4. **Mintlify Dashboard**: Allow all of your dashboard users to access your docs, zero configuration required.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password">
    * Your security requirements allow for password sharing between documentation readers.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT">
    * You have some existing login flow.
    * You can add a final step in this login flow that creates a JWT and redirects to the docs.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    * You have an existing OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code flow.
    * You can create a new API endpoint that can be accessed by the returned OAuth access token.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mintlify Dashboard">
    * Your documentation readers are also your documentation editors.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pros & Cons

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password">
    Pros:

    * Super simple setup
    * No configuration required for adding new users - just share the password

    Cons:

    * Difficult to revoke access to your docs without resetting the password
    * Lose personalization features, as there is no way to differentiate users with the same password
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT">
    Pros:

    * Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse
    * Zero CORS configuration
    * No restrictions on API URLs

    Cons:

    * Must be able to hook into your existing login flow
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    Pros:

    * Heightened security standard

    Cons:

    * Requires significant work if setting up OAuth server for the first time
    * Might be overkill for some applications
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mintlify Dashboard">
    Pros:

    * Zero-config setup

    Cons:

    * Requires all docs readers to have an account in your Mintlify dashboard
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


# JWT Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/jwt

Use a customized login flow to authenticate users

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the JWT **Authentication** Handshake. The steps for setting up the [JWT **Personalization** Handshake](/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/jwt) are slightly different.
</Info>

If you don’t have a dashboard, or if you want to keep your dashboard and docs completely separate, you can use your own login flow to authenticate users via a JWT in the URL.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key">
    Go to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and generate a private key. Store this key somewhere secure where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a login flow">
    Create a login flow that does the following:

    * Authenticate the user
    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the [User](../sending-data) format
    * Sign the JWT with the secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm
    * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Return to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add the login URL to your Authentication settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs
to be completely separate from my dashboard (or I don’t have a dashboard at all).

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and generate a
JWT secret. I create a web URL `https://foo.com/docs-login` that initiates a login flow
for my users. At the end of this login flow, once I have verified the identity of the user,
I create a JWT containing the user’s custom data according to Mintlify’s specification.
I use a JWT library to sign this JWT with my Mintlify secret, create a redirect URL of the
form `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`, and redirect the user.

I then go to the dashboard settings and enter `https://foo.com/docs-login` for the
Login URL field.

Here's what the code might look like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts TypeScript
  import * as jose from 'jose';
  import { Request, Response } from 'express';

  const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

  const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

  export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
    const user = {
      expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
      groups: res.locals.user.groups,
      content: {
        firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
        lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
      },
    };

    const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
      .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
      .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
      .sign(signingKey);

    return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
  }
  ```

  ```python Python
  import jwt # pyjwt
  import os

  from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

  private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

  @router.get('/auth')
  async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
    jwt_token = jwt.encode(
      payload={
        'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
        'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 1 week session expiration
        'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
        'content': {
          'firstName': current_user.first_name,
          'lastName': current_user.last_name,
        },
      },
      key=private_key,
      algorithm='EdDSA'
    )

    return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Redirecting Unauthenticated Users

When an unauthenticated user tries to access a specific page, Mintlify preserves their intended destination through a redirect flow:

1. The user attempts to visit a certain page (e.g., `/quickstart`)

2. Mintlify redirects them to your login URL and adds the (relative) original destination as a `redirect` query parameter

Example:

* Original request: [`https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`](https://docs.foo.com/quickstart)

* Redirect to login: [`https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`](https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart)

After successful authentication, you can include this same `redirect` parameter in your JWT callback URL to send users to their intended destination:
`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`


# Mintlify Auth Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/mintlify

Use Mintlify to authenticate users

<Info>
  The Mintlify Auth Handshake is available only for Authentication, *not*
  Personalization.
</Info>

You can use Mintlify to authenticate and manage access to your documentation. Anyone that can access your dashboard will automatically be able to see your documentation.

This handshake method also enables private preview deployments, so that only Mintlify authenticated users will be able to access your preview deployments.

<Note>
  Authentication is available only by request. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for access. After we've
  enabled access, you can follow the implementation instructions.
</Note>

### Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs
to be internal, and the people that will be viewing my docs are the same people that
contribute to my docs.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I can go to my [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication)
and enable Authentication with the Mintlify Auth Handshake.

I can then ensure that anyone that should be able to read the docs has been added as a user in
my [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and select
    the Mintlify Auth Handshake.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add users">
    Ensure that any users that should be able to view your documentation have
    been added as users in your [Mintlify dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
  </Step>
</Steps>


# OAuth 2.0 Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/oauth

Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the Authorization Code flow

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the OAuth **Authentication** Handshake. The steps for setting up the [OAuth **Personalization** Handshake](/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/oauth) are slightly different.
</Info>

If you have an existing OAuth server, you can integrate with Mintlify for a seamless login experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication), select the OAuth option, and fill out the required fields:

    * **Authorization URL**: The base URL for the authorization request, to which we will add the appropriate query parameters.
    * **Client ID**: An ID for the OAuth 2.0 client to be used.
    * **Scopes**: An array of scopes that will be requested.
    * **Token URL**: The base URL for the token exchange request.
    * **Info API URL** (optional): The endpoint that will be hit to retrieve user info. If omitted, the OAuth flow will only be used to verify identity, and the user info will be empty.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your OAuth client">
    Copy the Redirect URL listed in the [Mintlify authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add it as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your Info API (Optional)">
    If you want to take advantage of authentication's customization features, you'll need to create an endpoint to retrieve info about your users.
    Create an API endpoint that can be accessed with an OAuth access token, and responds with a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format.

    Return to your [Mintlify authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add the Info API URL
    to your OAuth configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I have an existing OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code flow. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create an endpoint `api.foo.com/docs/user-info` which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope, and responds with the user's custom data according to Mintlify’s specification.

I then go to the dashboard settings, navigate to the Authentication settings, select OAuth, and enter the relevant values for the OAuth flow and Info API endpoint:

* **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
* **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
* **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
* **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
* **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

Finally, I copy the Redirect URL displayed in the dashboard settings and add it as an authorized redirect URL in my OAuth client configuration settings.


# Password Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/password

Use a set of shared passwords to authenticate users

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Password **Authentication** Handshake. The
  Password Handshake is not available for Personalization.
</Info>

If you don't have strict security requirements, or you don't want to manage a
database of documentation readers, you can use a set of shared passwords to
protect your docs.

<Note>
  Authentication is available only by request. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a> for access.
  After we've enabled access, you can follow the implementation instructions.
</Note>

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a password">
    Go to your [dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and create
    a password.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share your password">
    Securely share the password with your documentation readers. That's it!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I don't want
to have to keep track of who can and cannot access the docs. My main use case for
authentication is to prevent competitors from snooping - password sharing is secure
enough for my team.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and add at
least one password. I then share that password, along with the private docs URL,
with potential customers.


# Auth vs Personalization
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-vs-personalization

How to determine which product is best for you

Mintlify offers both Authentication and Personalization. For the most part, Authentication is
just Personalization + privacy. However, there are some key differences that are important to
be aware of, from most important to least:

### Security Guarantees

Authentication is a fully-fledged private documentation solution. Every aspect of your docs,
including page content, images, search results, and AI chat features, are completely inaccessible to
unauthenticated users.

Personalization, on the other hand, offers no security guarantees for your documentation content.
All page content, images, search results, and AI chat features can be accessed by the public. Even
if you are using the hidden pages feature of Personalization, a motivated attacker would still
be able to access the content of a hidden page.

### Handshake Methods

Due to the difference in security requirements for Authentication and Personalization, different
handshake methods are available for each. Both methods offer a JWT and OAuth Handshake, although
the setup steps are slightly different.

Authentication offers two additional Handshake methods:

* **Password Handshake**, which protects your website with a single configurable global password.

* **Mintlify Auth Handshake**, which will allow users to view your documentation only if they have
  access to your dashboard.

Personalization offers one additional Handshake method:

* **Shared Session Handshake**, a super simple method which only requires setting up a single endpoint
  that returns data for already-authenticated users.


# Partial Authentication
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/partial-authentication

Authenticate users to view only certain pages

Partial Authentication allows you to authenticate users to view only certain pages.

You can authenticate users through handshake methods such as:

* [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
* [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt)
* [OAuth](./authentication-setup/oauth)
* [Mintlify dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Partial Authentication shares all the same features as [Authentication](./authentication), but with the ability to allow unauthenticated users to view certain pages.

By default, all pages are protected. You can specify which pages should be publicly accessible by adding the `public` property to the page's frontmatter.

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
public: true
---
```


# Personalization
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization

A list of features unlocked with Personalization

Personalization refers to a suite of features that allow you to customize your
documentation experience based on some information about the user. There are
three major features of Personalization:

* **Customize MDX content** with a user's information, such as their name, plan, or title.

* **Prefill API keys** in the API Playground for streamlined use.

* **Selectively show pages** in the navigation based on a user's groups.

## How to Use

### Customizing MDX Content

When writing content, you can use the `user` variable to access the information you have sent to your docs. Here's a simple example:

Hello, {user.name ?? 'reader'}!

```jsx
Hello, {user.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

This feature becomes even more powerful when paired with custom data about the user. Here's a real world example that allows us to give specific instructions on how to access the Personalization feature based on the customer's existing plan:

Personalization is an enterprise feature. {
  user.org === undefined
  ? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
  : user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
  ? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. To speak to our team about upgrading, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a>.</>
  : <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our team</a>.</>
}

```jsx
Personalization is an enterprise feature. {
  user.org === undefined
    ? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
    : user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
      ? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. To speak to our team about upgrading, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a>.</>
      : <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our team</a>.</>
}
```

<Note>
  The information in `user` is only available after a user has logged in. For
  logged out users, the value of `user` will be `{}`. To prevent the page from
  crashing for logged-out users, always use optional chaining on your `user`
  fields, e.g. `{user.org?.plan}`
</Note>

### Prefilling API Keys

If you return API Playground inputs in the user info, they will automatically be prefilled in the API Playground. Make sure the name of the field in the user info is an exact match of the name in the API Playground.

### Showing/Hiding Pages

By default, every page is visible to every user. If you want to restrict which pages are visible to your users, you can add a `groups` field in your page metadata.
When determining which pages to show to the user, Mintlify will check which groups the user belongs to.
If the user is not in any of the groups listed in the page metadata, the page will not be shown.

```md
---
title: "Managing Your Users"
description: "Adding and removing users from your organization"
groups: ["admin"]
---
```

Here's a table that displays whether a page is shown for different combinations of `groups` in User and page metadata:

|                                 | `groups` not in User | `groups: []` in User | `groups: ['admin']` in User |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| `groups` not in metadata        |           ✅          |           ✅          |              ✅              |
| `groups: []` in metadata        |           ❌          |           ❌          |              ❌              |
| `groups: ['admin']` in metadata |           ❌          |           ❌          |              ✅              |

<Note>
  Note that an empty array in the page metadata is interpreted as "No groups
  should see this page."
</Note>


# Choosing a Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/choosing-a-handshake

How to decide which Handshake method is right for your docs

<Info>
  This is the documentation for **Personalization** Handshake methods. Authentication offers a [different set of Handshake methods](/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/choosing-a-handshake).
</Info>

Before your users can access personalized content, they must be authenticated. Mintlify supports three Personalization Handshake methods:

1. **Shared Session**: Utilize the same session token used by your dashboard to authenticate users.
2. **JWT**: Use your own login flow to send user info to your docs via a JWT in the URL.
3. **OAuth 2.0**: Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the PKCE flow.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shared Session">
    * You have a dashboard or other user portal hosted at your domain.
    * Your users' session credentials are stored as cookies.
    * You can create a new API endpoint at the same origin or a subdomain of your dashboard.
      * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`
      * If your dashboard is at `dash.foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `dash.foo.com` or `*.dash.foo.com`
    * Your docs are hosted at the same domain as your dashboard.
      * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`
      * If your dashboard is at `*.foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT">
    * You have some existing login flow.
    * You can add a final step in this login flow that creates a JWT and redirects to the docs.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    * You have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow.
    * You can create a new API endpoint that can be accessed by the returned OAuth access token.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pros & Cons

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shared Session">
    Pros:

    * Users that are logged into your dashboard are automatically logged into your docs
    * Your users' sessions are persistent, meaning you can refresh data without requiring additional login
    * Minimal setup required

    Cons:

    * Your docs will make a request to your backend, which may be undesirable
    * You must have a dashboard that uses session authentication
    * CORS configuration is usually required
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT">
    Pros:

    * Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse
    * Zero CORS configuration
    * No restrictions on API URLs

    Cons:

    * Must be able to hook into your existing login flow
    * Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are completely decoupled, so users will need to log in to your dashboard and your docs separately
    * Every time you want to refresh user data, your users must re-login to your docs
      * If your users' data changes frequently, you must require your users to log in frequently or risk having stale data in the docs
      * If your users' data rarely changes, this shouldn't be a problem
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    Pros:

    * Heightened security standard
    * No restrictions on API URLs

    Cons:

    * Requires significant work if setting up OAuth server for the first time
    * Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are completely decoupled, so users will need to log in to your dashboard and your docs separately
    * Might be overkill for some applications
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


# JWT Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/jwt

Use a customized login flow to authenticate users

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the JWT **Personalization** Handshake. The steps for setting up the [JWT **Authentication** Handshake](/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/jwt) are slightly different.
</Info>

If you don’t have a dashboard, or if you want to keep your dashboard and docs completely separate, you can use your own login flow to send user info to your docs via a JWT in the URL.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key">
    Go to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and generate a private key. Store this key somewhere secure where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a login flow">
    Create a login flow that does the following:

    * Authenticate the user
    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the [User](../sending-data) format
    * Sign the JWT with the secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm
    * Create a redirect URL back to your docs, including the JWT as the hash
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Return to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add the login URL to your Personalization settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs
to be completely separate from my dashboard (or I don’t have a dashboard at all).

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and generate a
JWT secret. I create a web URL `https://foo.com/docs-login` that initiates a login flow
for my users. At the end of this login flow, once I have verified the identity of the user,
I create a JWT containing the user’s custom data according to Mintlify’s specification.
I use a JWT library to sign this JWT with my Mintlify secret, create a redirect URL of the
form `https://docs.foo.com#{SIGNED_JWT}`, and redirect the user.

I then go to the dashboard settings and enter `https://foo.com/docs-login` for the
Login URL field.

Here's what the code might look like:

```ts
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000),
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s')
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com#${jwt}`);
}

```

## Preserving Anchors

Post-login, if you'd like to redirect to a specific anchor on the page, you can use the following format to create the redirect URL: `https://docs.foo.com/page#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor={ANCHOR}`.

Example:

* Original: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#step-one`
* Redirect: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor=step-one`


# OAuth 2.0 Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/oauth

Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the PKCE flow

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the OAuth **Personalization** Handshake. The steps for setting up the [OAuth **Authentication** Handshake](/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/oauth) are slightly different.
</Info>

If you have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow, you can integrate with Mintlify for a seamless login experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that can be accessed with an OAuth access token, and responds with a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format. Take note of the scope or scopes required to access this endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Go to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication), select the OAuth option, and fill out the required fields:

    * **Authorization URL**: The base URL for the authorization request, to which we will add the appropriate query parameters.
    * **Client ID**: An ID for the OAuth 2.0 client to be used.
    * **Scopes**: An array of scopes that will be requested.
    * **Token URL**: The base URL for the token exchange request.
    * **Info API URL**: The endpoint that will be hit to retrieve user info.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your OAuth client">
    Copy the Redirect URL listed in the [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add it as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create an endpoint `api.foo.com/docs/user-info` which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope, and responds with the user's custom data according to Mintlify’s specification.

I then go to the dashboard settings, navigate to the Personalization settings, select OAuth, and enter the relevant values for the OAuth flow and Info API endpoint:

* **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
* **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
* **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
* **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
* **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

Finally, I copy the Redirect URL displayed in the dashboard settings and add it as an authorized redirect URL in my OAuth client configuration settings.


# Shared Session Handshake
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/shared-session

Seamlessly share user sessions between your dashboard and your docs

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Shared Session **Personalization** Handshake. The Shared Session Handshake is not available for Authentication.
</Info>

This method utilizes the session authentication info already stored in your user’s browser to create a seamless documentation experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that uses session authentication to identify users, and responds with a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format.

    If the API domain does not *exactly match* the docs domain:

    * Add the docs domain to your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (must not be `*`)
    * Ensure your API’s `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header is `true`

    <Warning>
      These CORS options only need to be enabled on the *single endpoint* responsible for returning user information. We do not recommend enabling these options on all dashboard endpoints.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Go to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add the API URL and your Login URL to your Personalization settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at subdomain

I have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. My dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create another dashboard endpoint `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` which identifies the user using session auth, and responds with their custom data according to Mintlify’s specification. I then add `https://docs.foo.com` to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allow-list **for this route only**, and ensure my `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` configuration is set to `true` **for this route only**.

I then go to the dashboard settings and enter `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` for the API URL field.

### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at root

I have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. My dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create another dashboard endpoint `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` which identifies the user using session auth, and responds with their custom data according to Mintlify’s specification. I then add `https://foo.com` to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allow-list **for this route only**, and ensure my `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` configuration is set to `true` **for this route only**.

I then go to the dashboard settings and enter `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` for the API URL field.

### Dashboard at root, docs at root

I have a dashboard at `foo.com/dashboard`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. My dashboard API routes are hosted at `foo.com/api`. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create another dashboard endpoint `foo.com/api/docs/user-info` which identifies the user using session auth, and responds with their custom data according to Mintlify’s specification.

I then go to the dashboard settings and enter `https://foo.com/api/docs/user-info` for the API URL field.


# Sending Data
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/authentication-personalization/sending-data

The shape of user data you can use to personalize your docs

Depending on your Handshake method, your API will respond with either a raw JSON object or a signed JWT. The shape of the data is the same for both:

```tsx
type User = {
  expiresAt?: number;
  groups?: string[];
  content?: Record<string, any>;
  apiPlaygroundInputs?: {
    header?: Record<string, any>;
    query?: Record<string, any>;
    cookie?: Record<string, any>;
    server?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

<ParamField path="expiresAt" type="number">
  The time at which this information should expire, in **seconds since epoch**. If the user loads the page and the current time is after this value, the stored data will be deleted.
  <Warning><b>For JWT Handshakes:</b> This is *not* the same as the `exp` claim of the JWT. The `exp` claim determines when a JWT should no longer be considered valid, and should be set as low as possible. In this case, it can probably be set to 10 seconds or lower. The `expiresAt` field determines when retrieved data should be considered stale, and can be anywhere from one day to several weeks.</Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="groups" type="string[]">
  A list of groups that the user belongs to. This will determine which pages should be shown to this user. If any of these groups is listed in the `groups` field of a page’s metadata, that page will be shown.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="content" type="object">
  A bag of values that can be accessed from within MDX content using the `user` variable. For example, if you have supplied `{ firstName: 'Ronan' }` as your content field, you can use the following in your MDX: `Good morning, {user.firstName}!`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="apiPlaygroundInputs" type="object">
  User-specific values that will be prefilled in the API playground if supplied. For example, if each of my customers makes requests at a specific subdomain, I can send `{ server: { subdomain: 'foo' } }` as my `apiPlaygroundInputs` field, and this value will be prefilled on any API page with this `subdomain` value.

  <Note>The`header`, `query`, and `cookie` fields will only be prefilled if they are part of your [security scheme](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/). Creating a standard header parameter named `Authorization` is not sufficient to enable this feature. To know if a field will be prefilled, navigate to your existing docs and check if the field is in either the `Authorization` or `Server` section.</Note>
</ParamField>


# Redirects and Broken Links
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/broken-links

Tools to help prevent invalid links

When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it will also change the path of the URL to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

## Broken Links

Catch broken links with our CLI. Simply [install the CLI](/development) and run the command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

The CLI will identify any relative links in your docs that don't exist.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field into your `docs.json` file.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This will permanently redirect `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` will match `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```


# CI Checks
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/ci

Add broken links, linting, and grammar checks to the updating process

<Warning>
  This feature is only available for customers on paid plans and for GitHub. Support for other platforms is coming soon.
</Warning>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors, and give you warnings before you deploy.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to have followed the steps on the [GitHub](/settings/github) page.

For GitHub Apps, you can choose to only give permissions to a single repository.
We highly recommend you do so as we only need access to the repository where
your docs are hosted.

## Configuration

You can configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment on the Mintlify dashboard by navigating to the 'Add-Ons' tab. There you can enable or disable the checks you'd like to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

<Note>
  A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if not passed, or changes are suggested.<br />

  A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.
</Note>

## When Do They Run?

CI checks are configured to run on commits to your configured deployment branch, or on pull requests against that branch.

## Available CI Checks

### Broken Links

Similarly to how the [CLI link checker](/settings/broken-links#broken-links) works on your local machine, we will automatically check your docs for broken links.
To see the results of this check, you can visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check, and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration

If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root the content directory for your deployment, we will automatically use that configuration file.
We will also automatically use any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

<Tip>Don't have a Vale config or not sure where to get started? Don't worry, Mintlify has a default configuration that will automatically be used if one is not provided.</Tip>

<Warning>
  Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support any absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values. Please use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Warning>

#### Packages

Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors.
Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` will be automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they will automatically be downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Warning>
  Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support automatically downloading packages that are not from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer).
</Warning>

#### Vale with MDX

Vale does not natively support MDX, but Vale's author has provided a [custom extension](https://github.com/errata-ai/MDX) to support it.

If you'd prefer not to use this extension, we recommend the following lines in your `.vale.ini` file:

```ini
[formats]
mdx = md

[*.mdx]
CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}

TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
```

To use Vale's in-document comments, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`.
If you use the `CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}` [setting](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/commentdelimiters) in your configuration, Vale will automatically interpret these comments while linting.
This means you can easily use Vale's in-built features, like skipping lines or sections.

```mdx
{/* vale off */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```

If you choose not to use `CommentDelimiters`, but still choose to use Vale's comments, you must wrap any Vale comments in MDX comments `{/* ... */}`. For example:

```mdx
{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}
```

Please note that these commment tags are not supported within Mintlify components, but can be used anywhere at the base level of a document.


# Custom Domain
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/custom-domain

Host your documentation at your website's custom domain

To set up your documentation on a custom domain, you'll need to set your desired custom domain in your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory like mintlify.com/docs? Find
  instructions [here](/advanced/subpath/cloudflare).
</Info>

## Dashboard Settings

1. Head over to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Click on "Settings".
3. Click on "Custom Domain".
4. Enter your desired custom domain. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Custom Domain" className="block dark:hidden" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/add-custom-domain-light.png" />

  <img alt="Custom Domain" className="hidden dark:block" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png" />
</Frame>

## Verification with Vercel

If Vercel happens to be your domain provider, you will have to add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom domain, as well as be emailed to you.

## Configuring your DNS

1. Proceed to your domain's DNS settings on your domain provider's website.
2. Create a new DNS entry, inputting the following values:

```
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com.
```

<Frame>
  <img alt="DNS" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

If you are using Cloudflare for your DNS provider, you'll need to have the “full strict” security option enabled for the https setting.

Please [contact support](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) if you don't see the custom domain set up after the above configuration.


# Custom CSS & JS
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/custom-scripts

Fully customize your documentation with custom CSS & JS

Add custom CSS & JS to your documentation to fully customize the look and feel.

## Custom CSS

Add any number of CSS files to your repository and the defined class names will be applied and available across all of your MDX files.

### Adding style.css

For example, you can add the following `style.css` file to customize the styling of the navbar and footer.

```css
#navbar {
  background: "#fffff2";
  padding: 1rem;
}

footer {
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
```

### Using Identifiers

Mintlify has a set of common identifiers to help you tag important elements of the UI. Some, but not all are listed in the following:

`#topbar-cta-button` `#navbar` `#sidebar` `#content-area` `#table-of-contents`

<Tip>
  Use inspect element to find references to elements you're looking to
  customize.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  References and the styling of common elements are subject to change as the
  platform evolves. Please use custom styling with caution.
</Warning>

## Custom JS

Custom JS allows you to add custom executable code globally. It is the equivalent of adding a `<script>` tag with JS code into every page.

### Adding Custom JavaScript

Any `.js` file inside the content directory of your docs will be included in every documentation page. For example, you can add the following `ga.js` file to enable [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics) across the entire documentation.

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
  dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag('js', new Date());

gtag('config', 'TAG_ID');
```

<Warning>
  Please use with caution to not introduce security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>


# GitHub
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/github

Sync your docs with a GitHub repo

Mintlify integrates with the GitHub API, enabling synchronization between your
docs and your GitHub repository. This integration is made possible through the
utilization of
[GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps).

## Installation

To begin, you need to install the Mintlify GitHub App into the GitHub account
where your docs repo resides. Installing a GitHub App requires either
organization ownership or admin permissions in a repository. If you lack the
necessary permissions, the repository owner will need to approve the request.
You can access the installation page by logging into the
[Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

For GitHub Apps, you can choose to only give permissions to a single repository.
We highly recommend you do so as we only need access to the repository where
your docs are hosted.

<Frame>
  <img className="h-80" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/github/select-repos.png" />
</Frame>

## Permissions

During the installation of our GitHub app, you will be prompted to grant certain
permissions:

* Read and write access to `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `pull requests`,
  and `workflows`

These permissions are leveraged to provide a seamless experience when managing
your docs.

When you make a commit to the branch you configured as your docs deployment
branch, we fetch the contents of the files changed to update your docs. To
accomplish this we need read access to your `contents`.

When pull requests are created we create a check and preview deployment which is
why we need write access to `checks` and `deployments`.

Inside the Mintlify web editor, Mintlify works on your behalf to create branches
and pull requests which is why we need write access to `pull requests` and
`workflows`.

<Info>
  If you are concerned about the write permissions, the GitHub App will only
  have access to the repos you give it access to *and* if you have branch
  protections on it *cannot* push directly to your branches - it abides by your
  branch protection rules.
</Info>

## Repositories Installations

# GitLab
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/gitlab

Sync your docs with a GitLab repo

We use a combination of Access tokens and Webhooks to authenticate and sync
changes between GitLab and Mintlify.

* We use Access tokens to pull information from GitLab.
* We use Webhooks so GitLab can notify Mintlify when changes are made.
  * This allows Mintlify to create preview deployments when a MR is created.

## Set up the connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your project ID">
    Within your GitLab project, navigate to `Settings` > `General` and find the `Project ID`.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-id.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate an access token">
    a. Navigate to `Settings` > `Access Tokens`.

    b. Select `Add new token`.

    1. Name the token "Mintlify".
    2. If you have a private repo, you must set the role as `Maintainer`.
    3. Choose `api` and `read_api` for the scopes.

    c. Finally click `Create project access token` and copy the token.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up the connection">
    Within the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings), add the project ID and access token from the previous steps alongside the other configurations. Click "Save Changes" when you're done.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create the webhook

Webhooks allow us to receive events when changes are made so that we can
automatically trigger deployments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings > Webhooks and click 'Add new Webhook'">
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/gitlab/gitlab-webhook.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up URL and webhook">
    In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint `https://leaves.mintlify.com/gitlab-webhook` and name the webhook "Mintlify".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste token">
    Paste the Webhook token generated after setting up the connection.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/gitlab/gitlab-show-webtoken.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select events">
    Select the events you want to trigger the webhook:

    * Push events (All branches)
    * Merge requests events

    When you're done it should look like this:

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-webtoken.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Webhook">
    After creating the Webhook, click the "Test" dropdown and select "Push events" to send a sample payload to ensure it's configured correctly. It'll say "Hook executed successfully: HTTP 200" if configured correctly.

    This will help you verify that everything is working correctly and that your documentation will sync properly with your GitLab repository.

# Global Settings
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/global

Configure your documentation using the `docs.json` file

Every documentation site requires a `docs.json` file that contains the core configuration settings. This file controls everything from styling and navigation to integrations and analytics.

<Note>
  If you're currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the CLI:

  ```sh
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  And run the new `upgrade` command in your docs repository:

  ```sh
  mintlify upgrade
  ```

  This will generate a `docs.json` based off of your `mint.json`. Then, please delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
</Note>

## Best Practices

When configuring your `docs.json` file, consider these best practices:

1. Keep the configuration organized by grouping related settings together
2. Use meaningful names for groups and pages in your navigation structure
3. Provide complete paths for all assets (logos, favicons, etc.)
4. Test your configuration in both light and dark modes
5. Verify all external links and integrations are correctly configured
6. Use appropriate color contrasts for accessibility
7. Configure SEO settings for better search engine visibility

## Validation

The `docs.json` file is validated against a JSON schema to ensure proper configuration. You can reference the schema by including:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://mintlify.com/docs.json"
}
```

## `mint.json` (Legacy)

<Accordion title="Documentation for the legacy `mint.json` config file">
  Every Mintlify site needs a `mint.json` file with the core configuration
  settings. Learn more about the [properties](#properties) or from an
  [example](#example-mint-json)

    such as 'Was this page helpful?', will automatically be translated based on the
    locale. We currently support localization in English, Chinese, Spanish, French,
    Japanese, and Portuguese.

    <Info>
      Localization auto-translates the UI and fixed assets in the docs, such as "Was
      this page helpful?". You must translate the content of the pages yourself.

# Preview Deployments
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/preview-deployments

Preview changes to your docs in a live deployment

<Info>
  Preview Deployments are available on the Growth and Enterprise plans. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for more information.
</Info>

Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your docs in a live deployment without merging those changes to your production branch.

If you have created a pull or merge request when using Git, the generated preview URL will be available as a comment from the Mintlify bot in the PR. This URL will always reflect the latest deployment changes.

## Sharing Preview Deployments

After generating a preview URL, you can share that link with anybody for them to view.

### Authenticated Preview Deployments

If you'd like to restrict access to your Preview Deployments, you can set up preview deployment authentication. When using this authentication method, only Mintlify authenticated users will be able to access your Preview Deployments.

To set up preview deployment authentication, please [contact sales](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).


# SEO
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/seo

Mintlify automatically generates most meta tags. If you want to customize them, you can set default values in docs.json or change them per page.

<Accordion title="Supported Meta Tags">
  * og:site\_name
  * og:title
  * og:description
  * og:url
  * og:image
  * og:locale
  * og:logo
  * article:publisher
  * twitter:title
  * twitter:description
  * twitter:url
  * twitter:image
  * twitter:site
  * og:image:width
  * og:image:height
  * robots
</Accordion>

## Default meta tags

You can set default meta tags by adding the `metadata` field to your `docs.json`.

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "og:image": "link to your default meta tag image"
    }
}
```

## Changing meta tags on one page

Add your meta tags to the page's metadata like so:

```md
---
title: 'Your Example Page Title'
'og:image': 'link to your meta tag image'
---
```

<Warning>
  Meta tags with colons need to be typed with quotes around them when you put them in the page metadata.
</Warning>

## Sitemaps

Mintlify automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file and a `robots.txt` file. Simply add `/sitemap.xml` to the end of your website URL to see your sitemap. We recommend submitting the sitemap to search engines for improved SEO.

Only pages included in your `docs.json` are included by default. To include hidden links, add `seo.indexing` to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexing": all
}
```

## Disabling indexing

If you want to stop a page from being indexed by search engines, you can include the following in the [frontmatter](/page) of your page:

```
---
noindex: true
---
```

You can also specify `noindex` for all pages in your docs by setting the `metadata.robots` field to `"noindex"` in your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
      "robots": "noindex"
    }
  }
```


# Headers and Text
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/text

Text, title, and styling in standard markdown

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>
  Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.
</Tip>

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**          |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | *italic*          |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get ***bold and italic*** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

You can validate broken links in your docs with [our CLI](/development).

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports in-line [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) by surrounding your LaTeX code with dollar signs (\$). For example, `$(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$` will render as $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$.

Equations on their own line can be created with double dollar signs (\$\$):

$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$

```md
$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$
```

### Line Breaks

Markdown syntax also recognizes a double enter in your MDX as a linebreak.

```html
<br />
```

```md
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```


# Themes
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/themes

Customize the appearance of your documentation

export const ThemeCard = ({title, description, image, href}) => {
  return <div className="flex mt-4 gap-12 group">
      <div className="flex-1">
        <h4 className="mt-0">{title}</h4>
        <div class="prose-sm prose-gray mb-4">{description}</div>
        <a href={href} className="not-prose text-sm font-medium text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-300">
          See preview
        </a>
      </div>
      <div className="flex-1">
        <a href={href}>
          <img className="mt-0 rounded-xl" src={image} alt={title} style={{
    pointerEvents: 'none'
  }} />
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>;
};

We offer pre-built themes so you can differentiate the look and feel of your documentation based on your brand.

## Configuration

You can configure the theme in the `docs.json` file.

For example, to use the `maple` theme, you can add the following to your `docs.json` file:

```json
{
  "theme": "maple"
}
```

## Available Themes

There are a variety of themes to choose from.

<br />

<ThemeCard title="Mint" description="Classic documentation theme with time-tested layouts and familiar navigation." image="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/themes/mint.png" href="https://mint.mintlify.app" />

# Web Editor
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor

Edit your docs directly from the dashboard with live previews.

Web Editor is the preferred way to edit docs directly without having to open your IDE or run `mintlify dev`.

The editor includes a few key features to integrate directly into your existing git workflow,
like creating branches, pull requests, commits, and diffs for your current changes.

It also includes a fully editable experience for changing and adding content directly,
even with custom components.

If you understand git workflows and our integrations already, you can skip to [here](#editing-content).

## Git and update workflows

### Git basics

While Web Editor means you don't need to go to GitHub or your command line to make
changes, it's still helpful to know the basics of git.

Git terminology:

* **Repository**: The folder in which your code lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (like GitHub).

* **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.

* **Branch**: A separate line of development. It's a working copy of the code that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main version.

* **Pull request:** A request to merge changes from a working branch into the main branch. This is used for reviewing content before making changes live.

### Making updates

In order to make updates to your docs, we include a few buttons specifically to
integrate with your git workflow.

<Note>
  If you haven't done so already, please install the Mintlify GitHub app to your GitHub account.
  You can find [documentation here](#1-deploying-your-docs-repository), or you can install
  the app in the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app)
  page of the dashboard.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating new branches">
    In order to make changes to your docs, you might want to change from the main branch
    to avoid publishing directly to your main docs site.

    To do this, you can open the branches modal on the top left of the editor.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/branches-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/branches-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    From here, you can either switch to a different git branch than `main`, or you can
    create a new branch by clicking the **"New Branch"** button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/new-branch-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/new-branch-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    After you create a new branch, you'll automatically be switched, and all changes
    you make will be made to this new branch until you change branches again or reload the page.

    By default, when you load the page again, you'll default to the main branch.

    <Tip>
      As a best practice, you should always create a new branch to make changes so you can submit a pull request for review by other teammates. You also may not have permissions to make changes to the main branch, in which case we'll try to open a pull request for you.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making a commit">
    In order to make a commit, you have two options, both of which appear on the top
    right of the editor:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Main branch">
        If you're on the main branch of your docs repository, you can push a commit
        directly to the repo by clicking the **"Publish"** button. You'll see your changes
        reflect in your git branch the next time you run `git pull`.

        <Frame>
          <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/publish-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

          <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/publish-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Different branch">
        If you're not on the main branch, you can push a commit to your branch by clicking
        on the **"Save Changes"** button. If you're ready to publish a pull request to put your branch
        up for review, you can click the **"Publish Pull Request"** button.

## Editing content

### Slash commands

The easiest way to add content in the editor is by using **"Slash commands"**, which are
commands you have access to after typing `/` in the **"Visual Editor"** mode:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/slash-commands-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/slash-commands-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

As you type, you'll see more options pop up:

</Frame>

#### Content blocks

Here are the types of content blocks available to add in the **"Visual Editor"**:

<AccordionGroup>

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card icon="paragraph" href="/text#text-formatting" horizontal>Paragraph</Card>

### Adding images

You can add images to your page by typing `/image` and either clicking on the **"Image"**
option or hitting <kbd>↓</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the **"Image"** option.

This will open up the image modal where you have the option to either upload a new
image or use an existing image from the repo.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/images-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/images-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Uploading an image can be done through the modal:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/upload-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/upload-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

And you can preview an existing image before you add it.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/image-preview-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/image-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Editing images

In order to edit images, you just have to hover over the image to see the **"Delete"**
and **"Edit"** buttons on the top right of the image.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/edit-image-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/edit-image-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Clicking the **"Edit"** button lets you edit the attributes of the image.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/image-form-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/image-form-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

If you want to update the source of an image to be a new image that you haven't yet
uploaded, you have to first delete the image you're changing, and then add a new one
using the [instructions above](#adding-images).

## Editor modes

In order to offer the most flexibility, the editor has three modes:

<Frame caption="View mode toggle">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/mode-toggle-light.png" />

  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" />
</Frame>

### Visual Editor

The **"Visual Editor"** is the typical WYSIWYG mode you'd see in something like Notion.
It offers you a view into your docs in a fully editable way that reflects what the final
page would look like on your main docs site.

### Source Editor

The **"Source Editor"** offers you a way to edit your MDX files in code, the same way
you'd do in your IDE. This offers less flexibility, in that our components aren't available
for auto-complete, but it does have two unique advantages.

1. It allows you to edit props of components (see our [limitations below](#current-limitations))
   which is currently not available in **"Visual Editor"** mode yet.

2. It allows you to correct syntax errors which might've appeared in your repo that
   might not be compatible with **"Visual Editor"** mode until you've fixed them.

### Diff View

The **"Diff View"** is a way to view the changes made to a specific document before
committing it to your repository.

This will help you see changes you've made along with formatting changes made by
the editor.

## Current limitations

We do have a few current limitations in the editor that we're working to resolve.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WYSIWYG navigation tree">
    You currently cannot live-update your navigation based on added/edited files. You
    still have to manually edit renamed, added, and deleted files in your `docs.json`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Snippet previews">
    We currently don't show any previews for custom snippets. This is on our roadmap to support
    as fully editable components.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAPI previews">
    We currently don't show any previews for OpenAPI specs. This is on our roadmap to support
    as a read-only preview.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
