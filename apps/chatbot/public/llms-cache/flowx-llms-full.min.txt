# Node actions
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/actions
The activity that a node has to handle is defined using an action. These can have various types, they can be used to specify the communication details for plugins or integrations.
<Card title="Why it is important?" />
Node actions allow you to incorporate <Tooltip tip="Business rules are actions that can be configured on task/user task nodes in a business process. Business rules can be written in various script languages such as MVEL, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, or DMN (Decision Model and Notation)."> **business rules** </Tooltip> into a <Tooltip tip="A process is a representation of a business use case, such as requesting a new credit card. These steps can involve a combination of automated actions and human interactions."> **process**</Tooltip>, and send various data to be displayed in front-end applications.
The Flowx.AI platform supports the following **types of node actions**:

</CardGroup>
<Info>
You can only define and add actions on the following types of **nodes**: [**send message task**](../node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task), [**task**](../node/task-node) and [**user task**](../node/user-task-node).
</Info>
Actions fall into two categories:
* Business rules
* User interactions
### Business rules
Actions can use action rules such as DMN rules, MVEL expressions, or scripts in JavaScript, Python, or Groovy to attach business rules to a node.

</Card>
<Hint>
Each button on the user interface corresponds to a manual user action.
</Hint>
### Action edit
Actions can be:
* Manual or automatic
* Optional or mandatory
<Info>
If all the mandatory actions are not executed on a node, the flow (token) will not advance.
</Info>
* Actions can also be marked as one-time or repeatable

### Action parameters
Action params store extra values as key/value pairs, like topics for outgoing messages or message formats for the front-end.
<Info>
A decision on an **exclusive gateway** is defined using a **node rule**. Similar to action rules, these can be set using [DMN](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-dmn) or [MVEL](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel).
</Info>
## Configuring actions
Actions have a few characteristics that need to be set:
* an **action** can be set as **manual** or **automatic**. Manual actions can be executed only through the REST API, this usually means they are triggered by the application user from the interface. Automatic actions are executed without any need for external triggers.
* manual actions can be either mandatory or optional. Automatic actions are all considered mandatory.
* all actions have an **order.** When there are more actions on a single node, the order needs to be set.
* **repeatable** - the actions that could be triggered more than once are marked accordingly
* the actions can have a parent/child hierarchy
* **allow back to this action** - the user can navigate back to this action from a subsequent node
For more information, check the following section:
<Card title="Adding an action to a node" href="../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node" />
## Linking actions together
There are two ways actions could be linked together, so certain actions can be set to run immediately after others.
<Info>
Certain actions can run immediately after another action by setting the `parentName` field on the action for callbacks. Callback actions are performed when a specific message is received by the Engine, indicated by the `callbacksForAction` header in the message. To run actions immediately after the parent action, set the `autoRunChildren` flag to true for the parent action.
</Info>
### Child actions
A parent action has a flag `autoRunChildren`, set to `false` by default. When this flag is set to `true`, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will be run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/autorun_children.png)
</Frame>
### Callback actions
Child actions can be marked as callbacks to be run after a reply from an external system is received. They will need to be set when defining the interaction with the external system (the [Kafka send action](../node/message-send-received-task-node#configuring-a-message-send-task-node)).
For example, a callback function might be used to handle a user's interaction with a web page, such as upload a file. When the user performs the action, the callback function is executed, allowing the web application to respond appropriately.

Child actions can be marked as callbacks to be run after a reply from an external system is received. They will need to be set when defining the interaction with the external system (the Kafka send action).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/callback2.png)
</Frame>
#### Example
Callback actions are added in the **Advanced configuration** tab, in the **header** param - `callbacksForAction`.
```js
{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}, "destinationId": "upload_file", "callbacksForAction": "upload_file"}
```
* `callbacksForAction` - the value of this key is a string that specifies a callback action associated with the "upload\_file" destination ID. This is part of an event-driven system (Kafka send action) where this callback will be called once the "upload\_file" action is completed.
## Scheduling actions
A useful feature for actions is having the ability to set them to run at a future time. Actions can be configured to be run after a period of time, starting from the moment the token triggered them to be executed.

# Append params to parent process
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/append-params-to-parent-process
It is a type of action that allows you to send data from a subprocess to a parent process.
**Why is it important?**  If you are using subprocesses that produce data that needs to be sent back to the main **process**, you can do that by using an **Append Params to Parent Process** action.
## Configuring an Append params to parent process
After you create a process designed to be used as a [subprocess](../process/subprocess), you can configure the action. To do this, you need to add an **Append Params to Parent Process** on a [**Task node**](../node/task-node) in the subprocess.
The following properties must be configured:
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Back in steps (for Manual actions)](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Data to send (for Manual actions)](#data-to-send)
### Action edit
* **Name** - used internally to make a distinction between different actions on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to be able to quickly find the process actions
* **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, the running order should be set using this option
* **Timer expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format ](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)(for example, a delay of 30 seconds will be set up as `PT30S`)
* **Action type** - should be set to **Append Params to Parent Process**
* **Trigger type** (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); in most use cases, this will be set to automatic
* **Required type** (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times;
* **Autorun Children** - when this is switched on, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized
### Back in steps
* **Allow BACK on this action** - back in process is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process and redo a series of previous actions in the process. For more details, check [**Moving a token backwards in a process**](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) section
### Parameters
* **Copy from current state** - data that you want to be copied back to the parent process
* **Destination in the parent state** - on what key to copy the param values
<Check>
To recap: if you have a **Copy from current state** with a simple **JSON** -`{"age": 17}`, that needs to be available in the parent process, on the `application.client.age` key, you will need to set this field (**Destination in the parent state**) with `application.client`, which will be the key to append to in the parent process.
</Check>
**Advanced configuration**
* **Show Target Process** - ID of the parent process where you need to copy the params, this was made available on to the `${parentProcessInstanceId}` variable, if you defined it when you [started the subprocess](./start-subprocess-action)
### Data to send
* **Keys** - are used when data is sent from the frontend via an action to validate the data (you can find more information in the [User Task configuration](../node/user-task-node) section)
<Warning>
**Data to send** option is configurable only when the action **trigger type** is **Manual.**
</Warning>
## Example
We have a subprocess that allows us to enter the age of the client on the **data.client.age** key, and we want to copy the value back to the parent process. The key to which we want to receive this value in the parent process is **application.client.age**.
This is the configuration to apply the above scenario:
**Parameters**
* **Copy from current state** - `{"client": ${data.client.age}}` to copy the age of the client (the param value we want to copy)
* **Destination in the parent state** - `application` to append the data o to the **application** key on the parent process
**Advanced configuration**
* **Show Target Process** - `${parentProcessInstanceId}`to copy the data on the parent of this subprocess

# Business rules types
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action
A business rule is an action type in FlowX that allows you to configure a script on a BPMN node. It's a way to specify business logic or decision-making processes in a business process.
The script can read and write the data available on the process at the moment the script is executed. For this reason, it is very important to understand what data is available on the process when the script is executed.
Business rules can be attached to a node by using actions with [**action rules**](../actions#action-rules) on them. These can be specified using [DMN rules](./dmn-business-rule-action), [MVEL](../../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel) expressions, or scripts written in JavaScript, Python, or Groovy.
![Business rule action](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/business_rule_action.png)
For more information about supported scripting languages, see the next section:
<Card title="Supported scripts" href="../../supported-scripts" icon="link" />
You can also test your rules by using the **Test Rule** function.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/test_rule_function.png)
## Configuration
To use a Business Rules Action, follow these steps:
1. **Select a BPMN Task Node**: Choose the BPMN task node to which you want to attach the Business Rules Action. This could be a Service Task, User Task, or another task type that supports actions.
2. **Define the Action**: In the task node properties, configure the "Business Rules Action" field and select the desired language (MVEL, Java, JavaScript or Python).
3. **Write the Business Rule**: In the selected language, write the business rule or decision logic. This rule should take input data, process it, and possibly generate an output or result.
4. **Input and Output Variables**: Ensure that the task node can access the necessary input variables from the BPMN process context and store any output or result variables as needed.
5. **Execution**: When the BPMN process reaches the task node, the attached Business Rules Action is executed, and the defined business rule is evaluated.
6. **Result**: The result of the business rule execution may affect the flow of the BPMN process, update process variables, or trigger other actions based on the logic defined in the rule.
Let's take look at the following example. We have some data about the gender of a user and we need to create a business rule that computes the formal title based on the gender:
1. This is how the process instance data looks like before it reaches the business rule:
```json
{
"application" : {
"client" :
{
"firstName" : "David",
"surName" : "James",
"gender" : "M",
}
}
}
```
2. When the token reaches this node the following script (defined for the business rule) is executed. The language used here for scripting is MVEL.
```java
if (input.application.client.gender == 'F') {
output.put("application", {
"client": {
"salutation": "Ms"
}
});
} else if (input.application.client.gender == 'M') {
output.put("application", {
"client": {
"salutation": "Mr"
}
});
} else {
output.put("application", {
"client": {
"salutation": "Mx"
}
});
}
```
3. After the script is executed, the process instance data will look like this:
```json
{
"application": {
"client": {
"firstName": "David",
"surName": "James",
"gender": "M",
"salutation": "Mr"
}
}
}
```
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/mvel_example.gif)
## Flattened vs unflattened keys
<Warning>
With version [**2.5.0**](https://old-docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v2.5.0-april-2022/) we introduced unflattened keys inside business rules. Flattened keys are now obsolete. You are notified when you need to delete and recreate a business rule so it contains an unflattened key.
</Warning>

# Configuring a DMN business rule action
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/dmn-business-rule-action
Decision Model and Notation is a graphical language used to specify business decisions. DMN helps convert complex decision-making code into easily readable diagrams.
## Creating a DMN Business Rule action
To create and link a DMN <Tooltip tip="Business rules are actions that can be configured on task/user task nodes in a business process. Business rules can be written in various script languages such as MVEL, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, or DMN (Decision Model and Notation).">**business rule** </Tooltip> action to a task **node** in FLOWX, follow these steps:
<Steps>
1. Launch <Tooltip tip="The Designer is the FLOWX.AI no-code visual development environment. It allows users to create web and mobile applications without having to know how to code."> **FlowX Designer** </Tooltip> and navigate to <Tooltip tip="The core of the platform is the process definition, which is the blueprint of the business process made up of nodes that are linked by sequences."> **Process Definitions** </Tooltip>.
2. Locate and select your specific process from the list, then click on **Edit Process**.
3. Choose a **task node**, and click the **Edit** button (represented by a key icon). This action will open the node configuration menu.
4. Inside the node configuration menu, head to the **Actions** tab and click the "**+**" button to add a new action.
5. From the dropdown menu, select the action type as **Business Rule**.
6. In the **Language** dropdown menu, pick **DMN**.
</Steps>
For a visual guide, refer to the following recording:
![Creating a DMN Business Rule Action](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/create_dmn_business_rule_action.gif)
## Using a DMN Business Rule Action
Consider a scenario where a bank needs to perform client information tasks/actions to send salutations, similar to what was previously created using MVEL [here](./business-rule-action#business-rules-examples).
A business person or specialist can use DMN to design this business rule, without having to delve into technical definitions.
Here is an example of an **MVEL** script defined as a business rule action inside a **Service Task** node:
```java
if (input.application.client.gender == 'F') {
output.put("application", {
"client": {
"salutation": "Ms"
}
});
} else if (input.application.client.gender == 'M') {
output.put("application", {
"client": {
"salutation": "Mr"
}
});
} else {
output.put("application", {
"client": {
"salutation": "Mx"
}
});
}
```
The previous example can be easily transformed into a DMN Business Rule action represented by the decision table:
![DMN Decision Table](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_decision_ex.png)
In the example above, we used FEEL expression language to write the rules that should be met for the output to occur. FEEL defines a syntax for expressing conditions that input data should be evaluated against.
**Input** - In the example above, we used the user-selected gender from the first screen as input, bound to the `application.client.gender` key.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_screen.png)
**Output** - In the example above, we used the salutation (bound to `application.client.salutation`) computed based on the user's gender selection.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_salutation.png)
DMN also defines an XML schema that allows DMN models to be used across multiple DMN authoring platforms. The following output is the XML source of the decision table example from the previous section:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

# Extracting additional data in business rules
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/extracting-additional-data
Business rules in FlowX.AI allow you to extract and use key values dynamically. This is essential for handling user security details, configuration parameters, and business logic calculations.
<Info>
This guide is covering the following:
✅ Retrieving security details dynamically\
✅ Extracting specific user attributes\
✅ Fetching configuration parameters
</Info>
## Extracting security details
Security details (`securityDetails`) store user-related data, including **email, username, roles, and permissions**. These values are stored in `additionalData.securityDetails` and can be accessed dynamically within a process.
### Retrieve security details
Use the following business rule to fetch and store security details:
```JavaScript
// Retrieve security details from additionalData
securityDetails = additionalData.get("securityDetails");
// Store the extracted security details
output.put("securityDetails", securityDetails);
```
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/image%20%2813%29.png)
</Frame>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-02-25%20at%2013.32.37.png)
</Frame>
Example output:
```json
{
"securityDetails": {
"Default": {
"owner": {
"username": "user@email.com",
"identifier": "f08b1452-7c4c-415c-ad6d-8bb2d2d14600",
"details": {
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Snow",
"email": "user@email.com",
"jwt": "your_jwt",
"roles": [],
"groups": [
"/Users/Flowx_demo",
"/superAdmin"
],
"attributes": {}
}
}
}
}
}
```
### Extract specific owner details
To retrieve specific attributes, such as email, username, first name, and last name, use this script:
```JavaScript
// Retrieve security details
securityDetails = additionalData.get("securityDetails");
// Extract owner details from the Default swimlane
email = securityDetails.Default.owner.details.email;username = securityDetails.Default.owner.username;
firstName = securityDetails.Default.owner.details.firstName;lastName = securityDetails.Default.owner.details.lastName;
// Store extracted details in the output
output.put("email", email);
output.put("username", username);
output.put("firstName", firstName);
output.put("lastName", lastName);
```
Extracted values:
* **Owner Email** (`securityDetails.Default.owner.details.email`)
* **Username** (`securityDetails.Default.owner.username`)
* **First Name** (`securityDetails.Default.owner.details.firstName`)
* **Last Name** (`securityDetails.Default.owner.details.lastName`)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/image%20%2814%29.png)
</Frame>
### Dynamic extraction by swimlane
If your application uses multiple swimlanes, retrieve the owner details dynamically:
```JavaScript
// Get security details
securityDetails = additionalData.get("securityDetails");
// Extract owner details based on the swimlane
ownerDetails = securityDetails.Default.owner.details;
<Info>
Default is the swimlane name in this example. Replace it with your swimlane name.
</Info>
// Store extracted values in the process instance
output.put("email", ownerDetails.email);
output.put("username", securityDetails.Default.owner.username);
output.put("firstName", ownerDetails.firstName);
output.put("lastName", ownerDetails.lastName);
```
Example output:
```json
{
"email": "user@email.com",
"username": "user@email.com",
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Snow"
}
```
***
## Extracting values from configuration parameters
To make business rules flexible, store configuration values in project configuration parameters instead of hardcoding them.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/image%20%2816%29.png)
</Frame>
### Retrieve configuration parameters
Use a business rule to fetch and store configuration parameter values dynamically:
```JavaScript
// Retrieve a configuration parameter (e.g., commission percentage)
commissionPercentage = additionalData.applicationConfiguration.get("commissionPercentage");
// Store the retrieved value in output in the process instance
output.put("commissionPercentage", commissionPercentage);
```
### Example use case: commission calculation
This example shows how to calculate a commission value dynamically using a configuration parameter.

</Frame>
#### Configuration parameters
| **Parameter Name**     | **Description**                                 | **Example Value** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `commissionPercentage` | The percentage used to calculate the commission | `0.05` (5%)       |
<Tip>
Configuration parameters can be modified in:
➡ FlowX.AI Designer → Your Project → Configuration Parameters
</Tip>
#### Process flow

# Kafka send action
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/kafka-send-action
The FlowX Designer offers various options to configure the Kafka Send Action through the Actions tab at the node level.
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
<Frame>
![Kafka Send Action Configuration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/kafka_send_action_confg.gif)
</Frame>
### Action Edit
* **Name** - Used internally to distinguish between different [actions](../actions/actions) within the process. Establish a clear naming convention for easy identification.
* **Order** - Sets the running order for multiple actions on the same node.
* **Timer Expression** - Enables a delay, using [ISO 8601 duration format](../node/timer-events/timer-expressions#iso-8601) (e.g., `PT30S` for a 30-second delay).
* **Action Type** - Designate as **Kafka Send Action** for sending messages to external systems.
* **Trigger Type** - Always set to Automatic.
<Info>
The Kafka Send Action type is always **Automatic**. Typically, Kafka Send Actions automatically trigger when the process reaches this step.
</Info>
* **Required Type** (Mandatory/Optional) - **Automatic** actions are typically set as **mandatory**. Manual actions can be either mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - Allows triggering the action multiple times if required.
* **Autorun Children** - When activated, child actions (mandatory and automatic) execute immediately after the parent action concludes.
### Parameters
You can add parameters via the **Custom** option or import predefined parameters from an integration.
<Info>
For detailed information on **Integrations management**, refer to [<u>**this link**</u>](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/integration-management/).
</Info>
* **Topics** - Specifies the Kafka topics listened to by the external system for requests.
* **Message** - Contains the message payload to be dispatched.
* **Advanced Configuration (Headers)** - Represents a JSON value sent within the Kafka message headers.

## Dynamic Kafka topics
You can use dynamic topic names for Kafka Send and Kafka Receive actions in FlowX processes by leveraging Configuration Parameters. This enables flexibility when working with Kafka topics across different environments or use cases.
Steps to Create Dynamic Kafka Topics:
<Steps>
<Step title="Define Configuration Parameters for Kafka Topics">
Navigate to **Projects → Your Project → Configuration Parameters** in FlowX Designer.
Add or update configuration keys for Kafka topics.
Example:
* Key: `kafka_send_2`
* Value: `ai.flowx.plugin.document.trigger`
* Key: `kafka_receive`
* Value: `ai.flowx.engine.receive.plugin.document`
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-02-24%20at%2017.47.57.png)
</Frame>
This allows referencing these parameters dynamically in your Kafka actions.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Configuration Parameters in Kafka Send Action">
Open the process where you want to configure the Kafka Send Action.
Go to Node Config > Actions.
Select Kafka Send Action as the action type.
Under Parameters, locate the Topics field.
Use a dynamic reference to concatenate a parameter with another value:
`${kafka_send_2}.${topic2}`
Here:
* `${kafka_send_2}` dynamically pulls the value from Configuration Parameters.
* `${topic2}` can be another dynamic input set within the process.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure the Kafka Message Payload">
Define the JSON structure for the message payload.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-02-24%20at%2018.03.36.png)
</Frame>
Ensure that all required fields align with the expected schema of the consuming system.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate and Test the Configuration">
Start the process and check whether messages are correctly sent to the Kafka topic.
If needed, modify the configuration parameters to change the topic dynamically.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Kafka send action scenarios

# Send data to user interface
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/send-data-to-user-interface
Send data to user interface action is based on Server-Sent Events (SSE), a web technology that enables servers to push real-time updates or events to clients over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. It provides a unidirectional communication channel from the server to the client, allowing the server to send updates to the client without the need for the client to continuously make requests.
**Why is it useful?** It provides real-time updates and communication between the **process** and the frontend application.
## Configuring a Send data to user interface action
Multiple options are available for this type of action and can be configured via the **FlowX Designer**. To configure a Send data to user interface, use the **Actions** tab at the [task node level](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-a-new-node), which has the following configuration options:
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Back in steps (for Manual actions)](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Data to send (for Manual actions)](#data-to-send)
### Action Edit
* **Name** - used internally to make a distinction between different actions on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to be able to quickly find the process actions
* **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, the running order should be set using this option
* **Timer expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [**ISO 8601 duration format**](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) (for example, a delay of 30 seconds will be set up as `PT30S`)
* **Action type** - should be set to Send data to user interface
* **Trigger type** (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); in most use cases, this will be set to automatic
* **Required type** (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times
* **Autorun Children** - when this is switched on, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized
### Back in steps
* **Allow BACK on this action** - back in process is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process and redo a series of previous actions in the process. For more details, check [Moving a token backwards in a process](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) section.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/websocket_action_edit.png)
</Frame>
### Parameters
The following fields are required for a minimum configuration of this type of action:
* **Message Type** - if you only want to send data, you can set this to **Default** (it defaults to the **data** message type)
<Warning>
If you need to start a new process using a **Send data to user interface**, you can do that by setting the **Message Type** to **Action** and you will need to define a **Message** with the following format:
</Warning>
```json
{
"processName": "demoProcess",
"type": "START_PROCESS_INHERIT",
"clientDataKeys":["webAppKeys"],
"params": {
"startCondition": "${startCondition}",
"paramsToCopy": []
}
}
```
<Info>
* `paramsToCopy` - choose which of the keys from the parent process parameters to be copied to the subprocess
* `withoutParams` - choose which of the keys from the parent process parameters are to be ignored when copying parameter values from the parent process to the subprocess
</Info>
* **Message** - here you define the data to be sent as a JSON object, you can use constant values and values from the process instance data.
* **Target Process** - is used to specify to what running process instance should this message be sent - **Active process** or **Parent process**
<Info>
If you are defining this action on a [**Call activity node**](../node/call-subprocess-tasks/call-activity-node), you can send the message to the parent process using **Target Process: Parent process**.
</Info>
### Data to send
* **Keys** - are used when data is sent from the frontend via an action to validate the data (you can find more information in the [User task configuration](../node/user-task-node) section)
<Warning>
**Data to send** option is configurable only when the action **trigger type** is **Manual**.
</Warning>
<Frame>

</Frame>
### Send update data example
To send the latest value from the [process instance](../../projects/runtime/active-process/process-instance) data found at `application.client.firstName` key, to the frontend app, you can do the following:
1. Add a **Send data to user interface**.
2. Set the **Message Type** to **Default** (this is default value for `data`).
3. Add a **Message** with the data you want to send:
* `{ "name": "${application.client.firstName}" }`
4. Choose the **Target Process**.

# Start integration workflow action
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/start-integration-workflow
The Start Integration Workflow action initiates a configured workflow to enable data processing, transformation, or other tasks across connected systems.
The Start integration workflow action allows for data transfer by sending configured inputs to initiate workflows and receiving outputs at the designated result key once the workflow completes. Here’s an overview of its key functionalities:
### Triggering
When a Start integration workflow action is triggered:
* The input data mapped in Input is sent as start variables to the workflow.
* The workflow runs with these inputs.
* Workflow output data is captured on the the specified result key upon completion.
### Integratiom mapping
The Select Workflows dropdown displays:
* All workflows within the current application version.
* Any workflows referenced in the application (e.g., via the Library).
### Workflow output
To receive output data from a workflow:
* Add a Receive Message Task node to the BPMN process.
* This node ensures that output data is properly captured and processed based on the designated workflow configuration.
# Start new project instance
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/start-new-project-instance
The Start New Project Instance action allows users to initiate a completely new process (referred to as a "main process") from within an ongoing process. This functionality is designed to support scenarios where isolated use cases are managed across different applications or environments.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/start_new_project_instance.png)
</Frame>
### Key considerations
* The "Start New Project Instance" action **cannot be configured as a subaction**. It must always be a standalone action.
* This action is exclusively triggered **manually**; automated execution is not supported.
<Info>
You can launch a new project instance, which will always use the active version of the target application's build at the time of execution.
</Info>
***
## Common use cases
This action is particularly useful when multiple use cases are managed separately and require isolation between applications. For example:
1. **Customer Profile Management:**
* Onboarding a power of attorney.
* Submitting a mortgage request.
* Enrolling in a credit card program.
Each of these processes may be managed by different teams and applications, emphasizing the need for separation and flexibility.
2. **Cross-Application Workflow Initiation:**
A process in one application might require triggering a process in another application with specific parameters. For instance:
* Initiating an "Onboarding" process (version 2) for a customer directly from the main application.
## Configuring the action
The **Start New Project Instance** action is configured via the **FlowX Designer**. To set it up, navigate to the **Actions** tab at the [task node level](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-a-new-node).
### Configuration options
#### Action settings
* **Name:** Used internally to distinguish actions on nodes. It’s recommended to define a naming standard for easier identification.
* **Order:** If multiple actions exist on the same node, specify the order in which they run.
* **Timer Expression:** Adds a delay to the action if needed. Use the [**ISO 8601 duration format**](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) (e.g., `PT30S` for a 30-second delay).
* **Action Type:** Must be set to **Start New Project Instance**.
* **Trigger Type:** Always set to **Manual**.
* **Required Type:**
* **Mandatory:** Required for automatic actions.
* **Optional or Mandatory:** Can be used for manual actions.
* **Repeatable:** Check this box if the action can be triggered multiple times.
* **Autorun Children:** Automatically runs child actions (mandatory and automatic) immediately after the parent action completes.
* **Allow Back on This Action:** Enables users to move back in the process flow and redo previous actions. For details, see [Moving a Token Backwards in a Process](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process).
<Info>
The "Start New Project Instance" action is incompatible with subprocess configurations because projects, unlike libraries, are self-contained collections of resources designed to satisfy specific use cases. Libraries provide reusable, lightweight resources and routines, such as error handling or enumerations, and do not manage complex business logic.
</Info>
#### Parameters
The following parameters must be configured for the action:
* **Project:** Specifies the target project to be initiated.
* **Process:** Selects the process from the list of processes available in all builds.
* **Start with Parameters:** Defines the parameters passed to the new process. These parameters can include:
* **Customer Name:** Useful for initiating flows tailored to a specific customer.
* **Copied Data:** Information from the current process that is required to start the target application’s process.
<Frame>

</Frame>
***
## Key benefits
* **Isolated Process Management:** Supports launching new, isolated processes in separate applications, ensuring flexibility and independence across teams and environments.
* **Active Version Execution:** Ensures that the project instance uses the active build version at the time of initiation, providing consistency in functionality.
* **Parameter Passing:** Enables seamless data transfer between the initiating and target processes, improving operational efficiency.
# Start subprocess action
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/start-subprocess-action
A Start subprocess action is an action that allows you to start a subprocess from another (parent) process.
Using **subprocesses** is a good way to split the complexity of your business flow into multiple, simple and reusable processes.
## Configuring a Start subprocess action
To use a process as a [subprocess](../process/subprocess) you must first create it. Once the subprocess is created, you can start it from another (parent) process. To do this, you will need to add a **Start Subprocess** action to a [**User task**](../node/task-node) node in the parent process or by using a [Call activity node](../node/call-subprocess-tasks/call-activity-node).
Here are the steps to start a subprocess from a parent process:
1. First, create a [process](../process/process-definition) designed to be used as a [subprocess](../process/subprocess).
2. In the parent process, create a **user task** node where you want to start the subprocess created at step 1.
3. Add a **Start subprocess** action to the task node.
4. Configure the **Start Subprocess** action and from the dropdown list choose the subprocess created at step 1.
By following these steps, you can start a subprocess from a parent process and control its execution based on your specific use case.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/process_subprocess1.png)
The following properties must be configured for a **Start subprocess** action:
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Back in steps (for Manual actions)](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Data to send (for Manual actions)](#data-to-send)
### Action edit
* **Name** - used internally to make a distinction between different actions on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to be able to quickly find the process actions
* **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, the running order should be set using this option
* **Timer expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format ](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)(for example, a delay of 30 seconds will be set up as `PT30S`)
* **Action type** - should be set to **Start Subprocess**
* **Trigger type** (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); in most use cases, this will be set to automatic
* **Required type** (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times
* **Autorun Children** - when this is switched on, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized
### Back in steps
* **Allow BACK on this action** - back in process is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process and redo a series of previous actions in the process. For more details, check [**Moving a token backwards in a process**](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) section.
### Parameters
* **Subprocess name** - the name of the process that you want to start as a subprocess
* **Branch** - a dropdown menu displaying available branches on the subprocess (both opened and merged)
* **Version** - the type of version that should be used within the subprocess
<Info>
- **Latest Work in Progress**:
* Displayed if the selected branch is not merged into another branch.
* This configuration is used when there is a work-in-progress (WIP) version on the selected branch or when there is no WIP version on the selected branch due to either work in progress being submitted or the branch being merged.
* In such cases, the latest available configuration on the selected branch is used.
- **Latest Submitted Work**:
* This configuration is used when there is submitted work on the selected branch, and the current branch has been submitted on another branch (latest submitted work on the selected branch is not the merged version).
- **Custom Version**:
* Displayed if the selected branch contains submitted versions.
</Info>
* **Custom version** - displayed if the selected branch contains submitted versions
* **Copy from current state** - if a value is set here, it will overwrite the default behavior (of copying the whole data from the subprocess) with copying just the data that is specified (based on keys)
* **Exclude from current state** - what fields do you want to exclude when copying the data from the parent process to the subprocess (by default all data fields are copied)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/subprocess_version.png)
**Advanced configuration**
* **Show Target Process** - ID of the current process, to allow the subprocess to communicate with the parent process (which is the process where this action is configured)
### Data to send
* **Keys** - are used when data is sent from the frontend via an action to validate the data (you can find more information in the [**User task configuration**](../node/user-task-node) section)
<Warning>
**Data to send** option is configurable only when the action **trigger type** is **Manual**.
</Warning>
## Example
Let's create a main **process**, in this process we will add a user task node that will represent a menu page. In this newly added node we will add multiple subprocess actions that will represent menu items. When you select a menu item, a subprocess will run representing that particular menu item.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/subprocess_menu1.png)
To start a subprocess, we can, for example, create the following minimum configuration in a user task node (now we configure the process where we want to start a subprocess):
* **Action** - `menu_item_1` - used internally to make a distinction between different actions on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to be able to quickly find the process actions
* **Trigger type** - Manual; Optional
* **Repeatable** - yes
* **Subprocess** - `docs_menu_item_1` - the name of the process that you want to start as a subprocess
* **Exclude from current state** - `test.price` - copy all the data from the parent, except the price data
* **Copy from current state** - leave this field empty in order to copy all the data (except the keys that are specified in the **Exclude from current state** field), if not, add the keys from which you wish to copy the data
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/subprocess_example2.png)
**Advanced configuration**
* **Target process (parentProcessInstanceId)** - `${processInstanceId}` - current process ID

# Upload file action
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/actions/upload-file-action
An Upload File action is an action type that allows you to upload a file to a service available on Kafka.
**Why is it useful?** The action will receive a file from the frontend and send it to Kafka, and will also attach some metadata.
## Configuring an Upload file action
Multiple options are available for this type of action and can be configured via the **FlowX Designer**. To configure an Upload File action, use the **Actions** tab at the [task node level](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node), which has the following configuration options:
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Back in steps (for Manual actions)](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Data to send (for Manual actions)](#data-to-send)
### Action edit
* **Name** - used internally to make a distinction between different actions on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to be able to quickly find the process actions
* **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, the running order should be set using this option
* **Timer expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format ](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)(for example, a delay of 30 seconds will be set up as `PT30S`)
* **Action type** - should be set to **Upload File**
* **Trigger type** (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); in most use cases, this will be set to automatic
* **Required type** (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times
* **Autorun Children** - when this is switched on, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/upload_file_action_edit.png)
### Back in steps
* **Allow BACK on this action** - back in process is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process and redo a series of previous actions in the process. For more details, check [Moving a token backwards in a process](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) section.
### Parameters
* **Address** - the Kafka topic where the file will be posted
* **Document Type** - other metadata that can be set (useful for the [document plugin](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview))
* **Folder** - allows you to configure a value by which the file will be identified in the future
* **Advanced configuration (Show headers)** - this represents a JSON value that will be sent on the headers of the Kafka message
### Data to send
* **Keys** - are used when data is sent from the frontend via an action to validate the data (you can find more information in the [User Task configuration](../node/user-task-node) section)
<Warning>
**Data to send** option is configurable only when the action **trigger type** is **Manual**.
</Warning>
## Example
An example of **Upload File Action** is to send a file to the [document plugin](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview). In this case, the configuration will look like this:
**Parameters configuration**
* **Address (topicName)** - will be set to (the id of the document plugin service) `ai.flowx.in.document.persist.v1`
* **Document Type** - metadata used by the document plugin, here we will set it to`BULK`
* **Folder** - the value by which we want to identify this file in the future (here we use the **client.id** value available on the process instance data: `${application.client.id}`
**Advanced configuration**
* **Headers** - headers will send extra metadata to this topic -`{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}, "destinationId": "curentNodeName"}`)

# Call activity node
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/call-subprocess-tasks/call-activity-node
Call activity is a node that provides advanced options for starting subprocesses.
There are cases when extra functionality is needed on certain nodes to enhance process management and execution.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/call_activity1.png)
</Frame>
<Card title="Subprocess" href="../../process/subprocess" icon="link" />
The Call Activity node contains a default action for starting a subprocess, which can be started in two modes:
* **Async mode**: The parent **process** will continue without waiting for the subprocess to finish.
<Info>
Select if this task should be invoked asynchronously. Make tasks asynchronous if they cannot be executed instantaneously, for example, a task performed by an outside service.
</Info>
* **Sync mode**: The parent process must wait for the subprocess to finish before advancing.
The start mode can be chosen when configuring the call activity.
If the parent process needs to wait for the subprocess to finish and retrieve results, the parent process key that will hold the results must be defined using the *output key* node configuration value.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ca_output_key.png)
</Frame>
## Starting multiple subprocesses
This node type can also be used for starting a set of subprocesses that will be started and run at the same time.
This is useful when there is an array of values in the parent process parameters, and a subprocess needs to be started for each element in that array.

#### Business rule example
Below is an example of an MVEL business rule used to generate a list of shipping codes:
```java
import java.util.*;
def mapValues(shippingCode) {
return {
"shippingCode": shippingCode
}
}
shippingCodeList = [];
shippingCodeList.add(mapValues("12456"));
shippingCodeList.add(mapValues("146e3"));
shippingCodeList.add(mapValues("24356"));
shippingCodeList.add(mapValues("54356"));
output.put("shippingCodeList", shippingCodeList);
```
In this example, the shippingCodeList array contains multiple shipping code maps. Each of these maps could represent parameters for individual subprocesses. The ability to generate and handle such arrays allows the system to dynamically start and manage multiple subprocesses based on the elements in the array, enabling parallel processing of tasks or operations.
To achieve this, select the *parallel multi-instance* option. The *collection key* name from the parent process also needs to be specified.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ca_collection.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
When designing such a subprocess that will be started in a loop, remember that the input value for the subprocess (one of the values from the array in the parent process) will be stored in the subprocess parameter values under the key named *item*. This key should be used inside the subprocess. If this subprocess produces any results, they should be stored under a key named *result* to be sent back to the parent process.
</Info>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ca_subprocess.png)
</Frame>
#### Subprocess business rule example
Here's an MVEL business rule for a subprocess that processes shipping codes:
```java
import java.util.*;
map = new HashMap();
if (input.item.shippingCode.startsWith("1")) {
map.package = "Fragile";
} else {
map.package = "Non-fragile";
}
map.shippingCode = input.item.shippingCode;
output.put("result", map);
```
## Result (one of the subprocess instances)
The result shows the output of a process that has handled multiple shipping codes. The structure is:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ca_result.png)
</Frame>
```json
{
"package": "Non-fragile",
"shippingCode": "54356"
}
```
This contains the result of processing the specific shipping code, indicating additional attributes related to the shipping code (e.g., package type) determined during the subprocess execution.
# Start embedded subprocess
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/call-subprocess-tasks/start-embedded-subprocess
The Start Embedded Subprocess node initiates subprocesses within a parent process, allowing for encapsulated functionality and enhanced process management.
## Overview
The Start Embedded Subprocess node enables the initiation of subprocesses within a parent process, offering a range of features and options for enhanced functionality.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/start_embedded_subprocess.png)
</Frame>
## Usage Considerations
### Data Management
Embedded subprocesses offer advantages such as:
* Segregated sections from a subprocess can be utilized without rendering them over the parent process.
* Data is stored within the parent process instance, eliminating the need for data transfer.
* Embedded subprocesses are visible in the navigation view.
### Runtime Considerations
**Important** runtime considerations for embedded subprocesses include:
* The **child process** must have only **one swimlane**.
* Runtime swimlane permissions are inherited from the parent.
* Certain boundary events are supported on Start Embedded Subprocess node, except for Timer events (currently not implemented).
<Warning>
Embedded subprocesses cannot support multiple swimlanes in the actual implementation.
</Warning>
## Example
Let's explore this scenario: Imagine you're creating a process that involves a series of steps, each akin to a sequential movement of a stepper. Now, among these steps, rather than configuring one step from scratch, you can seamlessly integrate a pre-existing process, treating it as a self-contained unit within the overarching process.

</Step>
<Step title="Navigation Areas">
Design your navigation areas to match your needs.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/embedded_example_copy.png)
</Frame>
<Check>
Make sure you allocated all your user tasks into the navigation area accordingly.
</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Design Subprocess">
Within the selected process, design the subprocess by adding necessary tasks, events and so on. Ensure that the subprocess is contained within **a single swimlane**.
</Step>
</Steps>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/subprocess_to_embed.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Customize Data Handling">
Within the subprocess, handle data as needed. Remember that data is stored within the parent process instance when using embedded subprocesses.
</Step>
<Step title="Implement Boundary Events">
Implement boundary events within the subprocess if specific actions need to be triggered based on certain conditions.
</Step>
</Steps>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/subprocess_instance.gif)

# Error events
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/error-events
Error Events expand the capabilities of process modeling and error handling within BPMN processing. These Error Event nodes enhance the BPMN standard and offer improved control over error management.

## Intermediate event - error event (interrupting)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/error_event.png#center)
</Frame>
## Compatibility matrix for Error Events
**Error Events** are used to handle error scenarios within BPMN processes. The following table outlines their compatibility with different node types:
| **Node Type**            | **Error Boundary Event** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **User Task**            | Yes                      |
| **Service Task**         | Yes                      |
| **Send Message Task**    | Yes                      |
| **Receive Message Task** | Yes                      |
| **Subprocess**           | Yes                      |
| **Call Activity**        | Yes                      |
## Key characteristics
1. **Boundary of an Activity node or Subprocess:**
* Error Events can only be used on the boundary of an activity, including subprocesses nodes. They cannot be placed in the normal flow of the process.
2. **Always Interrupt the Activity:**
* It's important to note that Error Events always interrupt the activity to which they are attached. There is no non-interrupting version of Error Events.
3. **Handling Thrown Errors:**
* A thrown error, represented by an Error Event, can be caught by an Error Catch Event. This is achieved specifically using an Error Boundary Event, which is placed on the boundary of the corresponding activity.
4. **Using error events on Subprocesses nodes**:
* An error catch event can be linked to a subprocess, with the error source residing within the subprocess itself, denoted by the presence of an error end event, signifying an abnormal termination of the subprocess.
## Configuring an Error Intermediate boundary event
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/error_scenario.png)
</Frame>
* **Name**: Assign a name to the event for easy identification.
* **Condition**: Specify the condition that triggers the error event. Various script languages can be used for defining conditions, including:
* MVEL
* JavaScript
* Python
<Info>
To draw a sequence from an error event node and link it to other nodes, simply follow these steps: right-click on the node, and then select the option to "Add Sequence."
</Info>
<Info>
When crafting a condition, use a predefined key as illustrated below:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/scenario_input.gif)
</Frame>
For instance, in the example provided, we've taken a process key defined on a switch UI element and constructed a user-defined condition like this: `input.application.switch == true`.
</Info>
* **Priority**: Determine the priority level of this error event in relation to other error events added on the same node.
When multiple error events are configured for a node, and multiple conditions simultaneously evaluate to true, only one condition can interrupt the ongoing activity and advance the token to the next node. The determination of which condition takes precedence is based on the "priority" field.
If the "priority" field is set to "null," the system will randomly select one of the active conditions to trigger the interruption.
<Info>
* `input.application.switch`: This represents a key to bind a value to the Switch UI element within the "application" part of the "input". It is used in this example to capture input or configuration from a user.
* `==`: This is an equality operator, and it checks if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right.
* `true` is a boolean value, which typically represents a state of "true" or "on."
So, when you put it all together, the statement is checking if the value of the "input.application.switch" is equal to the string "true." If the value of "input.application.switch" is indeed "true" (as a string), the condition is considered true. If the value is anything other than "true," the condition is false and the error is triggered.
</Info>
### Use case: handling errors during User Task execution
**Description:** This use case pertains to a page dedicated to collecting client contact data. Specifically, it deals with scenarios where users are given the opportunity to verify their email addresses and phone numbers.
<Check>
In this scenario we will create a process to throw an error if an email address is not valid.
</Check>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/error_execution.png)
</Frame>
#### Example configuration
1. **Error Boundary Event:** We will set an error boundary event associated with a user task.
2. **Error Node:** The node will be responsible to redirect the user to other flows after the user's email address is validated based on the conditions defined.
```java
input.application.client.contactData.email.emailAddress  !=  "john.doe@email.com"
```
<Info>
The expression checks if the email address configured in `application.client.contactData.email.emailAddress` key is not equal to "[john.doe@email.com](mailto:john.doe@email.com)." If they are not the same, it evaluates to true, indicating a mismatch.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/input_val_v1.png)
</Frame>
</Info>
3. **Flow Control:** Depending on the outcome of the validation process, users will be directed to different flows, which may involve displaying error modals as appropriate.

# Exclusive gateway
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/exclusive-gateway-node
In the world of process flows, decisions play a crucial role, and that's where the Exclusive Gateway comes into play. This powerful tool enables you to create conditional pathways with ease.
## Configuring an Exclusive Gateway node
<Frame>
![Exclusive gateway](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/gateway_exclusive.png#center)
</Frame>
To configure this node effectively, it's essential to set up both the **input** and **output** sequences within the gateway process.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/gateway_exclusive_diagram.png)
### General configuration
* **Node name**: Give your node a meaningful name.
* **Can go back**: Enabling this option allows users to revisit this step after completing it.
<Info>
When a step has "Can Go Back" set to false, all preceding steps become inaccessible.
</Info>
* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes): Choose a swimlane, ensuring that specific user roles have access only to certain process nodes. If there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**.
* [**Stage** ](../../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management/using-stages): Assign a stage to the node.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/gateway_exclusive_stages.png)
### Gateway decisions
* **Language**: When configuring conditions, you can use [MVEL](/4.0/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel) (or [DMN](#dmn-example)) expressions that evaluate to either **true** or **false**.
* **Conditions**: In the **Gateway Decisions** tab, you can see that the conditions (**if, else if, else**) are already built-in and you can **select** the destination node when the condition is **true**.
<Warning>
The order of expressions matters; the first **true** evaluation stops execution, and the token moves to the selected node.
</Warning>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/gateway_rule.png)
After the exclusive portion of the process, where one path is chosen over another, you'll need to either end each path (as in the example below) or reunite them into a single process (as in the example above) using a new exclusive gateway without any specific configuration.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/end_other_FLOW.png)
## MVEL example
### Getting input from a Switch UI element
Let's consider the following example: we want to create a process that displays 2 screens and one modal. The gateway will direct the token down a path based on whether a switch element (in our case, VAT) is toggled to true or false.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/vat_example.png)
If, during the second screen, the VAT switch is toggled on, the token will follow the second path, displaying a modal.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/vat_on.gif)
After interacting with the modal, the token will return to the main path, and the process will continue its primary flow.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/process_run_xor.png)
#### Example configuration
* **Language**: MVEL
* **Expression**:
```java
input.application.company.vat == true // you can use the same method to access a value for other supported scripts in our platform: JavaScript, Python and Groovy
```
<Info>
Essentially, you are accessing a specific value or property within a structured data object. The format is usually `input.{{key from where you want to access a value}}`. In simpler terms, it's a way to verify if a particular property within your input data structure (input.application.company.vat key attached to Switch UI element) is set to the value true. If it is, the condition is met and returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
</Info>
<Check>
To ensure that the stored data can be accessed by the `.input method`, add a "Data to send" action on the node where you define your keys and your UI.
</Check>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/config_example_xor.png)
<Info>
The `application.company.vat` key corresponds to the switch UI element.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/VAT_key.png)
</Info>
## DMN example
If you prefer to use [DMN](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-dmn) to define your gateway decisions, you can do so using exclusive gateways.
![Gateway Decisions](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_gif.gif)
### Getting input from a Switch UI element
**Gateway Decision - DMN example** [(Applicable only for Exclusive Gateway - XOR)](./exclusive-gateway-node)
![Gateway Decision](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/xor_dmn_decision.png)
#### Configuration example
* **Language**: DMN
* **Expression**: `application.company.vat`
<Info>
In our case, the expression field will be filled in with `application.company.vat` key, which corresponds to the switch UI element.
</Info>
* **Hit Policy**: Unique
* **Type**: Boolean
* **Next Node name**: Enter the name of the nodes to which you prefer the token to be directed.
### Getting input from multiple UI elements
Consider another scenario in which the process relies on user-provided information, such as age and membership status, to determine eligibility for a discount. This decision-making process utilizes a DMN (Decision Model and Notation) decision table, and depending on the input, it may either conclude or continue with other flows.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_input.gif)
#### Configuration example
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dmn_multiple_UI_elements.png)
<Info>
In our case, the expressions fields will be populated with the `application.company.vat` and `application.client.membership` keys, which correspond to the user input collected on the initial screen.
</Info>
The process is visualized as follows:

# Message catch boundary events
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-catch-boundary-event
Boundary events are integral components linked to user tasks within a process flow. Specifically, Message Catch Boundary Events are triggered by incoming messages and can be configured as either interrupting or non-interrupting based on your requirements.
**Why is it important?** It empowers processes to actively listen for and capture designated messages during the execution of associated user tasks.
When an event is received, it progresses through the sequence from the intermediate **node**. Multiple intermediate boundary events can exist on the same user task, but only one can be activated at a time.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_catch_boundary_multiple.png)
</Frame>
Message Catch Boundary Events can be categorized by their behavior, resulting in two main classifications:
* [**Interrupting**](#message-catch-interrupting-event)
* [**Non-interrupting**](#message-catch-non-interrupting-event)
## Message catch interrupting event
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_catch_interrupting_event.png#center)
</Frame>
In the case of an Interrupting Message Catch Boundary Event triggered by a received message, it immediately interrupts the ongoing task. The associated task concludes, and the **process flow** advances based on the received message.
* **Use Cases:**
* Suitable for scenarios where the receipt of a specific message requires an immediate interruption of the current activity.
* Often used when the received message signifies a critical event that demands prompt attention.
* **Example:**
* A user task is interrupted as soon as a high-priority message is received, and the process flow moves forward to handle the critical event.
## Message catch non-interrupting event
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/%20message_catch_non_interrupting.png#center)
</Frame>
Contrastingly, a Non-Interrupting Message Catch Boundary Event continues to listen for messages during the execution of the associated task without immediate interruption. The task persists in its execution even upon receiving messages. Multiple non-interrupting events can be activated concurrently while the task is still active, allowing the task to continue until its natural completion.
* **Use Cases:**
* Appropriate for scenarios where multiple messages need to be captured during the execution of a user task without disrupting its flow.
* Useful when the received messages are important but do not require an immediate interruption of the ongoing activity.
* **Example:**
* A user task continues its execution while simultaneously capturing and processing non-critical messages.
## Compatibility matrix for Message Events
**Message Events** can be used in various contexts within BPMN processes. The following table outlines their compatibility with the following nodes:
| **Node Type**                 | **Message Catch Event - Interrupting** | **Message Catch Event - Non-Interrupting** |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **User Task**                 | Yes                                    | Yes                                        |
| **Service Task**              | Yes                                    | Yes                                        |
| **Send Message Task**         | No                                     | No                                         |
| **Receive Message Task**      | Yes                                    | Yes                                        |
| **Start Embedded Subprocess** | Yes                                    | Yes                                        |
| **Call Activity**             | Yes                                    | Yes                                        |
## Configuring a message catch interrupting/non-interrupting event
#### General config
* **Correlate with Throwing Events** - the dropdown lists all throw events from accessible process definitions
<Info>
Establishes correlation between the catch event and the corresponding throw event. Selection of the relevant throw event triggers the catch event upon message propagation.
</Info>
* **Correlation Key** - process key used to correlate received messages with specific process instances
<Info>
The correlation key associates incoming messages with specific process instances. Upon receiving a message with a matching correlation key, the catch event is triggered.
</Info>
* **Receive Data (Process Key)** - the catch event can receive and store data associated with the message in a process variable with the specified process key
<Info>
This received data becomes available within the process instance, facilitating further processing or decision-making.
</Info>

**Business Scenario:**
A customer initiates the account opening process. Identity verification occurs, and after successful verification, a message is thrown to signal that the account is ready for activation.
Simultaneously, the account activation process begins. If there are issues during activation, they are handled through the interruption process. The overall process ensures a streamlined account opening experience while handling potential interruptions during activation, and also addresses exceptions through the third lane.
# Message catch start event
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-catch-start-event
Message Catch Start Event node represents the starting point for a process instance based on the receipt of a specific message. When this event is triggered by receiving the designated message, it initiates the execution of the associated process.
**Why it is important?** The Message Catch Start Event is important because it allows a process to be triggered and initiated based on the reception of a specific message.
## Configuring a message catch start event
A Message Catch Start Event is a special event in a process that initiates the start of a process instance upon receiving a specific message. It acts as the trigger for the process, waiting for the designated message to arrive. Once the message is received, the process instance is created and begins its execution, following the defined process flow from that point onwards. The Message Catch Start Event serves as the entry point for the process, enabling it to start based on the occurrence of the expected message.
<Warning>
It is mandatory that in order to use this type of node together with task management plugin, to have a service account defined in your identity solution. For more information, check our documentation in how to create service accounts using Keycloak, [**here**](../../../../setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#process-engine-service-account).

* **Correlate with catch events** - Should match the configuration in the message catch start event.
* **Correlation key** - A process key that uniquely identifies the instance to which the message is sent.
* **Send data** - Define a JSON structure with the data to be sent along with the message. In our example, we will send a test object:
```json
{"test": "docs"}
```
* **Stage** - Assign a stage to the node if needed.

# Message Events
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-events
Message events serve as a means to incorporate messaging capabilities into business process modeling. These events are specifically designed to capture the interaction between different process participants by referencing messages.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_events_new.png)
</Frame>
By leveraging message events, processes can pause their execution until the expected messages are received, enabling effective coordination and communication between various system components.

| Message | A Message Intermediate Event serves to send or receive messages. A filled marker denotes a "throw" event, while an unfilled marker indicates a "catch" event. This either advances the process or alters the flow for exception handling. Identifying the Participant is done by connecting the Event to a Participant through a Message Flow. | Throw ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/throw_message_event.png#center) Catch ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_catch_intermediate_event.png#center) |
## Boundary events
Boundary Events involve handling by first consuming the event occurrence. Message Catch Boundary Events, triggered by incoming messages, can be configured as either interrupting or non-interrupting.
| Trigger | Description                                                                                                                    |                                                                  Marker                                                                  |

| Message | **Interrupting Message Catch Event**: The event can be triggered at any time while the associated task is being performed, interrupting the task. | Interrupting ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_catch_interrupting_event.png#center) |
## Intermediate vs boundary
**Intermediate Events**
* Intermediate events temporarily halt the process instance, awaiting a message.
**Boundary Interrupting Events**
* These events can only be triggered while the token is active within the parent node.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/token_interrupting.png)
* Upon activation, the parent node concludes, and the token progresses based on the boundary flow.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/token_intterrupting_exec.png)
**Boundary Non-Interrupting Events**
* Similar to interrupting events, non-interrupting events can only be triggered while the token is active in the parent node.
* Upon triggering, the parent node remains active, and a new token is generated to execute the boundary flow concurrently.
FLOWX.AI works with the following message events nodes:
* [**Message catch start event**](./message-catch-start-event)
* [**Message intermediate events**](./message-intermediate/)
* [**Message catch boundary event**](./message-catch-boundary-event)
## Message events correlation
Messages are not sent directly to process instances. Instead, message correlation is achieved through message subscriptions, which consist of the message name and the correlation key (also referred to as the correlation value).
<Info>
A correlation key is a key that can have the same value across multiple instances, and it is used to match instances based on their shared value. It is not important what the attribute's name is (even though we map based on this attribute), but rather the value itself when performing the matching between instances.
For example, in an onboarding process for a user, you hold a unique personal identification number (SSN), and someone else needs a portion of your process, specifically the value of your input (SSN).
</Info>
The communication works as follows: you receive a message on a Kafka topic - `${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}.core.message.event.process${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}`. The engine listens here and writes the response.
## Message events configuration
* `attachedTo`: a property that applies to boundary events
* `messageName`: a unique name at the database level, should be the same for throw and catch events
* `correlationKey`: a process variable used to uniquely identify the instance to which the message is sent
* `data`: allows defining the JSON message body mapping as output and input
### Data example
```json
{
"document":{
"documentId": "${document.id}",
"documentUrl": "${document.url}"
}
}
```
# Intermediate message events in business processes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-intermediate/example-intermediate-message-events
Business processes often involve dynamic communication and coordination between different stages or departments. Intermediate Message Events play an important role in orchestrating information exchange, ensuring effective synchronization, and enhancing the overall efficiency of these processes.

## Throw and catch on sequence - Credit card request process example
### Business scenario
In the following example, we'll explore a credit card request process that encompasses the initiation of a customer's request, verification based on income rules, approval or rejection pathways, and communication between the client and back office.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/throw_catch_intermediate_process.png)
</Frame>
#### Activities
##### Default swimlane (client)
* **Start Event:** Marks the commencement of the process.
* **User Task 1:** Customer Requests New Credit Card - Involves the customer submitting a request for a new credit card.
* **Exclusive Gateway:** The process diverges based on the verification result (dependent on income rules).
* **Path A (Positive Verification):**
* **User Task 2:** Approve Credit Card Application - The bank approves the credit card application.
* **End Event:** Denotes the conclusion of the process for approved applications.
* **Path B (Negative Verification):**
* **Parallel Gateway Open:** Creates two parallel zones.
* **First Parallel Zone:**
* **User Task 3:** Reject Credit Card Application - The bank rejects the credit card application.
* **Message Throw Intermediate Event:** Signals the rejection, throwing a message to notify the back office department.
* **End Event:** Signifies the end of the process for rejected applications.
* **Second Parallel Zone:**
* **User Task 3:** Reject Credit Card Application - The bank rejects the credit card application.
* **Message Catch Intermediate Event:** The back office department is notified about the rejection.
* **Send Message Task**: A notification is sent via email to the user about the rejection.
* **End Event:** Signifies the end of the process for rejected applications.
##### Backoffice swimlane
* **Message Catch Intermediate Event:** The back office department awaits a message to proceed with credit card issuance.
* **Send Message Task:** Send Rejection Letter - Involves sending a rejection letter to the customer.
### Sequence flow

```
### Message flows
A message flow connects the Message Throw Intermediate Event to the Message Catch Intermediate Event, symbolizing the communication of credit card approval from the credit card approval task to the back office department.
In summary, when a customer initiates a new credit card request, the bank verifies the information. If declined, a message is thrown to notify the back office department. The Message Catch Intermediate Event in the back office awaits this message to proceed with issuing and sending the rejection letter to the customer.
### Configuring the BPMN process
To implement the illustrated BPMN process for the credit card request, follow these configuration steps:
<Steps>
<Step>
**FLOWX.AI Designer**: Open FLOWX.AI Designer.
</Step>
<Step>
**Draw BPMN Diagram**: Import the provided BPMN diagram into FLOWX.AI Designer or recreate it by drawing the necessary elements.
</Step>
<Step>
**Customize Swimlanes**: Set up the "Default" and "Backoffice" swimlanes to represent different departments or stakeholders involved in the process. This helps visually organize and assign tasks to specific areas.
</Step>
<Step>
**Define User Tasks**: Specify the details for each user task. Configure User Task 1, User Task 2, and User Task 3 with appropriate screens.
* **User Task 1** - *customer\_request\_new\_credit\_card*
<Tip>
We will use the value from `application.income` key added on the slider UI element to create an MVEL business rule in the next step.

### Configuring intermediate message events
Configuring message events is a crucial step in orchestrating effective communication and synchronization within a business process. Whether you are initiating a message throw or awaiting a specific message with a catch, the configuration process ensures information exchange between different components of the process.
In this section, we explore the essential steps and parameters involved in setting up message events to optimize your BPMN processes.
### Message throw intermediate event
A Message Throw Intermediate Event is an event in a process where a message is sent to trigger communication or action with another part of the process (can be correlated with a catch event). It represents the act of throwing a message to initiate a specific task or notification. The event creates a connection between the sending and receiving components, allowing information or instructions to be transmitted. Once the message is thrown, the process continues its flow while expecting a response or further actions from the receiving component.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_throw_intrmdt.png)
</Frame>
#### General Configuration
* **Can go back?** - Setting this to true allows users to return to this step after completing it. When encountering a step with `canGoBack` false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
* **Correlate with catch message events** - The dropdown contains all catch messages from the process definitions accessible to the user, in our example: `throwcatchsequenceloan`
<Info>
It is imperative to define the message for the catch event first. This ensures its availability in the dropdown menu when configuring the throw intermediate event.
</Info>
* **Correlation key** - This is a process key that uniquely identifies the instance to which the message is sent. In our example, we utilized the `processInstanceId` as the identifier, dynamically generated at runtime. This key is crucial for establishing a clear and distinct connection between the sender and recipient in the messaging process.
<Info>
A correlation key is a key that can have the same value across multiple instances, and it is used to match instances based on their shared value. It is not important what the attribute's name is (even though we map based on this attribute), but rather the value itself when performing the matching between instances.
</Info>
* **The Send data field** - This feature empowers you to define a JSON structure containing the data to be transmitted alongside the message. In our illustrative example, we utilized dynamic data originating from user input, specifically bound to a slider UI element.
```json
{"value": "${application.income}"}
```
* **Stage** - Assign a stage to the node.
In the end, this is what we have:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_throw_config.png)
</Frame>
### Message catch intermediate event
A Message Catch Intermediate Event is a type of event in a process that waits for a specific message before continuing with the process flow. It enables the process to synchronize and control the flow based on the arrival of specific messages, ensuring proper coordination between process instances.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_catch_intrmdt.png)
</Frame>
#### General Configuration
* **Can go back?** - Setting this to true allows users to return to this step after completing it. When encountering a step with `canGoBack` false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
* **Correlate with throwing events** - The dropdown contains all catch messages from the process definitions accessible to the user (must be the same as the one assigned in Message throw intermediate event)
* **Correlation key** - Process key used to establish a correlation between the received message and a specific process instance (must be the same as the one assigned in Message throw intermediate event).
* **Receive data** - The process key that will be used to store the data received from the throw event along with the message.
* **Stage** - Assign a stage to the node.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_catch_intrmdt_cfg.png)
</Frame>
### Testing the final result
After configuring the BPMN process and setting up all the nodes, it is crucial to thoroughly test the process to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
<Info>
We will test the path where the user gets rejected.
</Info>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/testing_the_proc_interm.gif)
</Frame>
In the end, the user will receive this notification via email:

## Interprocess communication with throw and catch events
Facilitate communication between different processes by using message intermediate events.
### Business scenario
Consider a Bank Loan Approval process where the parent process initiates a loan application. During the execution, it throws a message to a subprocess responsible for additional verification.
#### Activities
**Parent Process:**
* **Start Event:** A customer initiates a loan application.
* **Start Subprocess:** Initiates a subprocess for additional verification.
* **User Task:** Basic verification steps are performed in the parent process.
* **Throw Message:** After the basic verification, a message is thrown to indicate that the loan application is ready for detailed verification.
* **End Event:** The parent process concludes.
**Subprocess:**
* **Start Event:** The subprocess is triggered by the message thrown from the parent process.
* **Catch Message:** The subprocess catches the message, indicating that the loan application is ready for detailed verification.
* *(Perform Detailed Verification and Analysis)*
* **End Event:** The subprocess concludes.
### Sequence flow
```mermaid
graph TD
subgraph Parent Process
a[Start]
b[Start Subprocess]
c[Throw message to another process]
d[User Task]
e[End]
end
subgraph Subprocess
f[Start]
g[Catch event in subprocess]
h[End]
end
a --> b --> c --> d --> e
f --> g --> h

# Message catch intermediate event
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-intermediate/message-catch-intermediate-event
A Message Catch Intermediate Event is a type of event in a process that waits for a specific message before continuing with the process flow.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_catch_intermediate_event.png#center)
</Frame>
**Why it is important?** It enables the process to synchronize and control the flow based on the arrival of specific messages, ensuring proper coordination between process instances.
Similar to the message catch boundary event, the message catch intermediate event is important because it facilitates the communication and coordination between process instances through messages. By incorporating this event, the process can effectively synchronize and control the flow based on the arrival of specific messages.
<Info>
Message Catch Intermediate Event can be used as a standalone node, this means that it will block a process until it receives an event.
</Info>
## Configuring a message catch intermediate event
Imagine a process where multiple tasks are executed in sequence, but the execution of a particular task depends on the arrival of a certain message. By incorporating a message catch intermediate event after the preceding task, the process will pause until the expected message is received. This ensures that the subsequent task is not executed prematurely and allows for the synchronization of events within the process.

# Message intermediate events overview
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-intermediate/message-intermediate
An intermediate event is an occurrence situated between a start and an end event in a process or system. It is represented by a circle with a double line. This event can either catch or throw information, and the directional flow is indicated by connecting objects, determining whether the event is catching or throwing information.

</Frame>
### Message throw intermediate event
This event throws a message and continues with the process flow.
It enables the sending of a message to a unique destination.

### Message catch intermediate event
This event waits for a message to be caught before continuing with the process flow.

# Message throw intermediate event
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-events/message-intermediate/message-throw-intermediate-event
Using a Throw intermediate event is like throwing a message to tell someone about something. After throwing the message, the process keeps going, and other parts of the process can listen to that message.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/throw_message_event.png#center)
</Frame>
**Why it is important?** The Message Throw Intermediate Event is important because it allows different parts of a process to communicate and share information with each other.
## Configuring a message throw intermediate event
A Message throw intermediate event is an event in a process where a message is sent to trigger a communication or action with another part of the process (can be correlated with a catch event). It represents the act of throwing a message to initiate a specific task or notification. The event creates a connection between the sending and receiving components, allowing information or instructions to be transmitted. Once the message is thrown, the process continues its flow while expecting a response or further actions from the receiving component.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_throw_intrmdt.png)
</Frame>
#### General config
* **Can go back?** - setting this to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it, when encountering a step with `canGoBack` false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable
* **Correlate with catch events** - the dropdown contains all catch messages from the process definitions accessible to the user
* **Correlation key** - is a process key that uniquely identifies the instance to which the message is sent
* **The data field** - allows the user to define a JSON structure with the data to be sent along with the message
* **Stage** - assign a stage to the node

# Send message/receive message tasks
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node
Send message task and Receive message task nodes are used to handle the interaction between a running process and external systems. This is done using Kafka.
## Send message task
This node is used to configure messages that should be sent to external systems.
<Frame>
![Send Message Task](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/send-task_node.svg#center)
</Frame>
### Configuring a send message task
Node configuration is done by accessing the **Node Config** tab. You have the following configuration options for a send message task:
#### General configuration
Inside the **General Config** tab, you have the following properties:
* **Node Name** - the name of the node
* **Can Go Back** - switching this option to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it
<Info>
When encountering a step with `canGoBack` switched to false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
</Info>
* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes) - choose a swimlane (if there are multiple swimlanes on the process) to ensure only certain user roles have access to certain process nodes; if there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**
* [**Stage**](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-stages) - assign a stage to the node
<Frame>
![General Config](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_send_task_action.png)
</Frame>
To configure a send message task, we first need to add a new node and then configure an **action** (**Kafka Send Action** type):
<Steps>
1. Open <Tooltip tip="The process designer is a component of FlowX.Ai Designer that allows users to create and design business processes using process definitions.">**Process Designer** </Tooltip> and start configuring a process.
2. Add a **send message task** node.
3. Select the **send message task** node and open the **Node Configuration**.
4. Add an <Tooltip tip="Actions in the FLOWX.AI platform are used to define the activity that a node has to handle. They can have various types and are used to specify the communication details for plugins or integrations."> **action** </Tooltip>, the type of the action set to **Kafka Send Action**.
5. A few action parameters will need to be filled in depending on the selected action type.
</Steps>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/kafka_send_task.gif)
Multiple options are available for this type of action and can be configured via the FLOWX.AI Designer. To configure and [add an action to a node](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node), use the **Actions** tab at the node level, which has the following configuration options:
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Back in steps (for Manual actions)](#back-in-steps)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Data to send (for Manual actions)](#data-to-send)
#### Action Edit
* **Name** - used internally to make a distinction between different [actions](../actions/actions) on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to easily find the process actions
* **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, set the running order using this option
* **Timer Expression** - it can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format](./timer-events/timer-expressions#iso-8601) (for example, a delay of 30 seconds will be set up as `PT30S`)
* **Action Type** - should be set to **Kafka Send Action** for actions used to send messages to external systems
* **Trigger Type** (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); in most use cases, this will be set to automatic
* **Required Type** (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
* **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times
* **Autorun Children** - when this is switched on, the child actions (the ones defined as mandatory and automatic) will run immediately after the execution of the parent action is finalized
#### Back in steps
* **Allow BACK on this action** - back in the process is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process and redo a series of previous actions in the process, or for more details, check [**Moving a Token Backwards in a Process**](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) section
<Frame>
![Action Edit](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_send_action_edit.png)
</Frame>
#### Data to Send
* **Keys** - are used when data is sent from the frontend via an action to validate the data (you can find more information in the [User Task Configuration](./user-task-node) section)
<Warning>
You can configure **Data to Send** option only when the action **trigger type** is **Manual**.

### Example of a send message task usage
Send a message to a CRM integration to request a search in the local database:
#### Action Edit
* **Name** - pick a name that makes it easy to figure out what this action does, for example, `sendRequestToSearchClient`
* **Order** - 1
* **Timer Expression** - this remains empty if we want the action to be triggered as soon as the token reaches this node
* **Action Type** - Kafka Send Action
* **Trigger Type** - *Automatic* - to trigger this action automatically
* **Required Type** - *Mandatory* - to make sure this action will be run before advancing to the next node
* **Repeatable** - false, it only needs to run once
#### Parameters
<Info>
Parameters can be added either using the **Custom** option (where you configure everything on the spot) or by using **From Integration** and import parameters already defined in an integration.
More details about **Integrations Management** you can find [here](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/integration-management/integration-management-overview).
</Info>
##### Custom
* **Topics** - `ai.flowx.in.crm.search.v1` the Kafka topic on which the CRM listens for requests
* **Message** - `{ "clientType": "${application.client.clientType}", "personalNumber": "${personalNumber.client.personalNumber}" }` - the message payload will have two keys, `clientType` and `personalNumber`, both with values from the process instance
* **Headers** - `{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}}`

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/message_send_param3.png)
## Receive Message Task
This type of node is used when we need to wait for a reply from an external system.
<Frame>
![Receive Message Task](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/receive-task%20_node.svg#center)
</Frame>
The reply from the external system will be saved in the process instance values, on a specified key. If the message needs to be processed at a later time, a timeout can be set using the [ISO 8601](./timer-events/timer-expressions) format.
For example, let's think about a CRM microservice that waits to receive requests to look for a user in a database. It will send back the response when a topic is configured to listen for the response.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/kafka_receive_message.png)
### Configuring a Receive Message Task
The values you need to configure for this node are the following:
* **Topic Name** - the topic name where the [process engine](../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) listens for the response (this should be added to the platform and match the topic naming rule for the engine to listen to it) - `ai.flowx.out.crm.search.v1`
<Warning>
A naming pattern must be defined on the process engine to use the defined topics. It is important to know that all the events that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the Engine. For example, `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` is the topic name pattern that the Engine listens to for incoming Kafka events.
</Warning>
* **Key Name** - will hold the result received from the external system; if the key already exists in the process values, it will be overwritten - `crmResponse`
For more information about Kafka configuration, click [here](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka).
![Example of a Receive Message Task for a CRM integration](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_receive_kafka_ex.png)
#### From integration
After defining one integration (inside [Integration Management](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/integration-management/)), you can open a compatible node and start using already defined integrations.
* **Topics** - topics defined in your integration
* **Message** - the **Message Data Model** from your integration
* **Headers** - all integrations have `processInstanceId` as a default header parameter; add any other relevant parameters

# BPMN nodes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/node
A Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) node is a visual representation of a point in your process. Nodes are added at specific process points to denote the entrance or transition of a record within the process.
<Tip>
For a comprehensive understanding of BPMN, start with the following section:
[**Intro to BPMN**](/4.0/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn).
</Tip>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/BPMN%20nodes.png)
FlowX.AI platforms support various node types, each requiring distinct configurations to fulfill its role in the business flow.
## Types of BPMN nodes
Let's explore the key types of BPMN nodes available in FlowX:
* **Start and End nodes** - Mark the initiation and conclusion of a [process flow](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn). A [process definition](../process/process-definition) may have multiple start nodes (each linked with a start condition) and end nodes based on the flow outcomes.
* **Send Message and Receive Message tasks** - Used for communication with external systems, integrations, and plugins.
* **Message Events** - Capture interactions between different process participants by referencing messages.
* **Timer Events** - Introduce time-based behavior into processes, triggering actions at specific intervals, durations, or cycles. They support configurations like specific dates, durations, or recurring cycles and can pause, start, or monitor tasks based on time conditions.
* **Error Events** -  Manage error handling in processes by interrupting tasks or subprocesses upon specific error conditions. Configured as boundary events, they catch and handle errors thrown within the process, ensuring robust error management and control.
* **Task** nodes - Added when a [business rule](../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) needs to execute during a process flow.
* **User Task** nodes - Configure the appearance and behavior of the UI and send data to custom components.
* **Exclusive Gateways** - Mark decision points in the process flow, determining the branch to be followed.
* **Parallel Gateways** - Split the process flow into two or more [branches](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-more-flow-branches) occurring simultaneously.
* **Call Subprocess Tasks**:
* **Call Activity** - Call activity is a node that provides advanced options for starting **subprocesses**.
* **Start Embedded Subprocess** - The Start Embedded Subprocess node initiates subprocesses within a parent process, allowing for encapsulated functionality and enhanced process management.
* **Boundary Events** - Specialized nodes that attach to specific tasks or subprocesses to handle predefined events during execution. They can be configured as interrupting or non-interrupting, with the following key types:
* **Message Catch Boundary Event** -  Waits for a specific message while the task or subprocess is active, interrupting or initiating a parallel flow based on configuration.
* **Timer Boundary Event** -  Triggers based on a specific time duration, date, or cycle. It can interrupt a task or start an additional flow without stopping the task.
* **Error Boundary Event** - Interrupts the associated task or subprocess upon an error, redirecting the process to a defined error-handling flow. Boundary events enhance process flexibility by enabling workflows to adapt dynamically to real-time conditions, ensuring robust error, message, and timeout handling.
For comprehensive insights into BPMN and its various node types, explore our course at FlowX Academy:
<Card title="BPMN 101" href="https://academy.flowx.ai/explore/bpmn-101" icon="school">
* What's BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) and how does it work?
* How is BPMN used in FlowX?
</Card>
### Boundary events
Boundary events attach to the boundary of specific nodes (e.g., User Task, Service Task, Subprocess, or Call Activity) and are triggered when predefined conditions occur. These events can interrupt the ongoing activity or allow it to continue while starting a parallel flow. They include:
* **Message Catch Boundary Event**: Waits for and responds to a specific incoming message during a task.
* **Timer Boundary Event**: Activates based on elapsed time, a specific date, or a recurring cycle, useful for timeouts or deadlines.
* **Error Boundary Event**: Catches errors during a task or subprocess and redirects the process flow to handle them appropriately.
<Frame>

</Frame>
**Compatibility Matrix**:
Boundary events can attach to the following node types:
* **User Task**
* **Service Task**
* **Send Message/Receive Message Tasks**
* **Subprocess (Embedded and Call Activity)**
Boundary events are a critical element for creating resilient and adaptive processes, enabling efficient error handling, timeout management, and real-time interactions.
After gaining a comprehensive overview of each node, you can experiment with them to create a process. More details are available in the following section:
[Managing a process flow](../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/)
# Parallel gateway
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/parallel-gateway
When you have multiple operations that can be executed concurrently, the Parallel Gateway becomes a valuable tool. This type of node creates a parallel section within the process, particularly useful for tasks that can run independently without waiting for each other. It's essential to close each parallel section with another Parallel Gateway node.
## Configuring parallel paths
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/gateway_parallel.png#center)
</Frame>
This node requires no special configuration and can initiate two or more parallel paths. It's important to note that the closing Parallel node, which is required to conclude the parallel section, will wait for all branches to complete before advancing to the next node.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/parallel_gateways.png)
### Configuration example
Let's consider a scenario involving a Paid Time Off (PTO) request. We have two distinct flows: one for the HR department and another for the manager. Initially, two tokens are generated—one for each parallel path. A third token is created when both parallel paths converge at the closing parallel gateway.
In the HR flow, in our example, the request is automatically approved.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/hr_flow.gif)
Now, we await the second flow, which requires user input.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/manager_flow.gif)
After the tokens from the parallel paths have completed their execution, a third token initiates from the closing parallel gateway.
# Start/end nodes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/start-end-node
Let's go through all the options for configuring start and end nodes for a process definition.
## Start node
The start node represents the beginning of a process and it is mandatory to add one when creating a process.
<Frame>
![Start node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/start_node.png#center)
</Frame>
A process can have one or more start nodes. If you defined multiple start nodes, each should have a start condition value configured. When starting a new process instance the desired start condition should be used.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/start_node_example.png)
### Configuring a start node
Node configuration is done by accessing the **Node Config** tab. You have the following configuration options for a **start node**:
* [General Config](#general-config)
* [Start condition](#start-condition)
#### General Config
* **Node name** - the name of the node
* **Can go back** - switching this option to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it
<Info>
When encountering a step with `canGoBack` switched to false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
</Info>
* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes) - choose a swimlane (if there are multiple swimlanes on the process) to make sure only certain user roles have access to certain process nodes- if there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**
* [**Stage**](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-stages)- assign a stage to the node
#### Start condition
The start condition should be set as a string value. This string value will need to be set on the payload for the start process request on the `startCondition` key.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/start_node_condition.png)
</Frame>
To test the start condition, we can send a start request via REST:
```
POST {{processUrl}}/api/process/{{processName}}/start
{
"startCondition": "PF"
}
```
#### Error handling on start condition
If a request is made to start a process with a start condition that does not match any start node, an error will be generated. Let's take the previous example and assume we send an incorrect value for the start condition:
```
POST {{processUrl}}/api/process/{{processName}}/start
{
"startCondition": "PJ"
}
```
A response with the error code `bad request` and title `Start node for process definition not found`will be sent in this case:
```json
{
"entityName": "ai.flowx.process.definition.domain.NodeDefinition",
"defaultMessage": "Start node for process definition not found.",
"errorKey": "error.validation.process_instance.start_node_for_process_def_missing",
"type": "https://www.jhipster.tech/problem/problem-with-message",
"title": "Start node for process definition not found.",
"status": 400,
"message": "error.validation.process_instance.start_node_for_process_def_missing",
"params": "ai.flowx.process.definition.domain.NodeDefinition"
}
```
## End node
<Frame>
![End Event](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/end-event.png#center)
</Frame>
An end node is used to mark where the process finishes. When the process reaches this node, the process is considered completed and its status will be set to `Finished`.
### Configuring an end node
Multiple end nodes can be used to show different end states. The configuration is similar to the start node.
![End node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/end_node.png)
# Task node
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/task-node
A task node refers to a task that utilizes various services, such as Web services, automated applications, or other similar services, to accomplish a particular task.
<Frame>
![Task node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/service_task.png#center)
</Frame>
This type of node finds application in multiple scenarios, including:
* Executing a [**business rule**](../actions/business-rule-action/) on the process instance data
* Initiating a [**subprocess**](../actions/start-subprocess-action)
* Transferring data from a subprocess to the parent process
* Transmitting data to frontend applications
## Configuring task nodes
One or more actions can be configured on a task node. The actions are executed in the configured order.
Node configuration is done by accessing the **Node Config** tab. You have the following configuration options for a task node:
#### General Config
* **Node name** - the name of the node
* **Can go back** - switching this option to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/task_node_general_config.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
When encountering a step with `canGoBack` switched to false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
</Info>
* [**Swimlane**](../../platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes) - choose a swimlane (if there are multiple swimlanes on the process) to make sure only certain user roles have access to certain process nodes- if there are no multiple swimlanes, the value is **Default**
* [**Stage** ](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-stages)- assign a stage to the node
#### Response Timeout
* **Response timeout** - can be triggered if, for example, a topic that you define and add in the [Data stream topics](#data-stream-topics) tab does not respect the pattern, the format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)(for example, a delay of 30s will be set up like `PT30S`)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/task_node_response_timeout.png)
</Frame>
#### Data stream topics
* **Topic Name** - the topic name where the [process engine](../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) listens for the response (this should be added to the platform and match the topic naming rule for the engine to listen to it) - available for UPDATES topics (Kafka receive events)
<Warning>
A naming pattern must be defined on the [process engine configuration](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka) to use the defined topics. It is important to know that all the events that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the Engine. For example, `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` is the topic name pattern where the Engine listens for incoming Kafka events.
</Warning>
* **Key Name** - will hold the result received from the external system, if the key already exists in the process values, it will be overwritten
#### Task Management
* **Update task management** - force [Task Management Plugin](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) to update information about this process after this node
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/task_node_task_management.png)
</Frame>
## Configuring task nodes actions
Multiple options are available when configuring an action on a task node. To configure and add an action to a node, use the **Actions** tab at the node level, which has the following configuration options:
* [Action Edit](#action-edit)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
#### Action Edit
<Info>
Depending on the type of the [**action**](../actions/actions), different properties are available, let's take a [**business rule**](../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) as an example.
</Info>
1. **Name** - used internally to differentiate between different actions on nodes in the process. We recommend defining an action naming standard to be able to quickly find the process actions.
2. **Order** - if multiple actions are defined on the same node, their running order should be set using this option
3. **Timer Expression** - can be used if a delay is required on that action. The format used for this is [ISO 8601 duration format ](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)(for example, a delay of 30s will be set up like `PT30S`)
4. **Action type** - defines the appropriate action type
5. **Trigger type** - (options are Automatic/Manual) - choose if this action should be triggered automatically (when the process flow reaches this step) or manually (triggered by the user); In most use cases, this will be set to automatic.
6. **Required type** - (options are Mandatory/Optional) - automatic actions can only be defined as mandatory. Manual actions can be defined as mandatory or optional.
7. **Repeatable** - should be checked if the action can be triggered multiple times
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/task_node_action_edit.png)
</Frame>
#### Parameters
<Info>
Depending on the type of the [**action**](../actions/actions), different properties are available. We refer to a **Business rule** as an example
</Info>
1. **Business Rules** - business rules can be attached to a node by using actions with action rules on them, these can be specified using [DMN rules](../actions/business-rule-action/dmn-business-rule-action), [MVEL](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel) expressions, or scripts written in Javascript, Python, or Groovy.
<Card title="Supported scripting languages" href="../../building-blocks/supported-scripts" icon="link" />
### Business Rule action
A [business rule](../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) is a Task action that allows a script to run. For now, the following script languages are supported:

# Timer boundary event
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-boundary-event
A Timer Boundary Event in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a specialized event attached to a specific task or subprocess within a process. It activates when a predefined time condition—such as a duration, deadline, or specific date—is met while the associated task or subprocess is still in progress.
This event is used to integrate time-related triggers into workflows, allowing processes to respond automatically to time-sensitive requirements. It is particularly useful for enforcing deadlines, scheduling periodic actions, or sending notifications, ensuring that time-critical steps are seamlessly incorporated into the overall process design.ary Events are utilized to incorporate time-related conditions into processes, enabling actions to be taken at specified time intervals, deadlines, or specific dates. This capability is especially valuable for scenarios where time-sensitive actions or notifications need to be integrated seamlessly within process flows.
### Compatibility matrix for Timer Events
**Timer Events** can be applied to various contexts within BPMN processes. The table below outlines their compatibility with different node types:
| **Node Type**                 | **Timer Event - Interrupting** | **Timer Event - Non-Interrupting** |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **User Task**                 | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Service Task**              | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Send Message Task**         | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Receive Message Task**      | Yes                            | Yes                                |
| **Start Embedded Subprocess** | No                             | No                                 |
| **Call Activity**             | Yes                            | Yes                                |
## Timer boundary event - interrupting
A Timer Boundary Event is an event attached to a specific activity (task or subprocess) that is triggered when a specified time duration or date is reached. It can interrupt the ongoing activity and initiate a transition.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/timer_boundary_event_interrupting.svg#center)
</Frame>
### Configuration
For Timer Boundary Events - Interrupting, the following values can be configured:
| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/intermediate_timer_event.png)
</Frame>
### General rules
* When the token enters the parent activity, a scheduler is set, and it waits for the timer event to be triggered.
* When the timer is triggered, the ongoing activity is terminated, and the process continues with the defined transition.
## Timer boundary event - non-interrupting
A Timer Boundary Event is an event attached to a specific activity (task or subprocess) that is triggered when a specified time duration or date is reached. It can trigger independently of the ongoing activity and initiate a parallel path.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/timer_boundary_event_non_interrupting.svg#center)
</Frame>
### Configuration
For Timer Boundary Events - Non-Interrupting, the following values can be configured:
| Field      | Validations | Accepted Values                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Mandatory   | ISO 8601 formats (date/duration) |
|            |             | Process param                    |
### General rules
* When a token arrives at a node with a Timer Boundary Event - Non-Interrupting associated:
* A trigger is scheduled, but the current token execution remains unaffected.
* When the token enters the parent activity, a scheduler is set, and it waits for the timer event to be triggered.
* If the timer is a cycle, it is rescheduled for the specified number of repetitions.
* The scheduler is canceled if the token leaves the activity before it is triggered.
# Timer events
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-events
Timer event nodes are a powerful feature in BPMN that allow you to introduce time-based behavior into your processes. These nodes enable you to trigger specific actions or events at predefined time intervals, durations, or cycles. With timer event nodes, you can design processes that respond to time-related conditions, ensuring smoother workflow execution and enhanced automation.
There are three primary types of timer event nodes:
* **Timer Start Event (interrupting/non-interrupting)**: This node initiates a process instance at a scheduled time, either interrupting or non-interrupting ongoing processes. It allows you to set a specific date, duration, or cycle for the process to start. You can configure it to trigger a process instance just once or repeatedly.
* **Timer Intermediate Event** (interrupting): This node introduces time-based triggers within a process. It's used to pause the process execution until a specified time duration or date is reached. Once triggered, the process continues its execution.
* **Timer Boundary Event (interrupting/non-interrupting)**: Attached to a task or subprocess, this node monitors the passage of time while the task is being executed. When the predefined time condition is met, the boundary event triggers an associated action, interrupting or non-interrupting the ongoing task or subprocess.

</Frame>
## Timers
Timers introduce the ability to trigger events at specific time intervals. They can be configured in three different ways: as a date, a duration, or a cycle. These configurations can use static values or dynamic/computed values.
* **Date**: Events triggered on a specific date and time.
* Format: ISO 8601 (e.g., `2019-10-01T12:00:00Z` or `2019-10-02T08:09:40+02:00`)
* **Time Duration**: Events triggered after a specified duration.
* Format: ISO 8601 duration expression (`P(n)Y(n)M(n)DT(n)H(n)M(n)S`)
* P: Duration designator
* Y: Years
* M: Months
* D: Days
* T: Time designator
* H: Hours
* M: Minutes
* S: Seconds
Examples:
* `PT15S` - 15 seconds
* `PT1H30M` - 1 hour and 30 minutes
* `P14D` - 14 days
* `P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S` - 3 years, 6 months, 4 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/timer_events_duration_date.gif)
</Frame>
* **Time Cycle** (available for Timer Start Event): Events triggered at repeating intervals.
* Option 1: ISO 8601 repeating intervals format (`R`)
* Examples:
* `R5/2023-08-29T15:30:00Z/PT2H`: Every 2 hours seconds, up to five times, starting with 29 August, 15:30 UTC time
* `R/P1D`: Every day, infinitely
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/timer_start_cycle.gif)
</Frame>
* Option 2: Using cron expressions
* Example: `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI`: Every hour on the hour from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC, Monday to Friday
<Warning>
Important: Only Spring cron expressions are permissible for configuration. Refer to the [**official documentation**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/4.0/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronExpression.html) for detailed information on configuring Spring Cron expressions.
</Warning>
Scheduled timer events are clearly indicated within the process definition list of an application at Runtime, as illustrated in the following example:

</Frame>
<Card title="Scheduled processes" href="../../../projects/runtime/scheduled-processes/" icon="page" />
More information about timer expressions you can find in the below section:
[Timer expressions](./timer-expressions)
## Configuration
For each node type, the following timer types can be configured:
| Node Type                | Date | Duration | Cycle |
| ------------------------ | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| Timer Start Event        | Yes  | No       | Yes   |
| Timer Intermediate Event | Yes  | Yes      | No    |
| Timer Boundary Event     | Yes  | Yes      | No    |
<Warning>
A process definition version should have a single Timer Start Event per swmilane.

# Timer expressions
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-expressions
When working with FlowX.AI components, there are multiple scenarios in which timer expressions are needed.
There are two timer expressions formats supported:
* [**Cron expressions**](#cron-expressions) - used to define the expiry date on processes
* [**ISO 8601**](#iso-8601) - used to define the duration of a response timeout or for a timer expression
### Cron expressions
A cron expression is a string made up of **six mandatory subexpressions (fields) that each specifies an aspect of the schedule** (for example, `* * * * * *`). These fields, separated by white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that field.
<Info>
A field may be an asterisk (`*`), which always stands for “first-last”. For the day-of-the-month or day-of-the-week fields, a question mark (`?`) may be used instead of an asterisk.
</Info>
<Warning>
Important: Only Spring cron expressions are permissible for configuration. Refer to the [**official documentation**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html#scheduling-cron-expression) for detailed information on configuring Spring Cron expressions.
</Warning>
Subexpressions:
1. Seconds
2. Minutes
3. Hours
4. Day-of-Month
5. Month
6. Day-of-Week
7. Year (optional field)
An example of a complete cron-expression is the string `0 0 12 ? * FRI` - which means **every Friday at 12:00:00 PM**.
More details:
[Scheduling cron expressions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#scheduling-cron-expression)
#### Cron Expressions are used in the following example:
* [**Process definition**](../../../building-blocks/process/process-definition) - **Expiry time** - a user can set up a `expiryTime` function on a process, for example, a delay of 30s will be set up like:

</Frame>
### ISO 8601
ISO 8601 is an international standard covering the worldwide exchange and communication of date and time-related data. It can be used to standardize the following: dates, time of delay, time intervals, recurring time intervals, etc.
More details:
[ISO 8601 date format](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_date_format.htm)
[ISO 8601 duration format](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs//90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm)
#### ISO 8601 format is used in the following examples:
* **Node config** - **Response Timeout** - can be triggered if, for example, a topic that you define and add in the **Data stream topics** tab does not respect the pattern
ISO 8601 dates and times:
| Format accepted      | Value ranges                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Year (Y)             | YYYY, four-digit, abbreviatted to two-digit  |
| Month (M)            | MM, 01 to 12                                 |
| Week (W)             | WW, 01 to 53                                 |
| Day (D)              | D, day of the week, 1 to 7                   |
| Hour (h)             | hh, 00 to 23, 24:00:00 as the end time       |
| Minute (m)           | mm, 00 to 59                                 |
| Second (s)           | ss, 00 to 59                                 |
| Decimal fraction (f) | Fractions of seconds, any degree of accuracy |

</Frame>
<Info>
Please note that a process definition version can accommodate only one **Timer Start Event**.
</Info>
## Configuration
The Timer Start Event supports two timer types:
| Timer Type | Description                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date       | Specifies an exact date and time for triggering the event (ISO 8601 format)           |
| Cycle      | Specifies a repeating interval using ISO 8601 repeating intervals or cron expressions |
<Info>
The Start Timer Event supports either ISO 8601 formats or Spring cron expressions for defining timer values.
</Info>
<Check>
Starting a process via registered timers requires sending a process start message to Kafka, necessitating a service account and authentication. For detailed guidance, refer to:
[**Service Accounts**](../../../../setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#scheduler-service-account)
</Check>
## Timer type details
### Date
Specifies an exact date and time for triggering the event. You can use ISO 8601 date format for accurate date-time representation.
When configuring a Date timer, you can set:
* **Date**: Select a specific date (format: yyyy-mm-dd) using the date picker
* **Time**: Set the specific time when the timer should trigger
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/start_timer_date.png)
</Frame>
### Cycle
Specifies a repeating interval for triggering the event. For the Cycle timer definition, you can use either:
#### ISO 8601 repeating intervals
For standardized time intervals (e.g., "R5/PT10M" for repeating 5 times with 10 minutes between each)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/start_timer_cycle_iso_repeating.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
When configuring a Cycle timer (ISO 8601 repeating intervals) you can set:
* **Repeat Every**: The interval between triggers (e.g., "2 hours")
* **# of repeats**: How many times the timer should trigger (e.g., "3")
* **Infinite**: Option to make the timer repeat indefinitely
* **Start Time**: When the timer should begin (format: yyyy-mm-dd)
</Tip>
#### Cron expressions
For more complex scheduling patterns (e.g., "0 0 12 \* \* MON-FRI" for 12pm every weekday)
<Frame>

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/start_timer_event_scenario.png)
</Frame>
* Start Event (Timer Start Event) - New Hire Start Date
* Timer Definition: 2023-09-01T09:00:00Z (ISO 8601 format) → This means the process will initiate automatically at the specified date and time.
* This event serves as the trigger for the entire process.
* Transition → Employee Onboarding Notification
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/start_timer_date_scenario.png)
</Frame>
* Employee Onboarding Notification
* Notify new employee about onboarding requirements by sending an email notification with a template called "Important Onboarding Information"
* Actions: The HR team or automated system sends out necessary email information/documents, and instructions to the new employee.
* After the notification is sent, the process transitions to the Complete Onboarding node.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/onboarding_notification.png)
</Frame>
* Complete Onboarding
* Employee onboarding completed
* At this point, the employee's onboarding process is considered complete.
* Actions: The employee may have completed required tasks, paperwork, or orientation sessions.
### General rules
* Schedulers are generated only for builds that are part of the active policy.
* If you change the active policy, processes with Timer Start Event nodes might appear or disappear from the scheduled processes list if they aren't part of the active build.
* You can view scheduled processes in the Runtime section under "Scheduled Processes" (available since version 4.6.0).
* When a build in the active policy is updated with new Timer Start Event settings:
* The scheduler is updated based on the new settings.
* The scheduler state (active or suspended) remains the same as before.
# User task node
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/node/user-task-node
This node represents an interaction with the user. It is used to display a piece of UI (defined in the UI Designer or a custom Angular component. You can also define actions available for the users to interact with the process.
## Configuring a user task node
<Frame>
![User Task Node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/user_task_node.png#center)
</Frame>
User task nodes allow you to define and configure UI templates and possible [actions](../actions/actions) for a certain template config node (ex: [button components](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons)).
#### General Config
* **Node name** - the name of the node
* **Can go back** - setting this to true will allow users to return to this step after completing it. When encountering a step with `canGoBack` false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
* [**Stage**](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-stages)- assign a stage to the node
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/node_config_new.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
When encountering a step with `canGoBack` switched to false, all steps found behind it will become unavailable.
</Info>
#### Data stream topics
* **Topic Name** - the topic name where the process engine listens for the response (this should be added to the platform and match the topic naming rule for the engine to listen to it) - available for UPDATES topics (Kafka receive events)
<Check>
A naming pattern must be defined on the [process engine configuration](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka) to use the defined topics. It is important to know that all the events that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the Engine. For example, `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` is the topic name pattern where the Engine listens for incoming Kafka events.
</Check>
* **Key Name** - will hold the result received from the external system, if the key already exists in the process values, it will be overwritten
#### Task Management
* **Update task management** - force [Task Management](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) plugin to update information about this process after this node

## Configuring the UI
The **FlowX Designer** includes an intuitive [UI Designer](../ui-designer/ui-designer) (drag-and-drop editor) for creating diverse UI templates. You can use various elements from basic [buttons](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), indicators, and [forms](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/), but also predefined [collections](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection) or [prototypes](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection_prototype).
### Accessing the UI Designer
To access the **UI Designer**, follow the next steps:
1. Open **FLOWX Designer** and from the **Processes** tab select **Definitions**.
2. Select a **process** from the process definitions list.
3. Click the **Edit** **process** button.
4. Select a **user task** **node** from the Pro dcess Designer then click the **brush** icon to open the **UI Designer**.

<Accordion title="Root components">
These elements are used to group different types of components, each having a different purpose:
* [**Card**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/card) - used to group and configure the layout for multiple **form elements.**
* [**Container**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/container) - used to group and configure the layout for multiple **components** of any type.
* [**Custom**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/custom) - these are Angular components developed in the container application and passed to the SDK at runtime, identified here by the component name
More details in the following section:
<Card title="Root components" href="../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/root-components" />
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI components">
The root component can hold a hierarchical component structure.
Available children for **Card** and **Container** are:
* **Container** - used to group and align its children
* **Form** - used to group and align form field elements (**inputs**, **radios**, **checkboxes**, etc)
* **Image** - allows you to configure an image in the document
* **Text** - a simple text can be configured via this component, basic configuration is available
* **Hint** - multiple types of hints can be configured via this component
* **Link** - used to configure a hyperlink that opens in a new tab
* **Button** - Multiple options are available for configuration, the most important part being the possibility to add actions
* **File Upload** - A specific type of button that allows you to select a file
More details in the following section:
<Card title="Component types" href="../ui-designer/ui-designer#user-task-node-ui-components" />
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Form elements">
This type of elements are used to allow the user to input data, and can be added only in a **Form** Component. They have have multiple properties that can be managed.
1. [**Input**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) - FLOWX form element that allows you to generate an input form filed
2. [**Select**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field) - to add a dropdown
3. [**Checkbox**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/checkbox-form-field) - the user can select zero or more input from a set of options
4. [**Radio**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/radio-form-field) - the user is required to select one and only one input from a set of options
5. [**Datepicker**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/datepicker-form-field) - to select a date from a calendar picker
6. [**Switch**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/switch-form-field) - allows the user to toggle an option on or off
More details in the following section:
<Card title="Form elements" href="../ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements" />
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
### Custom components
These are components developed in the web application and referenced here by component identifier. This will dictate where the component is displayed in the component hierarchy and what actions are available for the component.
To add a custom component in the template config tree, we need to know its unique identifier and the data it should receive from the process model.
More details in the following section:
<Card title="Custom" href="../ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/custom" />
# Data model
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/process/data-model
The Data Model is a centralized configuration feature that enables efficient management of key-value attributes inside process definitions. It supports multiple attribute types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, and enums, offering users the ability to define, update, delete, and apply data attributes seamlessly.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/data_model_new.png)
</Frame>
### Attribute types
The Data Model supports the following attribute types:
* STRING
* NUMBER
* CURRENCY
* BOOLEAN
* OBJECT
* ARRAY
* ARRAY OF STRINGS
* ARRAY OF NUMBERS
* ARRAY OF BOOLEANS
* ARRAY OF OBJECTS
* ARRAY OF ENUMS
* ENUM
* DATE
#### Currency attribute
Currencies are managed using an object structure that ensures accurate representation and localization.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-18%20at%2010.36.00.png)
</Frame>
* **Currency Object Structure**:
* Includes `amount` (numerical value) and `code` (ISO 4217 currency code, e.g., USD, EUR).
* Example:
```json
{
"amount": 12000.78,
"code": "USD"
}
```
* **Regional Formatting**:
* Currency values adapt to regional conventions for grouping, decimals, and symbol placement. For instance:
* **en-US (United States)**: `$12,000.78` (symbol before the value, comma for grouping, dot for decimals).
* **ro-RO (Romania)**: `12.000,78 RON` (dot for grouping, comma for decimals, code appended).
* **Fallback Behavior**: If the `code` is null, the system defaults to the locale's predefined currency settings.
* **UI Integration**:
* Currency input fields dynamically format values based on locale settings and save the `amount` and `code` into the data store.
* Sliders and other components follow the same behavior, formatting values and labels according to the locale.
<Card title=" Localization and internationalization" href="../ui-designer/localization-and-i18n" icon="page">

</Frame>
* **Locale-Specific Date Formats**: FlowX dynamically applies regional date formatting rules based on the locale. For instance:
* **en-US (United States)**: `MM/DD/YYYY` → `09/28/2024`
* **fr-FR (France)**: `DD/MM/YYYY` → `28/09/2024`
* **Customizable Formats**: You can choose from predefined formats (e.g., short, medium, long, full) or define custom formats at both application and UI Designer levels.
* **Timezone Handling**:
* **Standard Date**: Adjusts to the current timezone.
* **Date Agnostic**: Ignores time zones, using GMT for consistent representation.
* **ISO 8601 Compliance**: Ensures compatibility with international standards.

#### Number attribute
The **Number** attribute type supports two subtypes: **integers** and **floating point numbers**, providing flexibility to represent whole numbers or decimal values as required.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-18%20at%2010.41.25.png)
</Frame>
* **Subtypes**
* **Integer**: Represents whole numbers without any fractional or decimal part.
* Example: `1, 42, 1000`
* **Floating Point**: Represents numbers with a decimal point, enabling precise storage and representation of fractional values.
* Example: `3.14, 0.01, -123.456`
* **Locale-Specific Formatting**:
* Numbers adapt to regional conventions for decimal separators and digit grouping. For example:
* **en-US (United States)**: `1,234.56` (comma for grouping, dot for decimals)
* **de-DE (Germany)**: `1.234,56` (dot for grouping, comma for decimals)
* **fr-FR (France)**: `1 234,56` (space for grouping, comma for decimals)
* **Precision Settings**:
* **Minimum Decimals**: Ensures a minimum number of decimal places are displayed, adding trailing zeros if necessary.
* **Maximum Decimals**: Limits the number of decimal places stored, rounding values to the defined precision.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-18%20at%2010.42.16.png)

The Tab Bar is a crucial component in user interfaces, facilitating seamless navigation and content organization.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/tabs_view.gif)
</Frame>
Key Features and usage guidelines:
<CardGroup>
<Card title="Parallel Zones">
The navigation Tab Bar offers specialized support for **parallel zones** within the same **user task**. This feature allows users to navigate effortlessly between different sections or functionalities.
</Card>
<Card title="Multiple Tabs">
Users can access multiple tabs within the tab bar, enabling quick switching between various views or tasks.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/tab_bar_nav_area.png)
</Frame>
When setting up a tab bar zone in your BPMN diagram, ensure that you always initiate a parallel zone using **Parallel Gateway** nodes. This involves using one Parallel Gateway node to open the zone and another to close it, as demonstrated in the example above. This approach ensures clarity and consistency in your diagram structure, facilitating better understanding.
<Warning>
**Mobile development considerations**: when developing for mobile devices, ensure the tab bar is **always** positioned as a **root component** in the navigation. It should remain consistently visible, prioritizing ease of navigation.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/root_navigation_tab.png)
</Warning>
#### Tabs
Tabs are clickable navigation elements within the Tab Bar that allow users to switch between different sections or functionalities within an application.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/tabs_parallel.png)
</Frame>
Each tab could contain a user task or multiple user tasks that can be rendered in parallel.
<Info>
You can also use [**Start embedded subprocess**](../node/call-subprocess-tasks/start-embedded-subprocess) nodes to render defined subprocesses as a tab. Check the [**Start embedded subprocess**](../node/call-subprocess-tasks/start-embedded-subprocess) for more details.
</Info>
#### Tab bars inside tabs
In addition to regular tab bars, you have the option to implement nested tab bars, allowing for the display of another set of tabs when accessing a specific tab.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/nested_tab_bars.png)
</Frame>
To achieve this configuration, you'll need to create an additional parallel zone inside the previously created one for the main tab bar. This section should encompass the child tabs of the primary tab bar in your diagram. Once these child tabs are defined, close the parallel zone accordingly.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/sub_tabs.png)
</Frame>
### Page
Page navigation involves user interaction, typically through clicking on links, buttons, or other interactive elements, to transition from one page to another.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/page_smth.gif)
</Frame>
A page could contain multiple user tasks displayed either in parallel (single page application) or one by one (wizard style).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/page_overview.png)
</Frame>
#### Navigation type (only for Web)
<Tip>
This property is available starting with **v4.1.0** platform release.
</Tip>
You have the possibility to add step-by-step or wizard-style navigation within a page (applicable when a page contains more than one User Task). This means users can navigate through the application in a guided manner, accessing each step within the designated area and page.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/page_navigation_type.png)
* **Single page form** (default): The Web Renderer will display all User Tasks within the same page (in parallel).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/page_single_page.png)
<Tip>
For optimal navigation, we suggest utilizing cards to guide users through the content.
<Info>
To maintain a clean UI while displaying user tasks on a single page, use cards as the root UI elements and apply accordions to them. This allows you to collapse each card after it is validated by an action.
</Info>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/cards_single_page_coll.gif)
</Tip>
<Info>
Child areas will be rendered on the same page.
</Info>
* **Wizard**: For the Wizard option, the Web Renderer will display one user task at a time, allowing navigation using custom Next and Back buttons.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/page_wizard.gif)
<Tip>
Child areas will be presented sequentially. It's crucial to configure actions properly to ensure smooth user navigation.
</Tip>
### Modal
Modals offer temporary control over user interaction within a process, typically appearing as pop-ups or overlays. They guide users through specific tasks before returning to the main functionality of the application or website.
<Frame>
![Modal Example](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/modal.gif)
</Frame>
To enable user interaction with a modal, you can configure it to be dismissable in two ways:
* Dismiss on backdrop click
* Display dismiss confirmation alert
Here's how to configure these options:
1. Navigate to your configured modal and access the UI Designer.
<Frame>
![Modal UI Designer](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/modal_ui_designer.gif)
</Frame>
2. In the UI Designer navigation panel, select the **Settings** tab, then choose **Generic**.
3. Check the box labeled "dismissable." If you also want to display a dismiss confirmation alert, configure the:
* Title
* Message
* Confirm button label
* Cancel button label
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/modal_configuration.png)
</Frame>
By configuring these options, you can customize the behavior of your modals to enhance user experience and guide them effectively through tasks.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/modal_example.gif)
</Frame>
### Zone
A Zone serves as a container designed to govern UI navigation by grouping specific elements together. Its optimal application is in scenarios involving processes featuring both a header and footer.
#### Navigation type (only for Web)
You have the possibility to add step-by-step or wizard-style navigation within a specific zone (applicable when a zone contains more than one User Task). This means users can navigate through the application in a guided manner, accessing each step within the designated area and page.
* **Single page form** (default): The Web Renderer will display all User Tasks within the same zone.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/single_page_form.png)
<Tip>
For optimal navigation, we suggest utilizing cards to guide users through the content.
</Tip>
<Info>
Child areas will be rendered on the same page.
</Info>
* **Wizard**: For the Wizard option, the Web Renderer will display one user task at a time, allowing navigation using custom Next and Back buttons.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/wizard.gif)
<Tip>
Child areas will be presented sequentially. It's crucial to configure actions properly to ensure smooth user navigation.
</Tip>
<Warning>
Zones with headers and footers are exclusively accessible in web configurations. They are not supported as navigation areas for mobile development.
</Warning>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/header_footer.png)
</Frame>
#### How to Create a Header/Footer Zone
To establish a header/footer zone, follow these steps:
1. Begin by opening a new parallel zone and ensure to close it where you want the header/footer zone to end.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/header%3Afooter_parallel.gif)
</Frame>
2. Introduce two new user tasks nodes within your process, designated to function as the header, respectively as footer.
3. Connect the first parallel gateway node to both of them.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/connect_header_footer.png)
</Frame>
4. Now connect the header and footer user tasks to the closing Parallel Gateway.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/connect_with_closing.gif)
</Frame>
3. In the navigation areas menu, incorporate a new zone labeled "Header Zone" and a new zone "Footer Zone".
4. Position the header at the top of your navigation structure or at the top within your primary navigation element and the footer at the bottom.
5. Assign the user tasks to the "Header Zone" and to the "Footer Zone".
<Info>
When working with containers directly within navigation zones, you have the flexibility to set the sticky/static property directly on your specific navigation zone using the UI Designer, without having to add specific user tasks. However, determining the best practice depends on the specific use case you're aiming to implement.
For instance, if you're looking to incorporate footers containing actions or buttons such as "Cancel application" or "Continue," it's advisable to include user tasks, allowing you to configure node actions effectively.
<Tip>
On the other hand, if your goal is to integrate static headers and footers featuring branding assets and external URLs, it's simpler to directly add them to the navigation areas. In this scenario, you can effortlessly incorporate images or text with external URLs on your containers styling.
</Tip>
</Info>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/header_footer_blaa.png)
</Frame>
6. Proceed to customize the user tasks UI according to your preferences.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/header_footer_custom.gif)
</Frame>
#### Styling options
To customize the appearance of headers and footers, you need to utilize containers as the root UI elements for **user tasks** or navigation areas.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/container_ui.png)
</Frame>
You have two styling options available for these containers:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/sticky_configuration.gif)
</Frame>
* **Static**: This style remains fixed and does not scroll along with the page content.
* **Sticky**: When the sticky property is enabled, the container maintains its position even during scrolling.
* **Layout**: You have the option to specify minimum distances between the container and its parent element while scrolling. At runtime, sticky containers will keep their position on scroll relative to top/ bottom/ right/ left margin of the parent element
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%2017.18.39.png)

For more information, you can also check the following demo on our Academy website:
<Card title="FlowX.AI Navigation view" href="https://academy.flowx.ai/explore/flowxai-navigation-view" icon="school" />
## Alternative flows
There might be cases when you want to include or exclude process nodes based on some information that is available at start.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/alternative_flows.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
For example, in case of a bank onboarding process, you might want a few extra BPMN nodes in the process in case the person trying to onboard is a minor.
</Tip>
For these cases, we have added the possibility of defining **alternative flows**.
For each navigation area or node, you can choose to set if they are only available in certain cases. In the example below, we will create two alternative flows in which we will include two different steppers and one modal without being part of an alternative flow.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/adding_alternative_flows.gif)
</Frame>
When starting a process, you must mention for the which flow the process will be initiated using the "navigationFlow" parameter and the name of the alternative flow:
```json
{"navigationFlow": "First Flow"}
```
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/alternative_flows_ex.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
If a node is not assigned to an alternative flow, this means the node will be included in all possible flows.
<Tip>
A node could also be a part of multiple flow names.
</Tip>
</Info>
<Tip>
When configuring alternative flows in the main process, remember that they will also be applied in any embedded subprocesses with identical names.

<Card title="BPMN nodes" href="../node/node" icon="link" />
In the following sections, we will provide more details on how to use the Process Designer and its components.
## Process definition
The process is the core building block of the platform. Think of it as a representation of your business use case, for example making a request for a new credit card, placing an online food order, registering your new car or creating an online fundraiser supporting your cause.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/prs_def.png)
</Frame>
A process is nothing more than a series of steps that need to be followed in order to get to the desired outcome: getting a new credit card, gathering online donations from friends or having your lunch brought to you. These steps involve a series of actions, whether automated or handled by a human, that allows you to complete your chosen business objective.
<Card title="Process definition" href="./process-definition" icon="link" />
## Process instance
Once the desired processes are defined in the platform, they are ready to be used. Each time a process needs to be used, for example, each time a customer wants to request a new credit card, a new instance of the specified process definition is started in the platform. Think of the process definition as a blueprint for a house, and of the process instance as each house of that type that is being built.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/prs_instance.png)
</Frame>
From this point on, the platform takes care of following the process flow, handling the necessary actions, storing and interpreting the resulting data.

# Process definition
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/process/process-definition
The core of the platform is the process definition, which is the blueprint of the business process made up of nodes that are linked by sequences.
<Frame>

## Settings
### Process Name
* **Process definition name**: Edit the process definition name.
<Info>
Name can only contain letters, numbers and the following special characters: \[] () . \_ -
</Info>
### General
In the General settings, you can edit the process definition name, include the process in reporting, set general data, and configure expiry time expression using Cron Expressions and ISO 8601 formatting.
* **Available Platforms** (Single Choice): This enable configuration (Navigation Areas, UI Designer, Misconfigurations) only for the specific platform selected:
* **Web Only**:  If the navigation areas are defined exclusively for the Web, the process should remain set to Web. This is because it is optimized solely for web usage and would not provide the same level of functionality or user experience on mobile devices
* **Mobile Only**: If the navigation areas are defined only for Mobile, the process should be set to Mobile. This ensures that the process leverages mobile-specific features and design considerations, providing an optimal experience on mobile devices.
* **Omnichannel**: If the existing process has navigation areas defined for both Web and Mobile platforms, it should be set to Omnichannel. This ensures that users have a consistent experience regardless of the platform they are using.
<Tip>
This setting is available starting with **v4.1.0** platform release.
</Tip>
<Info>
Navigation Areas, UI Designer and misconfigurations will be affected by this setting.
</Info>
<Info>
By default, new processes are set to **Web Only**. This ensures that they are initially optimized for web-based usage, providing a starting point for most users and scenarios.
</Info>
* **Use process in reporting**: When enabled, this setting includes the process in reporting.
* **Use process in task management**: Enabling this option creates tasks that are displayed in the Task Manager plugin. For more details, refer to the [**Task Management**](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) section.
* **General data**: Refers to customizable data that can be both set and received in a response context.
* **Expiry time**: A user can set up an expiry time expression on a process definition to specify an expiry date.
| **Example**               | **Expression**         | **Explanation**                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily Expiry at Midnight  | `0 0 0 * * ?`          | Sets the process to expire at 00:00 (midnight) every day. The `?` is used in the day-of-week field to ignore its value. |
| Hourly Expiry on Weekdays | `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI` | Sets the process to expire at the start of each hour between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays (Monday to Friday).              |
| Expiry After a Duration   | `PT3M22S`              | Sets the process to expire after a duration of 3 minutes and 22 seconds from the start, using **ISO 8601 format**.      |
<Tip>
FlowX support Spring cron expressions. They  **must always include six fields**: `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `day of month`, `month`, and `day of week`.\
This differs from traditional UNIX cron, which uses only five fields. Be sure to include the `seconds` field in Spring cron expressions to avoid errors.
</Tip>
<Info>
The cron expression format should include seconds (0), minutes (0), hours (0), and then wildcards for the day, month, and day of the week fields. The `?` sign in the day-of-week field is used when the day-of-month field is already specified (or ignored in this case).
</Info>
<Info>
You can use both ISO 8601 duration format (`PT3M22S`) and cron expressions (`0 0 0 * * ?`, `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI`) to define `expiryTime` expressions for process definitions.
</Info>
For more information about **Cron Expressions** and **ISO 8601** formatting, check the following section:

</Frame>
### Permissions
After defining roles in the identity provider solution, they will be available to be used in the process definition settings panel for configuring swimlane access.
When you create a new swimlane, it comes with two default permissions assigned based on a specific role: execute and self-assign. Other permissions can be added manually, depending on the needs of the user.

<Card title="Configuring access rights for processes" href="../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-access-roles-for-processes" />
### Task management
* **Use process in task management**
* The Use Process in Task Management option enables the integration of a process definition with the Task Manager system.
* By activating this feature, the process becomes available for managing tasks within Task Management, allowing data, tasks, and status updates to flow between the process and the Task Manager.
* **Application url**
* The Application URL is the endpoint or link that directs users to the specific application instance where a process is executed. It serves as a reference point for accessing and managing tasks associated with a process directly from the Task Manager.
* Follows a standard format, e.g., `{baseURL}/appId/buildId/processes/resourceId/instance`.
* Can be dynamically defined using configuration parameters (e.g., `${genericParameter}`) or set at the process data level using business rules.
* **Keys to send to Task Manager**
* The Keys to Send to Task Manager configuration specifies the data fields (keys) from a process definition that are sent to the Task Manager for indexing and display.
* These keys are used to customize task-related views, filters, and parameters, making them accessible for tracking, filtering, and managing tasks effectively.
<Tip>
Important:
* Keys must exist in the process data model.
* Keys need re-indexing if their type or structure is updated in the data model.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Process Data Keys: These are paths or fields in the process definition that store relevant data. For example, customerDetails.fullName might correspond to a field capturing the full name of a customer.

# Subprocess management
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/process/subprocess
Learn how to configure, start, and execute subprocesses efficiently within your process flow.
Subprocesses are smaller process flows triggered by actions in the main process. They can inherit some process parameter values from the parent process and communicate with front-end apps using the same connection details as their parent process.
## Overview
Subprocesses can be started in two modes:
* **Asynchronous**: Execute alongside the parent process without delaying it.
* **Synchronous**: The parent process waits until subprocesses are finished before advancing.
## Configuring & starting subprocesses
Design subprocesses within the FlowX Designer, mirroring the main process structure.
<Steps>
<Step title="Start Subprocess Action">
* Within user tasks or task nodes.
</Step>
<Step title="Call Activity node">
* Custom node type in the main process.
</Step>
<Step title="Start Embedded Subprocess node">
* Using the corresponding node.
</Step>
</Steps>
### Parameter inheritance
<Info>
Available for **Start Subprocess** action and **Call Activity** node.
</Info>
By default, subprocesses inherit all parent process parameter values. Configure inheritance by:
* **Copy from Current State**: Select keys to copy.
* **Exclude from Current State**: Specify keys to ignore.
Sub-processes can also have an [**Append Params to Parent Process**](../actions/append-params-to-parent-process) action  configured inside their process definitions which will append their results to the parent process parameter values.
<Card title="Append Params to Parent Process" href="../actions/append-params-to-parent-process" icon="file" />
## Executing subprocesses
Define subprocess execution mode:
* **Asynchronous/Synchronous**: Set the `startedAsync` parameter accordingly.
In synchronous mode, subprocesses notify completion to the parent process. The parent process then resumes its flow and handles subprocess data.
## Additional resources

# Dynamic & computed values
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/dynamic-and-computed-values
In modern application development, the ability to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces is essential for delivering personalized and responsive experiences to users. Dynamic values and computed values are powerful features that enable developers to achieve this level of flexibility and interactivity.
## Dynamic values
Dynamic values give you the flexibility to fill various UI properties at runtime, based on process parameters or substitution tags. By doing so, your application can adapt to specific scenarios or user inputs.
Use this feature to fine-tune how your application appears and behaves without needing to rebuild or redeploy. The table below outlines which UI elements support dynamic values and the corresponding properties that can accept parameters or substitution tags.

### How it works
* **Process Parameters**: At runtime, values can be injected from backend logic or state, such as the outcome of an API call or an action, which then populate the relevant UI element properties.
* **Substitution Tags**: Whenever a UI property references a substitution tag key (e.g., `test`), the application replaces it with the appropriate content at runtime. This is particularly useful for rapid localization, real-time data injection, and user-specific content.

</Frame>
### Example using Substitution tags
<Tip>
Use keys beginning with "@@" to return their value. If a valid key isn't found, you'll get an empty string. If the key format is incorrect, the original string is returned.
</Tip>

#### Business rule example
In the preceding example, an MVEL business rule demonstrates the population of specific keys with dynamic values from the task. This JSON object, assigned to the "app" key, captures the values for various UI properties:
```json
///assigning a JSON object containing dynamic values for the specified keys to the "app" key
output.put("app",{"label":"This is a label",
"title":"This is a title",
"placeholder":"This is a placeholder",
"helpertext":"This is a helper text",
"errorM":"This is a error message",
"prefix":"prx",
"suffix":"sfx",
"subtitile":"This is a subtitle",
"message":"This is a message",
"defaultV":"defaultValue",
"value":"Value101",
"value":"Value101",
"confirmLabel":"This is a confirm label",
"cancelLabel":"This is a cancel label",
"defaultValue":"dfs",
"defaultDate":"02.02.2025",
"defaultSlider": 90});
```
<Warning>
Note that for releases **\< 3.3.0**, concatenating process parameters with substitution tags isn't supported when utilizing dynamic values.
</Warning>
## Computed values
Computed values present a method to dynamically generate values using JavaScript expressions. Beyond adhering to predefined values, computed values enable the manipulation, calculation, and transformation of data grounded in particular rules or conditions.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/computed1.png)
Computed values can be created via JavaScript expressions that operate on process parameters or other variables within the application.
<Tip>
To introduce a computed value, you simply toggle the "Computed value" option (represented by the **f(x)** icon). This will transform the chosen field into a JavaScript editor.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/computed_default_value.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>
By enabling computed values, the application provides flexibility and the ability to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/computed.gif)
### Slider example (parsing keys as integers)
The instance above showcases computed values' usage in a Slider element. JavaScript expressions are used to dynamically compute minimum and maximum values based on a value sourced from a linked input UI element (connected via the process key `${application.client.amount}`).
#### Minimum Value
```js
if ( !isNaN(parseInt(${application.client.amount})) ) {
return 0.15 * parseInt(${application.client.amount})
}  else {
return 10000
}
```
* `!isNaN(parseInt(${application.client.amount}))`: This part ascertains whether the value in the input field `(${application.client.amount})` can be effectively converted to an integer using `parseInt`. Moreover, it validates that the outcome isn't `NaN` (i.e., not a valid number), ensuring input validity.
* If the input is a valid number, the minimum value for the slider is calculated as 15% of the entered value `(0.15 * parseInt(${application.client.amount}))`.
* If the input is not a valid number `(NaN)`, the minimum value for the slider is set to 10000.
#### Maximum Value
```js
if ( !isNaN(parseInt(${application.client.amount})) ) {
return 0.35 * parseInt(${application.client.amount})
}  else {
return 20000
}
```
* Similar to the previous expression, it checks if the value entered on the input field is a valid number using `!isNaN(parseInt(${application.client.amount}))`.
* If the input is a valid number, the maximum value for the slider is calculated as 35% of the entered value `(0.35 * parseInt(${application.client.amount}))`.
* If the input is not a valid number `(NaN)`, the maximum value for the slider is set to 20000.
#### Summary
In summary, the above expressions provide a dynamic range for the slider based on the value entered on the input field. If a valid numeric value is entered, the slider's range will be dynamically adjusted between 15% and 35% of that value. If the input is not a valid number, a default range of 10000 to 20000 is set for the slider. This can be useful for scenarios where you want the slider's range to be proportional to a user-provided value.
### Text example (using computed strings)
The following scenario outlines the functionality and implementation of dynamically displayed property types via a text UI element. This is done based on the chosen loan type through a select UI element in a user interface.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/dynamic_string.gif)
#### Scenario
The UI in focus showcases two primary UI elements:
* Select Element - "Loan type": This element allows users to choose from different loan types, including "Conventional," "FHA," "VA," and "USDA."
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/loan_type.png)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/select_values.png)
</Frame>
* Text Element - "Property type": This element displays property types based on the selected loan type.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/property_type.png)
</Frame>
The following code snippet illustrates how the dynamic property types are generated based on the selected loan type (JavaScript is used):
```javascript
if ("${application.loanType}" == "conventional") {
return "Single-Family Home, Townhouse CondoMulti-Family, Dwelling";
} else if ("${application.loanType}" == "fha") {
return "Single-Family Home, Townhouse, Condo, Manufactured Home";
} else if ("${application.loanType}" == "va") {
return "Single-Family Home, Townhouse, Condo, Multi-Family Dwelling";
} else if ("${application.loanType}" == "usda") {
return "Single-Family Home, Rural Property, Farm Property";
} else {
return "Please select a loan type first";
}
```
#### Summary
* **Loan Type Selection**: Users interact with the "Loan Type Select Element" to choose a loan type, such as "Conventional," "FHA," "VA," or "USDA."
* **Property Types Display**: Once a loan type is selected, the associated property types are dynamically generated and displayed in the "Text Element."
* **Fallback Message**: If no loan type is selected or an invalid loan type is chosen, a fallback message "Please select a loan type first" is displayed.
### Integration across the UI elements
The UI Designer allows the inclusion of JavaScript expressions for generating computed values. This functionality extends to the following UI elements and their associated properties:
| Element                                | Properties                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Slider                                 | min Value, max Value, default Value |
| Input                                  | Default Value                       |
| Any UI Element that accepts validators | min, max, minLength, maxLength      |
| Text                                   | Text                                |
| Link                                   | Link Text                           |
* **Slider**: The min value, max value, and default value for sliders can be set using JavaScript expressions applied to process parameters. This allows for dynamic configuration based on numeric values.
* **Any UI Element that accepts validators min, max, minLength, maxLength**: The "params" field for these elements can also accept JavaScript expressions applied to process parameters. This enables flexibility in setting validator parameters dynamically.
* **Default Value**: For input elements like text inputs or number inputs, the default value can be a variable from the process or a computed value determined by JavaScript expressions.
* **Text**: The content of a text element can be set using JavaScript expressions, allowing for dynamic text generation or displaying process-related information.
* **Link**: The link text can also accept JavaScript expressions, enabling dynamic generation of the link text based on process parameters or other conditions.
<Tip>
When working with computed values, it's important to note that they are designed to be displayed as integers and strings.
</Tip>
<Info>
For input elements (e.g., text input), you may require a default value from a process variable, while a number input may need a computed value.

# Layout configuration
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/layout-configuration
Layout settings are available for all components that can group other types of elements (for example, Containers or Cards).
The layout configuration settings enable users to customize key properties, including layout direction, alignment, gap, sizing, and spacing, to create visually appealing and functional designs.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop width="350" height="200" center src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/grid_ov.mp4" />
</Frame>
These settings can be applied practically in various ways, depending on the context and purpose of the design:
* **Layout Direction and Alignment**: Use these settings to control how content is displayed, ensuring a logical and visually appealing arrangement. For example, a left-to-right layout direction suits languages that read from left to right, while center alignment is ideal for headings or titles.
* **Gap, Sizing, and Spacing**: Manage the distance between elements to create a sense of hierarchy and balance. Adjusting spacing between paragraphs or sections can improve readability, while resizing elements can prioritize certain components within the design.
* **Accessibility Considerations**: Customizing layout direction, alignment, spacing, and sizing can enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of your design. For example, adjusting these settings can make content more readable for users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies.
## Linear layout
The Linear layout arranges child elements in a single line, either horizontally or vertically.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/linear-layout.mp4" />

<Card title="Layout configuration" icon="link" href="https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/docs" />
## Grid layout
In addition to linear (flex-based) layouts, you can configure components using a grid layout. This option is particularly useful for designs requiring a more structured and multi-dimensional arrangement of elements.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/grid_layout.png)
</Frame>
### Switching layout types
For components that contain child elements (such as Containers, Cards, and Forms), you can easily switch between a linear layout and a Grid layout using a layout picker. The default layout is linear, but you can select Grid to arrange your content in a more structured way.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/grid_layout.mp4" />
</Frame>
### Platform-specific layouts
You can configure different layout settings for different platforms. For example, you can opt for a grid layout on the web but switch to a linear layout on mobile for a more streamlined user experience. This flexibility ensures that the design is responsive and optimized for each platform, improving usability across different devices.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/layout_platform_specific.gif)
</Frame>
#### Configuring the grid
Once the Grid layout is selected, you can define the number of columns. Initially, the columns will be distributed equally, meaning all columns will have the same width. Additional customization options include:
* **Number of Columns**: Set the number of columns for the grid. By default, grid will use two columns.
* **Alignment**: Control how child elements are aligned within the grid. Alignment can be adjusted both horizontally and vertically, ensuring that content is positioned exactly where needed.
* **Gap Configuration**: Customize the gap between columns and rows. The default gap is inherited from the parent component's theme settings, ensuring consistency across your design.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/grid_specs.png)
</Frame>
#### Grid child settings
When configuring a grid, individual child components can be further customized:
* **Column Span**: Set how many columns a child component should span across.
<Warning>
Col Span should not exceed the number of parent grid columns.
</Warning>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/grid_layout_child_settings.gif)
</Frame>
* **Row Span (Web Only)**: Set how many rows a child component should span.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/grid_layout_child_settings1.gif)
</Frame>
#### Order property
The Order property controls the arrangement of elements within grid layouts. By default, elements follow the order in which they appear in the parent component's array. However, this order can be customized using the following options:
* **Auto**: The default setting that retains the order of elements as defined in the array (default value is `0`).
* **First**: Moves the element to the first position by setting its order to `-999`.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/order_first.gif)
</Frame>
* **Last**: Moves the element to the last position by setting its order to `999`.
* **Manual**: Allows for custom ordering by setting a specific numerical value.
<Tip>
Example: In a Grid with 10 elements, setting one element's order to `5` while the others are set to `auto` (which equals `0`) will place that element last, because `5` is greater than `0`.
</Tip>
#### Alignment in grid layouts
Proper alignment within grid layouts is essential, particularly when working with fixed-width columns or rows. By default, child elements will inherit alignment settings from their parent component, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
However, you have the flexibility to override these default settings for individual child elements, allowing precise control over horizontal and vertical alignment. This customization is key to achieving the desired visual structure, especially when certain elements need specific positioning within the grid.
### Component details

### Best Practices
To ensure an optimal user experience and consistent visual design, consider these best practices when using grid layouts:
* **Minimize Fixed Widths**: Avoid using fixed widths for child components in a grid. Relying on flexible sizing allows the grid to adapt smoothly across different screen sizes and devices. Only use fixed widths when absolutely necessary (e.g., for icons or buttons with defined sizes).
* **Consider Total Width**: If you know the width of the screen is `X`, ensure that the total width of your fixed-width elements doesn't exceed `X`. This prevents layout issues like content overflow or misalignment across different devices.
* **Use Column Span Thoughtfully**: When setting the `columnSpan` for a grid child, ensure that the total spans across all elements do not exceed the number of columns. This ensures a consistent and predictable layout.
* **Avoid Overcrowding**: When adding numerous child components to a grid, be mindful of spacing (gaps) between elements. Proper use of `rowGap` and `columnGap` helps maintain clarity and reduces visual clutter.
* **Leverage Default Inheritance**: Utilize the default alignment inheritance from the parent grid to ensure consistency. Only override alignment on child components when specific visual differences are needed.
* **Use `Auto` Order When Possible**: Stick with the `auto` order setting for most child components, unless a specific element needs to appear first or last. This will help maintain logical reading and visual flow without complex manual ordering.
* **Always Be Mindful of Mobile Screen Width**: When designing for mobile, always consider the narrower screen width. Ensure that grid layouts adapt gracefully, perhaps switching from a grid to a linear layout, or adjusting spacing and sizing to fit within the mobile screen's constraints without causing overflow or misalignment.
* **Test Across Platforms**: Given potential differences in behavior between web, iOS, and Android platforms, test your grid layout across these platforms to ensure consistent performance and avoid unexpected behavior like overflow or misalignment.
* **Avoid Fixed Widths on Columns**: Instead of setting fixed widths on the entire column, apply fixed widths to the individual elements inside the grid cells. This ensures more flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices, without causing issues like overflow or misalignment.
### FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion
title="I have a Grid with 10 elements, and I set one element's order to `5`. Why is it not displayed as the fifth element?
"
>
**A:** The order property works relative to other elements. If other elements are set to `auto` (which equals `0`), then the element with order `5` will be placed after all the `0` elements, making it appear last.

# Localization and internationalization
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/localization-and-i18n
FlowX localization and internationalization adapt applications to different languages, regions, and formats, enhancing the user experience with dynamic date, number and currency formatting.
<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/l10_i18n.mp4" />
## Internationalization
Internationalization (i18n) in FlowX enables applications to be easily adapted for multiple languages and regions without altering the core code. It sets the foundation for localization by handling language structure, layout adjustments, and supporting various formats.
<Tip>
To set the default language at the application level, navigate to **Projects -> Application -> Settings**.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/application_language.png)
</Tip>
## Localization
Locale settings impact all date, number, and currency formats based on the combination of region and language. The language dictates translations, while the region specifies formatting order and conventions.
### Locale sources
Locale settings are derived from two main sources:
* **Container Application**: Provides global locale settings across the application.
<Info>
If not specified during deployment, the default locale will be set to `en-US`.
</Info>
* **Application Level**: Enables context-specific overrides within the application for formatting Numbers, Dates, and Currencies.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/app_lvl_format.png)
</Frame>
## Core i18n & l10n features
### Date formats
The default date format in FlowX is automatically determined by the default locale set at the application or system level. Each locale follows its region-specific date convention.
For example:
* en-US locale (United States): `MM/DD/YYYY` → 09/28/2024
<Tip>
You can set date formats at the application level (as you can see in the example above), choosing from five predefined options: short, medium, long, full, or custom (e.g., dd/mm/yy).
Additionally, date formats can be overridden at the UI Designer level for specific UI elements that support date customization.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/override_custom.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>
UI Elements supporting date formats:
* Text
* Link
* Message
* Datepicker
FlowX will apply the following formatting options, adapting to the region's standard conventions:
| Format Type | Format Pattern        | Example                        | Description                                |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Short**   | `MM/dd/yy`            | `08/28/24`                     | Month before day, two-digit year.          |
| **Medium**  | `MMM dd, yyyy`        | `Sep 28, 2024`                 | Abbreviated month, day, four-digit year.   |
| **Long**    | `MMMM dd, yyyy`       | `September 28, 2024`           | Full month name, day, and four-digit year. |
| **Full**    | `EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy` | `Thursday, September 28, 2024` | Full day of the week, month, day, year.    |
| **Custom**  | `dd/MM/yyyy`          | `28/08/2024`                   | User-defined format; day before month.     |
<Info>
The date formats shown in the example are based on the **en-US (United States English) locale**, which typically uses the month-day-year order.
</Info>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/date_formats.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
If the predefined date formats do not met your needs you can declare and use a custom date format (both at application level or override in UI Designer).
</Tip>
The following example will demonstrate how to set and display various date formats using text UI elements. We will override the default format (originating from the application level) directly in the UI Designer to showcase all available formats:
<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/example_formatting.mp4" />
<Info>
FlowX formats dates using [**ISO 8601**](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) for consistent and clear international representation.

### Number formatting
FlowX adjusts number formats to align with regional standards, including the use of appropriate decimal separators and digit grouping symbols. This ensures that numbers are displayed in a familiar format for users based on their locale.
#### Locale-specific formatting
Formatting the numbers to adapt decimal separators (`comma` vs. `dot`) and digit grouping (`1,000` vs. `1.000`) to match regional conventions.
<Tip>
The correct formatting for a number depends on the locale. Here's a quick look at how the same number might be formatted differently in various regions:
* **en-US (United States)**: 1,234.56 (comma for digit grouping, dot for decimals)
* **de-DE (Germany)**: 1.234,56 (dot for digit grouping, comma for decimals)
* **fr-FR (France)**: 1 234,56 (space for digit grouping, comma for decimals)
* **es-ES (Spain)**: 1.234,56 (dot for digit grouping, comma for decimals)
</Tip>
#### Decimal precision
You can set minimum and maximum decimal places for numbers in application settings to store data and display it with the required precision in the data store.

</Frame>
<Info>
Formatting settings defined in the FlowX props in the UI Designer take precedence over the application-level formatting settings.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/min_max_decimals.png)
</Frame>
</Info>
<Tip>
For UI elements that support `number` or `currency` types, FlowX checks the data model for precision settings and applies them during data storage, ensuring consistency to configured precision levels.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/darta_model_precision.png)
This means that when using a `float` data model attribute, the precision settings directly control how the number is saved in the data store, specifying the maximum number of decimal places that can be stored.
<Info>
Additionally, an for input UI elements a mask is applied to prevent users from entering more decimal places than the precision set, ensuring data integrity and compliance with defined formatting rules.
</Info>
For more details, refer to [Data model integration](#data-model-integration).
</Tip>
* **Minimum Decimals**: Sets the least number of decimal places that a number will display. If a number has fewer than the specified decimals, trailing zeros will be added to meet the requirement.
* **Maximum Decimals**: Limits the number of decimal places a number can have. If the number exceeds this limit, it will be rounded to the specified number of decimals.
**Example**:
If you set both Minimum and Maximum Decimals to 3, a number like 2 would display as 2.000, and 3.14159 would be 3.141.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/min_max_decimals_ex.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
At runtime, the system applies number formatting rules based on the locale and the settings defined in the application's configuration or UI Designer overrides.
If the number is linked to a data model key the formatting adheres to the metadata defined there, ensuring consistent rendering of numerical data.
</Info>
### Currency formatting
FlowX provides currency formatting features that dynamically adapt to regional settings, ensuring accurate representation of financial data.
#### Currency object structure
Currencies are managed as a system object with `amount` and `code` keys, creating a wrapper that facilitates consistent handling. This design ensures that every currency display corresponds accurately to the regional and formatting standards defined by the locale. If the `code` is not provided, the system uses the locale to determine the appropriate currency symbol or code.
#### Display behavior
When displaying currency values, the system expects keys like `loanAmount` to have both `amount` and `code` properties. For example, with the locale set to `en-US`, the output will automatically follow the US formatting conventions, displaying amounts like "\$12,000.78" when the currency is USD.
* If the value found at the key path is not an object containing `amount` or `code`, the system will display the value as-is if it is primitive. If it's an object, it will show an empty string.
* If the key path is not defined, similar behavior applies: primitive values are displayed as-is, and objects result in an empty string.
#### Locale-sensitive formatting
Currency formatting depends primarily on the region defined by the locale, not the language.
<Info>
When the currency `code` is `null`, the system defaults to the currency settings embedded within the locale, ensuring region-specific accuracy.
</Info>
#### Dynamic formatting in UI
FlowX dynamically applies number formatting within UI components, such as inputs and sliders. These components adjust in real-time based on the current locale, ensuring that users always see numbers in their preferred format. UI components that support currency values dynamically format them in real time. For example:
* Input fields with `CURRENCY` types save values in `{key path}.amount` and will delete the entry from the data store if the input is empty.
* Sliders will save integer values (with no decimals) to `{key path}.amount` and format the displayed values, including min/max labels, according to the locale and currency.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/slider_min_max.gif)
</Frame>
**Formatting Text with locale and data from UI elements**
This example demonstrates how to format a dynamic text by substituting placeholders with values from a data store, taking into account locale-specific formatting. In this case, the goal is to insert the value  coming from a key called loanAmount (added on an Input UI element) into a text and format it according to the en-US locale.
**Data store**:
A JSON object containing key-value pairs. The `loanAmount` key holds a currency object with two properties:
* amount: The actual loan value (a float or number).
* code: The currency code in ISO format (e.g., "USD" for US Dollars).
```json{
"loanAmount": {
"amount": 12000.78,
"code": "USD"
}
}
```
**Locale**
The locale determines the number and currency formatting rules, such as the use of commas, periods, and currency symbols.
Locale: en-US (English - United States)
**Processing**
* Step 1: The platform extracts the loanAmount.amount value (12000.78) and the loanAmount.code from the data store.
* Step 2: Format the amount according to the specified locale (en-US). In this locale:
* Use a comma , to separate thousands.
* Use a period . to denote decimal places.
* Step 3: Replace the `${loanAmount}` placeholder in the text with the formatted value \$12,000.78.
**Output**
The resulting text with the formatted loan amount and the appropriate currency symbol for the en-US locale.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/loanAmount.gif)
</Frame>
Here is the data extracted from the data store (it is available on the process instance)
<Tip>
For instance, with a Romanian locale (`ro-RO`), currency is displayed like "12.000,78 RON" when the `code` is null or unavailable.
</Tip>
## Data model integration
FlowX integrates number formatting directly with the data model. When keys are set to number or currency types, the system automatically checks and applies precision settings during data storage. This approach ensures consistency across different data sources and UI components.
Integration Details:
* Numbers are broken down into integer and decimal parts, stored according to specified precision.
* Currency keys are managed as wrapper objects containing amount and code, formatted according to the locale settings.
## UI Designer integration
Formatting is dependent on the locale, which includes both language and region settings. The application container provides the locale for display formatting.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/locale_language_ui_designer.png)
</Frame>
Formatting settings (which is by default `auto`) can be switched to `manual` and overridden for text, message, and link components within the UI Designer's properties tab.
<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/l10n_i18n_ui_designer.mp4" />
The UI Designer enables application-level formatting settings for localized display of dynamic values.
## Supported components
* **Text/Message/Link**: Override general localization settings to match localized content presentation.
* **Input Fields**: Inputs correctly format currency and number types based on regional settings.
* **Sliders**: Currency formatting for sliders, with suffixes disabled when currency types are detected.
* **Datepickers**: Date formatting
# UI actions
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-actions
UI actions bridge the gap between multiple UI elements and specific actions, dictating how the interface responds to user interactions. They control behaviors such as displaying loaders, dismissing modals, or sending default data back to a process, enabling interaction between UI components and underlying logic.
## Overview
UI actions establish connections between [**UI components**](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom) or custom elements and predefined [**actions**](../actions/actions). These connections ensure that processes are executed efficiently while defining the UI's response. Examples include:
* Showing a loader during an action execution.
* Automatically dismissing a modal after a task is completed.
* Sending default data back to the process.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/ui-actions.mp4" />
</Frame>
***
## Types of UI actions
UI actions can be categorized into two main types:
1. **Process UI Actions**: Directly interact with process nodes and manual actions.
2. **External UI Actions**: Perform actions that link to external URLs or open new tabs.
***
### Process UI actions
Process UI Actions (labeled `ACTION`) define how a [**Button**](../ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), whether generated or custom, interacts with a manual process action. Before configuring a UI action, ensure the corresponding [manual action](../actions/actions) is set up.
#### Adding a node action
To configure a UI action, first add a node action (type: manual) to a process node. For detailed steps, refer to:
<Card title="Adding an action to a node" href="../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node" icon="file" />
**Example: Configuring a node action (Save Data)**
1. **Add an Action**: Attach an action to a node.
2. **Select the Action Type**: Choose **Save Data**, for instance.
3. **Action Type**: Set it to **manual**.
<Frame>

</Frame>
<Check>
Both UI actions and [node actions](../actions/actions) must be configured on the same user task node.
</Check>
### Configuring a UI action
Below are the key configuration options for defining a UI action:
* **Event**: Define when the action should trigger ([Learn about Events](#events)).
* **Action Type**: Specify the type of action ([Explore Action Types](#action-types)).
* **Node Action Name**: Select the corresponding manual action from the dropdown.
* **Use a different name for UI action**: Optionally, define a unique name to trigger the action in [**Custom Components**](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom).
* **Add custom keys**: Add custom keys beyond those in the data model.
* **Exclude keys**: Specify data keys to exclude.
* **Add custom body**: Provide a default JSON response, merged with additional parameters during execution.
* **Add form to submit**: Link the action to specific UI elements for validation.
* **Hide Subprocess Navigation**: Disable navigation to subprocesses.
* **Show loader**: Display a loader until a server-side event (SSE) updates the data or screen.
<Frame>

</Frame>
## UI actions elements
### Events
Events define how user interactions trigger UI actions. The available event types are:
* **CLICK**: Triggered when a button is clicked.
* **CHANGE**: Triggered when input fields are modified.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/ui_actions.mp4" />
</Frame>
<Info>
Events are not applicable for UI actions on [Custom Components](./ui-component-types/root-components/custom).
</Info>
***
### Action types
The **Action Type** dropdown includes several predefined options:
* **DISMISS**: Closes a modal after the action is executed.
* **ACTION**: Links a UI action to a manual node action.
* **START\_PROJECT**:  Initiates a new project instance. This action type is used to trigger a completely new process flow within a different project or application, based on the selected project and process configurations.
* **UPLOAD**: Initiates an upload action.
* **EXTERNAL**: Opens a link in a new browser tab or window.
***
## External UI actions
**External UI Actions** enable linking to external URLs and opening links in a new tab or the same tab.
When configuring an external UI action, additional options become available:
1. **URL**: Specify the web URL for the action.
2. **Open in New Tab**: Choose whether to execute the action in the current tab or a new tab.

# Collection component
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection
The Collection component functions as a versatile container element, allowing you to iterate through a list of elements and display them according to their specific configurations.
## Configurable properties
* `collectionSource`: This property specifies the process key where a list can be found. It should be a valid array of objects.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/collection_source_key1.png)
</Frame>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/%20collection_source_key.png)
</Frame>
## Example usage
Here's an example of configuring a Collection component to display a list of products:
<Frame>
![Collection configuration for displaying employees](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/collection_example.png)
</Frame>
Source collection data example using an [**MVEL business rule**](../../../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action):
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/collection_mvel.png)
</Frame>
```java
output.put("processData", //this is the key
{
"products": [ // this is the source that will populate the data on collection
{
"name": "Product One Plus",
"description": "The plus option",
"type": "normal"
},
{
"name": "Product Two Premium",
"description": "This is premium product",
"type": "recommended"
},
{
"name": "Product Basic",
"description": "The most basic option",
"type": "normal"
},
{
"name": "Gold Product",
"description": "The gold option",
"type": "normal"
}
]
}
);
```
The above configuration will render the Collection as shown below:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/render_collection.gif)
<Info>
Components within a collection use **relative paths** to the collection source. This means that wherever the collection is found inside the process data, the components inside the collection need their keys configured relative to that collection.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/collection_relative_key.png)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/collection_key_rule.png)
</Info>
<Warning>
To send and display dynamic data received on the keys you define to the frontend, make sure to include the following data structure in your root UI element using Message parameters. For instance, if you want to include data for the `processData` key mentioned earlier, your configuration should resemble this:
```json
{
"processData": ${processData}
}
```
</Warning>
<Tip>
To enable the definition of multiple prototypes for a single Collection and display elements from the same collection differently, an additional container known as a *collection prototype* is required. For more information on collection prototypes, please refer to the next section:
</Tip>
<Card title="Collection prototype" href="/4.0/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection_prototype" icon="link" />
# Collection Prototype
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/collection-prototype
Create dynamic, data-driven interfaces with different layouts based on item properties using collection prototypes.
<Note>
Collection prototypes allow you to display items within a collection using different layouts based on their properties, creating more dynamic and context-aware user interfaces.
</Note>
## What are Collection Prototypes?
Collection prototypes are specialized components that define different display formats for items within a single collection. They act as templates that are applied conditionally based on item properties, allowing you to:
* Display collection items with different layouts based on their data properties
* Create visually distinct displays for featured or highlighted items
* Apply specialized formatting for different item types or states
* Integrate custom components for enhanced functionality
* Add interactive features like item selection
<Info>
Collection prototypes always work as child components within a parent [Collection component](../collection). While a Collection iterates through a data array, Collection Prototypes determine how each individual item should be displayed.
</Info>
## How Collection Prototypes Work
### Core Concepts
Collection prototypes use a simple but powerful mechanism to determine which layout to apply to each item:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Prototype Identifier Key" icon="key">
The data property used to determine which prototype to apply (e.g., `type`, `status`, `priority`)
</Card>
<Card title="Prototype Identifier Value" icon="tag">
The specific value that triggers this prototype layout (e.g., `featured`, `active`, `high`)
</Card>
</CardGroup>
When the collection renders, each item is evaluated against all available prototypes. The first prototype whose identifier key and value match the item's data is used to render that item.
### Visual Example
Here's how collection prototypes can display products with different layouts based on their `type` property:

## Implementation Guide
### 1. Prepare Your Data
Before implementing collection prototypes, you need to prepare the data structure that will determine which prototype applies to each item.
#### Using a Service Task Node
The most common approach is to use a Service Task node with business rules:
<Steps>
<Step title="Add a Service Task Node">
In the FlowX.AI Designer, add a **Service Task** node before your User Task node and connect them with a sequence flow.
<Frame caption="Adding a Service Task node">
![Adding a Service Task node to your process](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/task_node_array.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Configure the Business Rule">
Select your Service Task node, go to the **Business Rules** tab, and add a new business rule or edit an existing one.
<Frame caption="Configuring a business rule">
![Configuring a business rule in a Service Task node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/prepare_array_of_products.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Write the Data Preparation Code">
Use JavaScript to create your data structure and assign it to the process context:
```javascript
// Create the data structure for products
const products = [
{
"name": "Product One Plus",
"description": "The plus option",
"type": "normal",  // This property will determine which prototype to use
"price": 99.99
},
{
"name": "Product Two Premium",
"description": "This is premium product",
"type": "recommended",  // This will use a different prototype
"price": 149.99
},
{
"name": "Product Basic",
"description": "The most basic option",
"type": "normal",
"price": 49.99
}
];
// Add the products array to the process data
output.put("products", products);
```
</Step>
<Step title="Test Your Data">
Save your configuration, and test your business rule by using the **Test Rule** feature in the business rules editor to make sure the data is correctly added to the process context.
<Frame caption="Verifying business rule output">
![Verifying business rule output](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/test_your_data.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
### 2. Create the UI Components
Once your data is prepared, you can implement the collection and its prototypes in the UI Designer:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a User Task Node">
In the FlowX.AI Designer, create or select an existing **User Task** node in your process and click the **brush icon** to open the UI Designer.
<Frame caption="Opening the UI Designer for a User Task node">
![Opening the UI Designer from a User Task node](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/add_user_task_node_for_collection.gif)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Add a Collection Component">
Add a **root component** (like a Card or Container) to your node, then add a **Collection** component inside it. Configure the Collection's **source** to point to your data array (e.g., `products`).
<Frame caption="Adding a Collection component">
![Adding a Collection component in the UI Designer](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/collection_prototype_source.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
The `collectionSource` property specifies the process key where your list can be found. It should be a valid array of objects. For example, if your data is at `processData.products`, you would set the source to `products`.
</Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Add Collection Prototypes">
For each different display type:
1. Click on your Collection component to select it
2. Add a **Collection Prototype** as a child component
3. Configure the prototype's settings:
* **Prototype Identifier Key**: The field to check (e.g., `type`)
* **Prototype Identifier Value**: The value to match (e.g., `normal`)
<Frame caption="Configuring a Collection Prototype">
![Configuring a Collection Prototype in the UI Designer](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/collection_prototype_source1.png)
</Frame>
4. (If different prototypes identifier values are needed) Repeat for each different prototype you need, using different identifier values
</Step>
<Step title="Design Each Prototype's Layout">
For each prototype, add the UI components that will display your data:
1. Select a Collection Prototype
2. Add components like **Text**, **Image**, **Button**, etc.
3. Configure each component to use relative paths to the collection item data saved in the Data Model:
* Use text UI element with the key `${name}`
* Use text UI element with the key `${description}`
<Frame caption="Adding components to a prototype">
![Adding components to a Collection Prototype](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/collection_prototype_elements.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
Components within a collection use **relative paths** to the collection source. This means that wherever the collection is found inside the process data, the components inside the collection need their keys configured relative to that collection.

### 3. Add Interactivity
To make your collection items interactive, such as allowing users to select an item:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Node Action">
Add an [Action](../../../actions/actions) to your [User task node](../../../node/user-task-node):
1. Go back to the process designer
2. Select your User Task node
3. Go to the **Actions** tab
4. Add a new action with:
* Type: **Manual**
* Name: (e.g., `selectItem`)
<Frame caption="Adding a Node Action">
![Configuration screen for node action setup](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/add_interactivity.png)
</Frame>
**Configuration options:**
* Set as **Manual** since users trigger it
* Mark as **Mandatory** if selection is required to proceed
* Enable **Repeatable** for changeable selections
</Step>
<Step title="Configure a UI Action">
Add a UI action to your collection prototype:
1. Return to the UI Designer
2. Select the component in your prototype that should trigger the action
3. In the Settings panel, add a UI Action
4. Add a  **Collection Item Save Key**.
5. Add a **Custom Key** and make sure it matches the **Collection Item Save Key**.
<Frame caption="Adding a UI Action">

## Best Practices
### Working with Custom Components
<Check>
When integrating custom components into collection prototypes, follow these best practices:
</Check>
1. **Use relative paths for data access**
* Configure input keys relative to collection items
* Example: Use `name` instead of `app.clients.name`
2. **Maintain consistent data structures**
* Ensure required data exists in collection items
* Follow consistent data patterns across all items
### Data Access Patterns
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Outside collections">
Components use full paths from data root:
```jsx
// Input keys:
// app.name
// app.signatureImageURL
data: {
app: {
name: "John Doe",
signatureImageURL: "http://example.com/signature1.png"
}
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Inside collections">
Components use relative paths:
```jsx
// Input keys:
// name
// signatureImageURL
data: {
name: "John Doe",
signatureImageURL: "http://example.com/signature1.png"
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
### Performance Optimization
* Limit the number of items in your collection when possible
* Simplify complex prototype layouts
* Consider pagination for large data sets
* Optimize images and other media within prototypes
* Avoid deeply nested components within prototypes
<Check>
**Pro tips:**
* Test your collection prototypes with various data scenarios
* Verify data flow through the entire selection process
* Monitor the process data for correct updates
* Ensure your UI provides clear visual feedback when an item is selected
</Check>
## Troubleshooting
When working with collection prototypes, you might encounter some common issues:
### Common Issues and Solutions
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Prototype not displaying correctly">
**Symptoms:**
* Collection items appear with incorrect layouts
* All items use the same prototype regardless of identifier values
* Some items don't render at all
**Solutions:**
* Verify that your **Prototype Identifier Key** exactly matches the property name in your data
* Ensure the **Prototype Identifier Value** matches the expected values in your data
* Check for case sensitivity issues in both keys and values
* Validate your data structure using the process debugger
* Confirm that the parent Collection component has the correct source path
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI actions not working">
**Symptoms:**
* Clicking on items doesn't trigger the expected action
* Selected data isn't saved to the process
* No visual feedback when items are selected
**Solutions:**
* Confirm that the **Collection Item Save Key** matches exactly with the **Data to send** field in your node action
* Verify that your node action is properly configured as **Manual** and **Repeatable** if needed
* Check that the UI action is attached to the correct element within the prototype
* Ensure the node action has the correct permissions and is properly linked
* Verify that your root UI element includes the necessary Message parameters to pass data
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data binding issues">
**Symptoms:**
* Components inside prototypes show empty or incorrect data
* Dynamic content doesn't update properly
* Error messages in the console related to undefined properties
**Solutions:**
* Remember that components inside collections must use relative paths (e.g., `name` instead of `app.clients.name`)
* Verify your data structure matches what the components expect
* Use the process debugger to inspect the actual data being passed to the collection
* Check for null or undefined values that might cause rendering issues
* Ensure your data is properly structured as an array of objects
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
### Known Limitations
<Warning>
* **Nested collections** (collections inside collection prototypes) may cause performance issues and should be used sparingly
* **Deep data structures** might require careful handling of relative paths for proper data binding
</Warning>
### Debugging Tips
1. **Use process data inspection:**
* Monitor the process data before and after interactions with collection prototypes
* Verify that selected items are correctly saved to the expected process data keys
2. **Test with simplified data:**
* Start with a minimal data set to confirm basic functionality
* Gradually add complexity to identify where issues might occur
3. **Isolate components:**
* Test individual UI components outside the collection context
* Add components to prototypes one by one to identify problematic elements
## Frequently Asked Questions
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I use different layouts for mobile and desktop?">
Yes, you can create platform-specific overrides for your collection prototypes. Configure different layouts, spacing, and styling for Web, iOS, and Android platforms through the platform tabs in the UI Designer.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I handle missing identifier values?">
If an item doesn't have the specified identifier key or value, it won't match any prototype. Consider adding a default prototype with a common value like "default" and ensure all items have at least this value as a fallback.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use expressions in prototype identifier values?">
No, prototype identifier values must be static strings that exactly match the values in your data. However, you can transform your data before it reaches the collection to achieve dynamic prototype selection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many prototypes I can define?">
There's no hard limit on the number of prototypes, but for performance and maintainability reasons, it's recommended to keep the number reasonable (typically under 5-7 different prototypes).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between Collection and Collection Prototype?">
A **Collection** is a container that iterates through an array of data items, while a **Collection Prototype** defines how each individual item should be displayed based on its properties. You need at least one Collection Prototype inside a Collection, but you can have multiple prototypes to handle different item types or states.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## Code Examples
### Different Prototype Layouts Based on Item Status
This example shows how to display items differently based on their status (active, pending, completed):
<CodeGroup>
```java Process Data Setup
// Setting up process data with items of different statuses
output.put("processData", {
"tasks": [
{
"id": "task-001",
"title": "Review application",
"description": "Initial review of customer application",
"status": "active",
"priority": "high"
},
{
"id": "task-002",
"title": "Verify documents",
"description": "Check submitted documentation for completeness",
"status": "pending",
"priority": "medium"
},
{
"id": "task-003",
"title": "Send confirmation",
"description": "Email confirmation to customer",
"status": "completed",
"priority": "low"
}
]
});
```
```javascript Collection Configuration
// Collection component configuration
{
"type": "COLLECTION",
"settings": {
"source": "tasks",
"direction": "vertical"
},
"children": [
// Active task prototype
{
"type": "COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE",
"settings": {
"prototypeIdentifierKey": "status",
"prototypeIdentifierValue": "active"
},
"children": [
// Active task UI elements with highlighted styling
]
},
// Pending task prototype
{
"type": "COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE",
"settings": {
"prototypeIdentifierKey": "status",
"prototypeIdentifierValue": "pending"
},
"children": [
// Pending task UI elements with standard styling
]
},
// Completed task prototype
{
"type": "COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE",
"settings": {
"prototypeIdentifierKey": "status",
"prototypeIdentifierValue": "completed"
},
"children": [
// Completed task UI elements with muted styling
]
}
]
}
```
</CodeGroup>
### Multiple Identifier Keys for Complex Conditions
You can use multiple collection prototypes with different identifier keys to handle complex display logic:
<CodeGroup>
```java Process Data with Multiple Attributes
// Setting up process data with items having multiple attributes
output.put("processData", {
"notifications": [
{
"id": "notif-001",
"message": "Your application has been approved",
"type": "success",
"priority": "high",
"read": false
},
{
"id": "notif-002",
"message": "Please review updated terms",
"type": "info",
"priority": "low",
"read": true
},
{
"id": "notif-003",
"message": "Action required: Missing information",
"type": "warning",
"priority": "high",
"read": false
}
]
});
```
```javascript Multiple Prototype Configuration
// Collection with multiple prototype conditions
{
"type": "COLLECTION",
"settings": {
"source": "notifications",
"direction": "vertical"
},
"children": [
// High priority unread success notification
{
"type": "COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE",
"settings": {
"prototypeIdentifierKey": "type",
"prototypeIdentifierValue": "success",
"additionalConditions": [
{
"key": "priority",
"value": "high"
},
{
"key": "read",
"value": false
}
]
},
"children": [
// UI elements for high priority unread success notifications
]
},
// Other prototypes for different combinations...
]
}
```
</CodeGroup>
### Nested Data Structures
Working with nested data in collection prototypes:
<CodeGroup>
```java Nested Data Structure
// Setting up process data with nested objects
output.put("processData", {
"orders": [
{
"id": "order-001",
"customer": {
"name": "John Smith",
"tier": "premium"
},
"items": [
{ "name": "Product A", "quantity": 2 },
{ "name": "Product B", "quantity": 1 }
],
"status": "processing"
},
{
"id": "order-002",
"customer": {
"name": "Jane Doe",
"tier": "standard"
},
"items": [
{ "name": "Product C", "quantity": 3 }
],
"status": "shipped"
}
]
});
```
```javascript Accessing Nested Data
// Collection prototype accessing nested data
{
"type": "COLLECTION",
"settings": {
"source": "orders",
"direction": "vertical"
},
"children": [
// Premium customer prototype
{
"type": "COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE",
"settings": {
"prototypeIdentifierKey": "customer.tier",
"prototypeIdentifierValue": "premium"
},
"children": [
// UI elements for premium customers
{
"type": "TEXT",
"settings": {
"text": "Premium Customer",
"style": "heading"
}
},
{
"type": "TEXT",
"settings": {
"text": "${customer.name}",
"style": "subheading"
}
},
// Collection for order items
{
"type": "COLLECTION",
"settings": {
"source": "items",
"direction": "horizontal"
},
"children": [
// Item prototype
{
"type": "COLLECTION_PROTOTYPE",
"settings": {},
"children": [
{
"type": "TEXT",
"settings": {
"text": "${name} (${quantity})",
"style": "body"
}
}
]
}

# Checkbox
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/checkbox-form-field
A checkbox form field is an interactive element in a web form that provides users with multiple selectable options. It allows users to choose one or more options from a pre-determined set by simply checking the corresponding checkboxes.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/checkbox_new.png)
</Frame>
This type of form field can be used to gather information such as interests, preferences, or approvals, and it provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with a form.
## Configuring the Checkbox element
### Checkbox generic settings
The available configuration options for this form element are:
* [**Process data key**](#process-data-key)
* [**Properties**](#properties)
* [**Datasource**](#datasource)
* [**Validators**](#validators)
* [**Expressions**](#expressions)
* [**UI actions**](#ui-actions)
* [**Checkbox styling**](#checkbox-styling)
#### Process data key
Process data key establishes the binding between the checkbox element and process data, enabling its later use in [decisions](../../../node/exclusive-gateway-node), [business rules](../../../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) or [integrations](../../../node/message-send-received-task-node#from-integration).
#### Properties
* **Label**: The visible label for the checkbox.
* **Helpertext**: Additional information about the checkbox element, which can be optionally hidden within an infopoint.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/checkbox_validators.png)
</Frame>
#### Hide/disable expressions
The checkbox behavior can be defined using JavaScript expressions for hiding or disabling the element. The following properties can be configured for expressions:
* **Hide condition**: A JavaScript expression that hides the checkbox element when it evaluates to the specified result.
* **Disabled condition**: A JavaScript expression that disables the checkbox when it returns a truthy value.
These expressions can be used with any form element. See the following example for details:
<Card title="Input hide/disabled example" href="./input-form-field#hidedisable-expressions" />
<Info>
It's important to make sure that disabled fields have the same expression configured under the path expressions → hide.
</Info>
#### UI actions
UI actions can be added to the checkbox element to define its behavior and interactions.
* **Event**: Possible value - `CHANGE`.
* **Action Type**: Select the type of the action to be performed.
<Info>
For more details on how to configure a UI action, click [**here**](../../ui-actions).
</Info>
### Checkbox settings overrides
There are instances where you may need to tailor settings configured in the **Generic** settings tab. This proves especially beneficial when you wish to adjust these settings to appear differently across various platforms such as Web, Android, or iOS.
Available override settings:
* Properties:
* **Label**: Override the checkbox label.
* **Helper**: Override helper text/info point.
* Expressions:
* **Hide**: Override the hide expression.
<Tip>
Overrides can always be imported/pushed from one platform to another:

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/input_datasource2.png)
</Frame>
#### Computed datasource value
To add a computed value, you have to explicitly check “Computed value” option (represented by the `f(x)` icon), which will transform the desired field into a JavaScript editor.
Check the following example:
<Card title="Computed values" href="../../dynamic-and-computed-values#computed-values" icon="link" />
#### Validators
Incorporating validators into your inputs adds an extra layer of assurance to your data. (For further insights, refer to [this link](../../validators)).
Witness the essential role of validators in action with this required validator example:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/Input_validat.gif)

## Example - dynamic dropdowns
As mentioned previously, you can create dropdowns including static data, enumerations, or **process data**. Let's create an example using **process data** to create a process that contains **dynamic dropdowns**.
To create this kind of process, we need the following elements:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_dropdowns.gif)
</Frame>
* a [**task node**](../../../node/task-node) (this will be used to set which data will be displayed on the dropdowns - by adding a business rule on the node)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_dropdowns1.gif)
</Frame>
* a [**user task node**](../../../node/user-task-node) (here we have the client forms and here we add the SELECT elements)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_dropwdowns2.gif)
</Frame>
### Creating the process
Follow the next steps to create the process from scratch:
1. Open **FlowX Designer** and from the **Processes** tab select **Definitions**.
2. Click on the breadcrumbs (top-right corner) then click **New process** (the Process Designer will now open).
3. Now add all the **necessary nodes** (as mentioned above).
### Configuring the nodes
1. On the **task node**, add a new **Action** (this will set the data for the dropdowns) with the following properties:
* Action type - **Business Rule**
* **Automatic**
* **Mandatory**
* **Language** (we used an [**MVEL**](../../../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel) script to create a list of objects)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_business_rukle.png)
</Frame>
Below you can find the MVEL script used in the above example:
```java
output.put("application",
{
"client": {
"identity": [
{
"value": "001",
"label": "Eddard Stark"
},
{
"value": "002",
"label": "Sansa Stark"
},
{
"value": "003",
"label": "Catelyn Stark"
}
]},
"contracts": {
"001": [
{
"value": "c001",
"label": "Eddard Contract 1"
},
{
"value": "c007",
"label": "Eddard Contract 2"
}
],
"003": [
{
"value": "c002",
"label": "Catelyn Contract 1",
},
{
"value": "c003",
"label": "Catelyn Contract 2 ",
},
{
"value": "c004",
"label": "Catelyn Contract 3"
}
],
"002": [
{
"value": "c005",
"label": "Sansa Contract 1",
}
]
}
});
```
2. On the **user task node**, add a new **Action** (submit action, this will validate the forms and save the date) with the following properties:
* **Action type** - Save Data
* **Manual**
* **Mandatory**
* **Data to send** (the key on which we added client details and contracts as objects in the business rule) - `application`
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/d_action_ut.png)
</Frame>
### Configuring the UI
Follow the next steps to configure the UI needed:
1. Select the **user task node** and click the **brush icon** to open [**UI Designer**](../../ui-designer).
2. Add a [**Card**](../root-components/card) UI element as a [**root component**](../root-components/) (this will group the other elements inside it) with the following properties:
* Generic:
* **Custom UI payload** - `{"application": ${application}}` - so the frontend will know which data to display dynamically when selecting values from the **SELECT** element
* **Title** - *Customer Contract*
3. Inside the **card**, add a [**form element**](./).
4. Inside the **form** add two **select elements**, first will represent, for example, the *Customer Name* and the second the *Contract ID.*
5. For first select element (Customer Name) set the following properties:
* **Process data key** - `application.client.selectedClient`
* **Label** - Customer Name
* **Placeholder** - Customer Name
* **Source type** - Process Data (to extract the data added in the **task node**)
* **Name** - `application.client.identity`
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/select_customer.png)
</Frame>
6. For the second select element (Contract ID) set the following properties:
* **Process data key** - `application.client.selectedContract`
* **Label** - Contract ID
* **Placeholder** - Contract ID
* **Source Type** - Process Data
* **Name** - `application.contracts`
* **Parent** - `SELECT` (choose from the dropdown list)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/select_contract.png)
</Frame>
7. Add a button under the form that contains the select elements with the following properties:
* **Label** - Submit
* **Add UI action** - add the submit action attached earlier to the user task node
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/submit_b.png)
</Frame>
8. Test and run the process by clicking **Start process**.

# Text area
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/text-area
A text area is a form element used to capture multi-line input from users in a conversational interface. The text area component is typically used for longer inputs such as descriptions, comments, or feedback, providing users with more space to type their responses.
<Frame>
![Text area](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/text_area41.png)
</Frame>
It is an important tool for creating intuitive and effective conversational interfaces that can collect and process large amounts of user input.
## Configuring the text area element
### Text area generic settings
These settings added in the Generic tab are available and they apply to all platforms including Web, iOS, and Android:
* [**Process data key**](#prcoess-data-key)
* [**Properties**](#properties)
* [**Datasource**](#datasource-configuration)
* [**Validators**](#validators)
* [**Expressions**](#expressions)
* [**UI actions**](#ui-actions)
* [**Text area styling**](#text-area-styling)
#### Prcoess data key
Process data key creates the binding between form element and process data, so it can be later used in [decisions](../../../node/exclusive-gateway-node), [business rules](../../../actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) or [integrations](../../../node/message-send-received-task-node#from-integration)
#### Properties
* **Label**: The visible label for the text area element.
* **Placeholder**: Text that appears within the text area when it is empty.
* **Has Clear**: Option to include a content clear mechanism.
* **Helpertext**: Additional information about the text area field (can be hidden inside an infopoint).
* **Update on Blur**: Update behavior triggered when the text area loses focus.
#### Datasource configuration
The default value for the element can be configured here, this will autofill the text field when you will run the process.
#### Validators
You can add multiple validators to a text area field. For more details, refer to [**Validators**](../../validators).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/text_area_props.png)
#### Hide/disable expressions
The text area's behavior can be defined using JavaScript expressions for hiding or disabling the element. The following properties can be configured for expressions:
* **Hide condition**: A JavaScript expression used to hide the text area when it is evaluated to your desired result.
* **Disabled condition**: A JavaScript expression used to disable the text area when it returns a truthy value
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/hide_text_area.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
In the example above, we used a rule to hide a text area element if the value of the switch element above is false.
</Info>
#### Hide expression example
We will use the key defined on the switch element to create a JavaScript hide condition to hide the text area element:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/hide_text_area1.png)
</Frame>
* Rule used:
```javascript
${application.client.hasHouse} === false
```
* Result:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/text_area_result.gif)
</Frame>
#### Disable example
For example, you can use a disabled condition to disable a text area element based on what values you have on other elements.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/disable_text_area1.png)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/disable_text_area2.png)
</Frame>
When you choose a specific value on the radio element (Contact via SMS), the text area is disabled based on the disabled condition.
* Rule used:
```javascript
${application.client.contact} == "prfS"
```
<Info>
It's important to make sure that disabled fields have the same expression configured under the path expressions → hide.
</Info>
#### UI actions
UI actions can be added to the text area field to define its behavior and interactions.
* **Event**: Possible value - `CHANGE`.
* **Action Type**: Select the type of the action to be performed.
<Tip>

# Image
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/image
Image UI elements are graphical components of a user interface that display a static or dynamic visual representation of an object, concept, or content.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/image_general.png)
</Frame>
These elements can be added to your interface using the UI Designer tool, and they are often used to convey information, enhance the aesthetic appeal of an interface, provide visual cues and feedback, support branding and marketing efforts, or present complex data or concepts in a more intuitive and accessible way.

## Configuring an image
Configuring an image in the UI Designer involves specifying various settings and properties. Here are the key aspects of configuring an image:
### Image settings
The image settings consist of the following properties:
* **Source location** - the location from where the image is loaded:
* [**Media Library**](#media-library)
* [**Process Data**](#process-data)
* [**External**](#external)
Depending on which **Source location** is selected, different configurations are available:
### Media library

## Styling
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Layout">
When designing for the web, consider the layout options available for the card. These options include:
* **Direction**: Choose between **Horizontal** or **Vertical** alignment to define the flow of components. For example, select Horizontal for a left-to-right layout.
* **Justify (H)**: Specify how content is aligned along the main axis. For instance, select end to align items to the end of the card.
* **Align (V)**: Align components vertically within their card using options such as top, center, or bottom alignment.
* **Wrap**: Enable wrapping to automatically move items to the next line when they reach the end of the card. Useful for creating multi-line layouts.
* **Gap**: Define the space between components to control the distance between each item. Adjusting the gap enhances visual clarity and organization.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Sizing">
Adjusting the size of components is crucial for a responsive design. Fit W (width) offers three options:
* **fill**: Fills the available space.
* **fixed**: Maintains a fixed width.
* **auto**: Adjusts the width automatically based on content.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Frame>
#### Key features
* **Validation API**: The renderer provides a public API for validating custom components before triggering an action.
* **Custom Component Responsibilities**:
* Validate custom forms and return a boolean (`true` for valid, `false` for invalid).
* Display validation errors in the UI for invalid data.
* Populate a `saveData` property with the structured data to be submitted.
* **Configurator Responsibilities**:
* Select custom components in the **Add forms to submit** dropdown when configuring a UI action.
* Set the custom key to store the data submitted by the custom component.
By including custom components in the validation process, you can now validate and retrieve data from custom form sections, ensuring comprehensive and reliable form submission.
# Container
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/container
A container in Flowx is a versatile building block that empowers you to group components and arrange them as needed, providing flexibility in UI design. It can also serve as the root component for your design.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/container_ex.gif)
The following properties can be configured in the container:
## Properties and settings
### Settings (applicable across all platforms)
These settings added in the **Generic** tab are available and they apply to all platforms including Web, iOS, and Android.
#### When used as root
When employed as the root component, the container offers the following settings:
* **Custom UI Payload**: A valid JSON describing the data sent to the frontend when the process reaches a specific user task.
* **Expressions (Hide condition)**: JavaScript expressions utilized to dynamically hide components based on conditions.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/container_root_new.png)
#### When not used as root
When the container is not used as the root, you can configure only the **Hide Condition** property.

# Custom component
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/custom
Custom components are developed in the web application and referenced here by component identifier. This will dictate where the component is displayed in the component hierarchy and what actions are available for the component.
<Warning>
Starting with **3.4.7** platform version, for User Tasks containing UI Elements, when the page is rendered, the Backend (BE) should, by default, send to the Frontend (FE) all available data as process variables with matching keys.
If the User Task also includes a **custom component**, the BE should send, in addition to default keys, objects mentioned in the "Message" option of the root element.
</Warning>
To add a custom component in the template config tree, we need to know its unique identifier and the data it should receive from the process model.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui_designer_custom.png)
The properties that can be configured are as follows:
* **Identifier** - This enables the custom component to be displayed within the component hierarchy and determines the actions available for the component.
* **Input keys** - These are used to specify the pathway to the process data that components will utilize to receive their information.
* [**UI Actions**](../../ui-actions) - actions defined here will be made available to the custom component
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui_designer_custom_settings.png#center)
</Frame>
## Prerequisites (before creation)
* **Angular Knowledge**: You should have a good understanding of Angular, as custom components are created and imported using Angular.
* **Angular CLI**: Ensure that you have Angular CLI installed.
* **Development Environment**: Set up a development environment for Angular development, including Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
* **Component Identifier**: You need a unique identifier for your custom component. This identifier is used for referencing the component within the application.
## Creating a custom component (Web)
To create a Custom Component in Angular, follow these steps:
1. Create a new Angular component using the Angular CLI or manually.
2. Implement the necessary HTML structure, TypeScript logic, and SCSS styling to define the appearance and behavior of your custom component.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/loader_comp.png)
## Importing the component
After creating the Custom Component, you need to import it into your application.
In your `app.module.ts` file (located at src → app → app.module.ts), add the following import statement:
```ts
`import { YourComponent } from '@app/components/yourComponent.component'`
```
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/import_cus.gif)
## Declaration in AppModule
In the same `app.module.ts` file, declare your Custom Component within the `declarations` array in the `@NgModule` decorator:
```ts
@NgModule({
declarations: [
// ...other components
YourComponent
],
// ...other module configurations
})
```
## Declaration in FlxProcessModule
To make your Custom Component available for use in processes created in FLOWX Designer, you need to declare it in `FlxProcessModule`.
In your process.module.ts file (located at src > app > modules > process > process.module.ts), add the following import statement:
```ts
import { YourComponent } from '@app/components/yourComponent.component';
```
Then, declare your Custom Component in the `FlxProcessModule.forRoot` function:
```ts
FlxProcessModule.forRoot({
components: {
// ...other components
yourComponent: YourComponent
},
// ...other module configurations
})
```
## Using the custom component
Once your Custom Component is declared, you can use it for configuration within your application.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/loader_component.gif)
## Data input and actions
The Custom Component accepts input data from processes and can also include actions extracted from a process. These inputs and actions allow you to configure and interact with the component dynamically.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/cst_input_data.png)
## Extracting data from processes
There are multiple ways to extract data from processes to use within your Custom Component. You can utilize the data provided by the process or map actions from the BPMN process to Angular actions within your component.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/cst_loader_input.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
Make sure that the Angular actions that you declare match the names of the process actions.
</Warning>
## Styling with CSS
To apply CSS classes to UI elements within your Custom Component, you first need to identify the UI element identifiers within your component's HTML structure. Once identified, you can apply defined CSS classes to style these elements as desired.
Example:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/Screenshot%202023-10-10%20at%2012.29.51.png)
</Frame>
## Custom component example
Below you can see an example of a basic custom loader component built with Angular:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/2023-10-10%2012.01.58.gif)
## Additional considerations
* **Naming Conventions**: Be consistent with naming conventions for components, identifiers, and actions. Ensure that Angular actions match the names of process actions as mentioned in the documentation.
* **Component Hierarchy**: Understand how the component fits into the overall component hierarchy of your application. This will help determine where the component is displayed and what actions are available for it.
* **Documentation and Testing**: Document your custom component thoroughly for future reference. Additionally, testing is crucial to ensure that the component behaves as expected in various scenarios.
* **Security**: If your custom component interacts with sensitive data or performs critical actions, consider security measures to protect the application from potential vulnerabilities.
* **Integration with FLOWX Designer**: Ensure that your custom component integrates seamlessly with FLOWX Designer, as it is part of the application's process modeling capabilities.

# Table
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/table
The Table component is a versatile UI element allowing structured data display with customizable columns, pagination, filtering, and styling options.
## Overview
The **Table** component is available **only for Web**, built to deliver a consistent design through FlowX.AI’s theming framework. It closely mirrors the [**Collection**](./collection/collection) component functionality, offering dynamic data handling and flexible row/column configurations.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/table_overview.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
**Web-only UI Component:** The Table component is designed specifically for web applications and includes theming options for consistent design across the platform.
</Info>
## Table elements
1. **Table Header (`th`)**\
Displays column labels, typically one `th` element per column.
2. **Rows (`tr`)**\
Each row represents a single data entry from the source array. Rows automatically repeat based on your data size.
3. **Cells**\
Cells hold data points within each row. You can place multiple UI elements (text, image, link, buttons) inside a cell.
4. **Actions Column**\
If you enable row deletion or editing, an actions column is automatically created to handle row-level features (delete icon, edit icon, etc.).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/table_actions_column.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
By default, when you create a new Table, three columns and a matching set of cell placeholders are generated automatically.
</Info>
## Configuring the table
When building a Table, you’ll primarily interact with:
* **Generic Settings** (source key, columns, table body, expressions, styling)
* **Cell-Specific Settings** (sorting, filtering, editing, validators)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/table_settings.png)

This Table component enhances flexibility and offers a cohesive design, integrated with FlowX.AI’s theming framework for a consistent, web-optimized user experience.
## Table UI action
Append a saveData action to the table and configure the UI action’s custom keys with the same key used as source for the table, in order for the backend to take into consideration the updated array.
See [**User Task configuration**](#user-task-configuration) section for more details.
## Actions in table cells
When configuring actions within a Table component, each action is bound to a unique table item key, ensuring that interactions within each cell are tracked and recorded precisely.
The key allows the action to target specific rows and store results or updates effectively.
* **Table Item Save Key**:
* This key is essential for identifying the exact cell or row where an action should be executed and saved.
* It ensures that data within each cell remains distinct and correctly mapped to each table entry.
* **Custom Key for Data Saving**:
* Important: To properly send the data from a selected cell/row to the backend, you must configure both a **Custom Key** (in your `SaveData` action) and a **Table Item Save Key** (in your column/cell configuration) using the same value.
* Having only a `Table Item Save Key` is not sufficient to propagate the updated information. The matching **Custom Key** in the **SaveData** action tells the system which row/cell data to capture and transmit.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/table_item_save_key.png)
</Frame>
* **Supported Action Types** - Available actions include:
* **Action**: Initiates predefined actions within the cell.
* **Start Process Inherit**: Enables workflows inherited from process configurations to be triggered.
* **Upload**: Allows file or data uploads directly within a table cell.
* **External**: Used to create an action that will open a link in a new tab.
## User Task configuration
When configuring a screen in User Task containing table, you must configure the following node actions:
<Steps>
<Step title="Configure SaveData Action">
* The `SaveData` action must be:
* **Manual**: Requires user initiation.
* **Optional**: Not mandatory for task completion.
* **Repeatable**: Can be executed multiple times.
* **Execution Order Constraint**:
* The `SaveData` action can only be executed **before** mandatory actions.
* The UI is built by configurators to ensure the correct execution order of actions.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2014.58.14.png)
</Frame>
* Add an UI action to the table by assigning the previously created node action.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2015.01.16.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
It is important to also add a custom key that is exactly the source key of the table so the platform will be able to know where to save the edits applied in the table.
</Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Add Another Manual and Mandatory Action">
* An additional **manual** and **mandatory** action should be included.
* This ensures that the **token remains within the user task** where the table is rendered.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2014.58.26.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Add Another Action (Optional)">
* You can add another node action if you want to assign an UI action to a table cell element (e.g, a text).
* Assign the UI action to that particular element.
* Make sure it is manual, optional and repeatable (can only be executed before mandatory actions).
</Step>
</Steps>
## FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is the `table item key` used for in Table actions?">
The `table item key` is essential for identifying specific rows and cells within a table. When actions are triggered in table cells, this key ensures that the action applies to the correct item, allowing data to be saved accurately in the intended cell or row. Without this key, actions may not track or save data correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does the Table component differ from Collection?">
While the Table component shares structural similarities with Collection, it is tailored specifically for tabular data. Unlike Collection, it supports easy customization of columns, row pagination, and in-place editing (in future versions), streamlining the handling of tabular data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use conditional styling in Table cells?">
Conditional styling is a planned feature for version 5.0.0. Once available, it will allow you to apply specific styles to cells or rows based on conditions, such as highlighting critical items or overdue entries.

## Custom validators
Additionally, custom validators can be created within the web application and referenced by name. These custom validators can have various configurations such as execution type, name, parameters, and error message.
1. **Execution type** - sync/async validator (for more details check [this](https://angular.io/api/forms/AsyncValidator))
2. **Name** - name provided by the developer to uniquely identify the validator
3. **Params** - if the validator needs inputs to decide if the field is valid or not, you can pass them using this list
4. **Error Message** - the message that will be displayed if the field is not valid
<Warning>
The error that the validator returns **MUST** match the validator name.
</Warning>
<Frame>
![custom validator](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/validator_custom.png#center)
</Frame>
#### Custom validator example
Below you can find an example of a custom validator (`currentOrLastYear`) that restricts data selection to the current or the previous year:
##### currentOrLastYear
```typescript
currentOrLastYear: function currentOrLastYear(AC: AbstractControl): { [key: string]: any } {
if (!AC) {
return null;
}
const yearDate = moment(AC.value, YEAR_FORMAT, true);
const currentDateYear = moment(new Date()).startOf('year');
const lastYear = moment(new Date()).subtract(1, 'year').startOf('year');
if (!yearDate.isSame(currentDateYear) && !yearDate.isSame(lastYear)) {
return { currentOrLastYear: true };
}
return null;
```
##### smallerOrEqualsToNumber
Below is another custom validator example that returns `AsyncValidatorFn` param, which is a function that can be used to validate form input asynchronously. The validator is called `smallerOrEqualsToNumber` and takes an array of `params` as an input.
<Info>
For this custom validator the execution type should be marked as `async` using the UI Designer.
</Info>
```typescript
export function smallerOrEqualsToNumber (params$: Observable<any>[]): AsyncValidatorFn {
return (AC): Promise<ValidationErrors | null> | Observable<ValidationErrors | null> => {
return new Observable((observer) => {
combineLatest(params$).subscribe(([maximumLoanAmount]) => {
const validationError =
maximumLoanAmount === undefined || !AC.value || Number(AC.value) <= maximumLoanAmount ? null : {smallerOrEqualsToNumber: true};
observer.next(validationError);
observer.complete();
});
});
};
}
```
If the input value is undefined or the input value is smaller or equal to the maximum loan amount value, the function returns `null`, indicating that the input is valid. If the input value is greater than the maximum loan amount value, the function returns a `ValidationErrors` object with a key `smallerOrEqualsToNumber` and a value of true, indicating that the input is invalid.
<Info>
For more details about custom validators please check this [link](../../../sdks/angular-renderer).
</Info>
<Tip>
Using validators in your application can help ensure that the data entered by users is valid, accurate, and consistent, improving the overall quality of your application.
</Tip>
It can also help prevent errors and bugs that may arise due to invalid data, saving time and effort in debugging and fixing issues.

## Configuring a new theme
After creating a theme, you must configure it. To configure your theme effectively, follow these steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Access theme settings">
* Navigate to the settings or customization section of your application (in the UI Designer).
* Look for options related to styling and think of an overall design
</Step>
<Step title="Customize theme settings">
<Info>
The Themes styles mechanism is based on hierarchy. In this hierarchy we have the following elements: Design Tokens, Global Settings and Components.
</Info>
Modify color schemes (using the design tokens), typography, spacing, and other visual elements to match your desired look and feel.
Use the provided tools or controls to adjust theme settings. This might include sliders, color pickers, or dropdown menus.
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Design Tokens" icon="pen-ruler">
<Info>
**The Design Tokens** represent values based on which the theme is built.
</Info>
* **Color Palette, Shadows, Typography Tokens**: Configure these tokens based on your company's brand guidelines. They ensure reusability and consistency.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/design_tokens_theme.gif)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Global Settings" icon="gears">
<Info>
The **Global Settings** are properties that inherit values from the **Design Tokens** and sit on the top of the hierarchy. These properties are then inherited by the **Components**.
</Info>
* **Platform-specific Settings**: Configure settings for each platform (web, iOS, Android) based on the global settings you've defined.
* **Styles and Utilities**: General settings applying to all components (styles) and labels, errors, and helper text settings (utilities).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/global_settings_theme.gif)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Component-level configuration" icon="hammer">
<Info>
When setting up your theme, remember that different platforms like web, iOS, and Android have their own settings. You need to configure each platform separately. Only color settings are the same across all platforms.
</Info>
<Tip>
For example, you can configure a web theme, and then leverage the push and import options. You can push from the web the same configuration to iOS or Android.
</Tip>
**Component-level Configuration**: Customize the style of each component type.
<Info>
Keep in mind, there are differences between platforms, for example, for button configuration there are different properties available. What you configure on a platform will not be inherited by the others.
</Info>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/platform-components.gif)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Reviewing the changes (multi-platform)">
* Before finalizing the theme configuration, it's crucial to review how the changes will appear across different platforms. This step ensures consistency and allows for platform-specific adjustments if needed.
* You can do that by either using the preview feature from **Themes** or by using the preview mode in the **UI Designer** by switching to your preffered platform.
<Warning>
Keep in mind that the preview generated in the UI Designer for iOS and Android platforms is an estimate meant to help you visualize how it might look on a mobile view.

</Frame>
## Managing themes - process level (theme overrides)
With the Overrides feature you have now the possibility to override default theme settings on specific elements or sections.
Use Theme Overrides in UI Designer to adjust styles or props for specific UI elements based on the desired platform (Web, iOS and Android).
<Info>
All components can now be styled with token overrides, for color, typography and shadow settings defined in the theme.
</Info>
<Info>
**Theme overrides** in **UI Designer** are applied to the component itself, rather than to specific themes. This means that when switching the view to another theme, the overrides persist and apply to the new theme as well.
</Info>
### Styles tab
The Styles tab functions independently for three platforms: Web, iOS, and Android. Here, you can customize styles for each UI component on each platform.
If you want to customize the appearance of a component to differ from the theme settings, you must apply a **Theme Override**.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/theme_overrides_styless.gif)
<Info>
Theme overrides can be imported from one platform to another.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/theme_overrides_styles.png)
</Info>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/ui_designer_panel2.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
Preview mode: In the UI Designer, overrides are entirely independent of the theme. Regardless of the theme selected in preview mode, you will see the applied override reflected at the UI Designer level.
</Info>
### Preview
When you are editing a process in **UI Designer** you have the possibility of having the preview of multiple themes:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/preview_theme_ui_designer.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
Overrides are completely independent of the theme, regardless of which theme you choose in the preview mode.
</Info>
## Using a Theme in the container application
To integrate the theme into your container application, follow these steps:
* Copy the unique identifier (UUID) associated with the theme.
* Set the copied UUID within your container application.
* By doing so, ensure that the renderers within your application can recognize and apply the specified theme.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/copy_uuid.gif)

## Exporting/importing a theme
The Export/Import functionality in the theme management system allows users to export themes for various purposes such as backup, sharing, or reuse across multiple environments.
Additionally, it enables the seamless import of themes previously exported from other environments, facilitating swift integration and continuity across design workflows.
<Warning>
Import is restricted to internal FlowX mechanisms only; themes from external sources like Figma or Zeplin are not supported.
</Warning>
### Exporting a theme
<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Theme Management** panel within FlowX Designer.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the theme(s) you wish to export.
</Step>
<Step>
From the breadcrumbs menu on the right, select **Export Theme**.
</Step>
<Step>
The exported theme is saved in a standard format (JSON) and can be downloaded to a local directory or storage location.
</Step>
</Steps>

</Steps>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/importing_a_theme.gif)
</Frame>
### Setting a default theme
You can easily establish a default theme by accessing the contextual menu on the right side of a theme and selecting "Set as Default."
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/default_th.png)
</Frame>
When a default theme is not set (or you haven't created a theme yet), the platform automatically assigns the FlowXTheme, which is the platform's default theme. This ensures that there's always a default theme in place to provide a consistent appearance across processes and interactions within the application.
<Info>
In case you select a specific default theme but later you delete it, the platform will revert to the FlowX theme as the default. This safeguard ensures that there's always a default theme available, even if you remove your custom selection.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/2024-04-04%2019.00.33.gif)
</Frame>
</Info>
Upon opening any process within the UI Designer, the default theme is displayed as the initial preview. This gives users a clear starting point and ensures consistency in the appearance of the process until further customization is applied.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/default2.png)
</Frame>
When creating a new process, you will notice the Default Theme (*FlowXTheme*) as the default preview.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/default1.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
Furthermore, when you start a process definition, the theme switch defaults to the default theme in the run process popup from the process definitions list. This ensures that the default theme is consistently applied during the execution of processes, maintaining visual coherence in user interactions.
</Info>
# Adding a new node
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-a-new-node
Once you create a new process definition, you can start configuring it by adding new nodes.
You can choose between a series of available node types below. For an overview of what each node represents, see [BPMN 2.0 basic concepts](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn):
<Card title="What's a BPMN node?" icon="circle-question" href="/4.0/docs/building-blocks/node/node">
<br />
A BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) node is a visual representation of a point in your process. Nodes are added at specific process points to denote the entrance or transition of a record within the process. FlowX supports various node types, each requiring distinct configurations to fulfill its role in the business flow.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/mapf_add_new_node.gif)
</Frame>
Depending on the type of the **node**, you can define some node details, and a set of values (stages, data stream topics, key name) and you can also add various [actions](../../building-blocks/actions/actions) to it.
<Card title="BPMN nodes" href="../../building-blocks/node" icon="file" />
<Check>
Now, check the next section to learn how to add an action to a node.
</Check>
# Adding an action to a node
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/adding-an-action-to-a-node
We use actions to add business decisions to the flow or link the process to custom integrations and plugins.
<Card title="What's a node action?" icon="circle-question">
<br />
A node action is defined as the activity that a node has to handle within a process flow. These actions can vary in type and are utilized to specify communication details for plugins or integrations, include business rules in a process, save data and send various data to be displayed in front-end applications.
</Card>
For more information about actions, check the following section:
<Card title="Actions" href="../../building-blocks/actions" icon="file" />
### Steps for creating an action
To create an action:

### Steps for creating a flow with two branches
To create a flow with two branches:
<Steps>
<Step>
Open **FlowX Designer** and go to the **Definitions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click on the **New process** button, using the **breadcrumbs** from the top-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **start node** and a **parallel gateway node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Create two parallel zones by adding different nodes and link the zones after the **parallel gateway node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Add another **parallel gateway** to merge the two flow branches back into one branch.
</Step>
<Step>
Add an **end node**.
</Step>
</Steps>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/parallel_zn.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
When  working with parallel gateways, tokens play a critical role in ensuring that the process flow is managed correctly. Here's an overview of token behavior in parallel gateways:
<Steps>
<Step>
When a process reaches a parallel gateway, the gateway creates child tokens for each branch in the parallel paths. Each path operates independently.
</Step>
<Step>
Each child token advances through its respective path independently, proceeding from one node to the next based on the sequence and actions defined in the process.
</Step>
<Step>
A closing parallel gateway node is used to merge parallel paths back into a single flow. The parent token waits at this closing gateway until all child tokens have completed their respective paths.
</Step>
</Steps>

# Creating a new process definition
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/creating-a-new-process-definition
The first step of defining your business process in the FlowX.AI Designer is adding a new process definition for it.
This should include at least one [START](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node#start-node) and [END](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node#end-node) node.
## Steps for creating a new process definition
<Card title="What's a proces definition?" icon="circle-question" href="/4.0/docs/building-blocks/process/process-definition">
<br />
A process definition is the core building block of the platform, serving as the blueprint of a business process composed of nodes linked by sequences. Once defined and published on the platform, a process can be executed, monitored, and optimized. Starting a business process results in the creation of a new instance of this definition.

# Exporting / importing a process definition version
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/export-import-a-process-definition
To export process definitions versions and move them between different environments, you can use the export version/ import process feature.
## Export a process definition
You can export a version of your process definition as a JSON file directly from the versioning menu in the **FlowX Designer**:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/export_process_version.png)
</Frame>
## Import a process definition
Given you have exported a version from another environment, when you press the "Import Process" button from the process definition list, then the system opens a local file browser with available JSON files.
There are multiple scenarios you can encounter:
* [**New process definition**](#new-process-definition)
* [**Existing process definition with no additional versions**](#existing-process-definition-with-no-additional-versions)
* [**Existing process definition with additional version**](#existing-process-definition-with-additional-version)
### New process definition
The process definition does not exist in the target environment and when the file is submitted then the process definition is added to the target environment and in the branching tree the imported version is displayed as active and unavailable versions as inactive/ placeholders.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/import_proc_version.png)
</Frame>
#### Unavailable versions
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/unavailable_version.png)
</Frame>
### Existing process definition with no additional versions
The process definition exists in the target environment and does not contain additional versions compared to the ones in the import file. When you submit the file, the branching tree is updated. Imported and existing versions are displayed as active, while unavailable versions are shown as inactive/placeholders.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/import_2.png)
</Frame>
Additionally, if the current publish policy is "latest submitted" or "latest work in progress" and the import file indicates that the publish version will be overwritten, you'll see information about the new published version.
You'll also have the option to update the publish policy:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/case2_update.png)
</Frame>
### Existing process definition with additional version
You have an existing process definition with additional versions, and you want to overwrite versions in conflict while being warned about the published version.
The process definition in the target environment contains additional versions compared to the ones in the import file. These versions are children of parent versions that should receive other children versions after import. In this case, you'll see a message about overwritten versions.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/Frame%2022749.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
In case the process definition was exported using an incompatible FlowX Designer version, you will receive an error and not be able to import it. It will first need to be adjusted to match the format needed by your current FlowX Designer version.
</Warning>
# Handling decisions in the flow
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/handling-decisions-in-the-flow
To add business decisions in the flow and use them to pick between a flow branch or another, we can use exclusive gateways.
<Frame>
![Exclusive Gateway](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/gateway_exclusive.png#center)
</Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/xclsv_mapf.png)
### Steps for creating a flow with exclusive branches
To create flow with exclusive branches:
<Steps>
<Step>
Open **FlowX Designer** and go to the **Definitions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click on the **New process** button, using the **breadcrumbs** from the top-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **start node** and an **exclusive gateway node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Add two different **task nodes** and link them after the **exclusive** **gateway node**.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a new **exclusive gateway** to merge the two flow branches back into one branch.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **new rule** to a node to add a **business decision**:
<Info>
For [business rules](../../building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action), you need to check certain values from the process and pick an outgoing node in case the condition is met. The gateway node must be connected to the next nodes before configuring the rule.
</Info>
* select a **scripting language** from the dropdown, for example `MVEL` and input your condition:
* `input.get("application.client.creditScore") >= 700` ← proceed to node for premium credit card request
* `input.get("application.client.creditScore") < 700` ← proceed to node for standard credit card request
</Step>
<Step>
Add a **closing exclusive gateway** to continue the flow.
</Step>
<Step>
Add and **end node**.
</Step>
</Steps>

# Moving a token backwards in a process
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process
Back in steps is a functionality that allows you to go back in a business process redo a series of previous actions in the process.
**Why is it useful?** Brings a whole new level of flexibility in using a business flow or journey, allowing the user to go back a step without losing all the data inputted so far.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/allow_back_action.png)
</Frame>
In most cases, the **token** instance will just need to advance forward in the process as the actions on the process are completed.
<Card title="Token" href="../../building-blocks/token" />
But there might be cases when the token will need to be moved backward in order to redo a series of previous actions in the process.
We will call this behavior **resetting the token**.
The token can only be reset to certain actions on certain process nodes. These actions will be marked accordingly with a flag `Allow BACK on this action?`.
When such an action is triggered from the application, the current process token will be marked as aborted and a new one will be created and placed on the node that contains the action that was executed. If any sub-processes were started between the two token positions, they will also be aborted when the token is reset.
The newly created token will copy from the initial token all the information regarding the actions that were performed before the reset point.
There are a few configuration options available in order to decide which of the data to keep when resetting the token:
* `Remove the following objects from current state`: Process keys that should be deleted when the user is navigating back tho this action
* `Copy the following objects from current state`: Process keys that should retain their data as persisted prior to the user navigating back to this action.

# Initiating processes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/starting-a-process
Entering the realm of FlowX unlocks a spectrum of possibilities for elevating processes and workflows. From automation to data-driven decision-making, several straightforward approaches pave the way for leveraging this platform efficiently. Let's delve into the ways to kickstart a process.
## Starting a process via Kafka
To trigger a process using a Kafka **Send Action**, follow these steps:
1. **Access Your Project**
* Open **FlowX Designer**.
* Navigate to **Projects** and select your project.
* Choose an existing process definition or create a new one.
2. **Configure the Send Message Task**
* Add a **Send Message Task** to your workflow.
* Attach a **Kafka Send Action** to the **Send Message Task** node.
3. **Define the Kafka Topic**
* Specify the topic linked to the `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_START_BY_NAME` environment variable (details [here](../../../setup-guides/application-manager#process-topics)).
This variable is shared between the **application-manager** and **runtime-manager** deployments.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/start_process_by_name_topic.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
To check further what was sent on Kafka, you can use a tool like AKHQ to check the response sent on the topic defined at `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_START_BY_NAME_OUT` - details [here](../../../setup-guides/application-manager#process-topics).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-02-11%20at%2017.33.58.png)
</Frame>
</Info>
<Info>
To verify the topic in FlowX Designer, navigate to: **Platform status → FlowX Components → application-manager-mngt -> kafkaTopicHealthCheckIndicator → details → configuration → topic → process → start-by-name**:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/topic_kafka.png)
</Frame>
</Info>
4. **Add the Message Body**
* Include the message body with the necessary details (if applicable):
```json
{"test": "something"}
```
5. Configure headers in Advanced Settings
* Expand Advanced Configuration in the Send Message Task settings.
* By default, a custom header is set to:
```json
{"processInstanceId": "${processInstanceId}"}
```
<Info>
This header is not required and can be ignored.
</Info>
* Add the following headers:
* `Fx-ProcessName` → The name of the process you want to start via Kafka.
* `Fx-AppId` → The ID of the project (application) where the process resides.
* `jwt` → Your JWT token for authentication.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/start_process_by_name_headers.png)
</Frame>
The headers section should resemble this structure:
```json
{
"Fx-ProcessName": "test_kafka",
"Fx-AppId": "afcc6452-f50e-4d95-ae3b-6b35caed68bd",
"jwt": "your_jwt"
}
```
<Info>
Without an active policy, the process may not start even if the Kafka message is correctly configured.
</Info>
## Timer start event
To initiate a process using a Start Timer Event:
1. Open FLOWX Designer, head to the Processes tab, then select Definitions.
2. Opt for an existing process definition or create a new one.
3. Incorporate a Start Timer Event and configure it as required, specifying either a specific date or a cycle.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/start_timer_process.png)
<Warning>
Starting a process through registered timers necessitates sending a process start message to Kafka, requiring a service account and authentication. For detailed guidance, refer to:
[**Service Accounts**](../../../setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#scheduler-service-account)
</Warning>
For deeper insights into the Start Timer Event, refer to the section below:
[Start Timer Event](../../building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-start-event)
## Message catch start event
To initiate a process using a Message Catch Start Event, two processes are required. One utilizes a throw message event, while the other employs a start catch message event to initiate the process.
### Configuring the parent process
1. Access FlowX Designer, proceed to the Processes tab, then select Definitions.
2. Opt for an existing process definition or create a new one.
3. Configure your process and integrate a Message Throw Intermediate event.
4. Add a task or a user task where process data bound to a correlation key is included (e.g., 'key1').
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/correlation_data.png)
</Frame>
5. Configure the node, considering message correlation.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/message_correlation.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
Message correlation is vital and achieved through message subscriptions, involving the message name (must be identical for both throw and catch events) and the correlation key (also known as the correlation value).
</Info>
### Configuring the process with catch event
Now, we will configure the process that will be started with the start catch message event:
1. Follow the initial three steps from the previous section.
2. Integrate a Start Message Catch event node.
3. Configure the node:
* Include the same message name for correlation as added in the throw message event (e.g., 'start\_correlation').
* In the Receive data tab, add the Process Key, which is the correlation key added in the throw event (e.g., 'key1').
Once both processes are configured, commence the parent process. At runtime, you'll notice the initiation of the second process:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/start_with_message_event.gif)
## Task management using Hooks
Initiating processes through hooks involves the creation of a hook alongside two essential processes: one acts as the parent process, while the other is triggered by the hook.
### Creating a hook
Hooks play a crucial role in abstracting stateful logic from a component, facilitating independent testing and reusability.
<Info>
Users granted task management permissions can utilize hooks to initiate specific process instances, such as triggering notifications upon event occurrences.
</Info>
Follow the next steps to create a hook:
1. **Create a Hook**: Access FlowX Designer, navigate to the Plugins tab, and choose Task Manager → Hooks.
2. **Configure the Hook**:
* Name: Name of the hook
* Parent process: Process definition name of the parent process
* Type: *Process hook*
* Trigger: *Process Created*
* Triggered Process: Process definition name of the process that we want to trigger
* Activation status
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/hook_created%20copy.png)
For further details about hooks, refer to the section below:
[Hooks](../../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-hooks)
### Setting up the parent process
1. In FlowX Designer, navigate to the Processes tab and select Definitions.
2. Choose an existing process definition or create a new one.
3. Customize your BPMN process to align with your requirements.
4. Ensure the process is integrated with task management. To do this, within your Process Definition, access Settings → General and activate **"Use process in task management"**.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/use_in_task_management.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
Establishing appropriate roles and permissions within the parent process (or the service account used) is mandatory to enable it to trigger another process.
</Info>
Now proceed to configure the process that the hook will trigger.
### Configuring the triggered process
To configure the process triggered by the hook, follow the initial three steps above. Ensure that the necessary roles and permissions are set within the process.
Upon running the parent process, instances will be created for both the parent and the child processes.

## Managing users access
Access Management is used to administrate users, roles and groups, directly in FLOWX Designer. Access Management helps you to access the identity management solution (keycloak/[RH-SSO](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on)) through its API, extracting all the necessary details. Access Management is based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity management solution.

## Designing the BPMN Process: Requesting a New Credit Card from a Bank App
Let's initiate by designing the BPMN process diagram for a sample use case: requesting a new credit card from a bank app.
## Sample Process Steps
Taking a **business process example** of a credit card application, it involves the following steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Business Process Example">
Create a business process example of a credit card application.
</Step>
<Step title="Initiate Credit Card Request">
A user initiates a request for a new credit card - ***Start Event***
</Step>
<Step title="Fill in Personal Data">
The user fills in a form with their personal data - ***User Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Automated Credit Score Check">
The bank system performs a credit score check automatically using a send event that communicates with the credit score adapter, followed by a receive event to collect the response from the adapter - ***Automatic Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Credit Score Bifurcation">
The process bifurcates based on the credit score using an ***Exclusive Gateway***
</Step>
<Step title="Save Credit Card Type">
Each branch entails a service task that saves the appropriate credit card type to the process data - ***Automatic Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Branch Reconciliation">
The branches reconvene through a ***Closing Gateway***
</Step>
<Step title="View and Confirm Credit Card Details">
The user views the credit card details and confirms - ***User Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Parallel Branching">
After user confirmation, the process divides into two parallel branches - ***Parallel Gateway***. One registers the request in the bank's systems (bank system adapter/integration), and the other sends a confirmation email (notification plugin) to the user
</Step>
<Step title="External API Call">
An additional automatic task follows: a call to an external API to compute the distance between the user's address and the bank locations ([Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview)) - ***Automatic Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Sort Location Distances">
A task is utilized to sort the location distances and present the top three to the user - ***Automatic Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Select Card Pickup Point">
The user selects the card pickup point from the bank location suggestions - ***User Task***
</Step>
<Step title="Receive Confirmation">
A receive task awaits confirmation from the bank that the user has collected the new card, concluding the process flow - ***End Event***
</Step>
</Steps>
## Sample Process Diagram
Here's what the **BPMN** diagram illustrates:

# Introduction
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/introduction
FlowX.AI is an AI multi-experience development platform that sits on top of legacy systems and creates unified, scalable digital experiences.
# Why FlowX.AI?
* It captures and unifies data offering enterprises **AI-based optimization** and innovation capabilities.
* It **integrates easily with any infrastructure** and scales it as necessary.
It is a modern <Tooltip tip="FlowX.AI operates as an event-driven platform, coordinating integrations and generating UI based on user actions.">event-driven platform</Tooltip> built on a **microservices architecture**. It uses the most popular **industry standards** for process modeling, business rule management and integrates as easily with legacy systems as with the latest APIs and RPAs.
Also, all applications you create are **containerized, portable, scalable, and resilient** out of the box. You’re free to deploy anywhere and scale to any size without redesign.
FlowX.AI can be deployed in a private cloud, in a public cloud or on-prem, depending on your requirements.
## Why does it matter?
FlowX.AI can be **deployed on top of existing legacy systems, so there is no need for costly or risky upgrade projects.** This helps lower the stress on the IT team and the technology budget since studies show that around 65-75% of the IT budget goes towards maintaining current infrastructure. Now, It’s not reasonable to expect enterprises are just going to rip and replace the legacy stack with new applications. They will do so at some point but for now they need something that enables them to run existing business and gives them some leeway or headspace to create modern digital experiences.
FlowX.AI platform brings **a layer of scalability to your existing stack**, beyond their current capabilities. This is thanks to our Kafka and Redis core that queue messages until the system is able to respond. And best of all, the app user is not experiencing any lag, since data is pre-pulled in the front-end ahead of his actions. A typical use case might sustain 100,000 users per minute, but of course, given our containerized architecture, it can be scaled even more.
**Unified interface across multiple systems or platforms** - often, say for an in-branch onboarding process, a teller has to use 4 or 5 different applications - to access various customer data such as a CRM, public reference checks, a KYC system and so on. With a process designed in FLOWX, you create just one application that unifies the purpose and the data from all those other applications. And this is very liberating for employees, it saves up time, eliminates the possibility of errors and overall, makes the experience of using the onboarding application a pleasant one.
With FlowX you **build omnichannel experiences across all digital channels**, be they web applications, mobile apps or in-branch terminals. What’s more, our applications are built with a hand-off capability - meaning the user can start the process on the web and then pick up on the mobile app later that evening.
**The UI is generated on the fly, by our AI model.** This means that you don’t need coding or design skills to create interfaces. Of course, you can inject your own code for CSS styling, apply your own design system with logo, corporate colors and fonts - but this is just if you want it. By default, you don’t need it.
And of course, when it comes to processes, **we support a no-code/full-code framework that makes the platform available to any citizen developer**. This brings speed to development, since there is no disconnect between business and IT, supports agile ways of working and overall, has a positive impact over creativity and innovation.
## Next steps
We’ll guide you through everything you need to know in order to understand FlowX, deploy it and use it successfully inside your organization.

# FlowX.AI architecture
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/flowx-architecture
Let's delve into the core components that power the **FlowX.AI** platform, providing a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and functionalities.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/architecture_diagram_22_01_24.png)
## FlowX.AI Designer
The [**FlowX.AI Designer**](../flowx-designer/overview) is a collaborative, no-code, web-based application development environment, designed to facilitate the creation of web and mobile applications without the need for coding expertise. It offers a wide range of capabilities:
* Develop processes based on [BPMN 2.0](./frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn) standards.
* Configure user interfaces for processes, both generated and custom.
* Define business rules and validations via [DMN](./frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-dmn) files or via the [MVEL](./frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel), or other supported [scripting languages](../building-blocks/supported-scripts).
* Create [integration connectors](../platform-deep-dive/integrations) in a visual manner.
* Design data models for your applications.
* Adding new capabilities by using [plugins](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins).
* Manage users access roles effectively.
<Info>
[**FlowX Designer**](../flowx-designer/overview) is built to administrate everything in FlowX.AI. It is a web application that runs in the browser, meaning that it resides out of a FlowX deployment.
</Info>
The platform has **no-code/full-code capabilities**, meaning applications can be developed in a visual way, available for anyone with a powerful business idea. So we’re talking about business analysts, product managers - people without advanced programming skills, and also experienced developers.
The process visual designer works on [BPMN 2.0 standard](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn) - meaning that the learning curve for business analysts or product managers is quite fast. Thus, creating new applications (e.g. onboarding an SME client for banks) or adding new functionality (allow personal data changes in an app) takes only 10 days, instead of 6 to 8 months.

<Card title="FlowX.AI Designer" href="../flowx-designer/overview" icon="pen-ruler" />
## Microservices
FlowX.AI leverages a suite of microservices to drive its functionality:
* [**FlowX.AI Engine**](#flowx-ai-engine)
* [**FlowX.AI SDKs**](#flowx-ai-sdks)
* [**FlowX.AI Content Management**](#flowx-ai-content-management)
* [**FlowX.AI Scheduler**](#flowx-ai-scheduler)
* [**FlowX.AI License Manager**](#flowx-ai-license-manager)
* [**FlowX.AI Admin**](#flowx-ai-admin)
### FlowX.AI Engine
We call it the engine because it’s a nice analogy, once deployed on an existing stack, FlowX.AI becomes the core of your digital operating model.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Engine%20Diagram%20%281%29.png)
</Frame>
You can use FlowX Engine to do the following:
* create any type of external or internal facing application
* redesign business processes from analog, paper-based ones to fully digital and automated processes
* manage integrations, so you can hook it up to existing CRMs, ERPs, KYC, transaction data and many more
* to read process definitions (if it is connected to the same database as FlowX Admin)
[FlowX.AI Engine](../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) runs the business processes, coordinating integrations and the omnichannel UI. It is a [Kafka-based](./frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts) event-driven platform, that is able to orchestrate, generate and integrate with any type of legacy system, without expensive or risky upgrades.
This is extremely important because often, digital apps used by a bank’s clients, for example, are limited by the load imposed by the core banking system. And the customers see blocked screens and endlessly spinning flywheels. FlowX.AI buffers this load, offering a 0.2s response time, thus the customer never has to wait for data to load.
<Card title="FlowX.AI Engine" href="../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine" icon="brain-circuit" />
### FlowX.AI SDKs
SDKs are used in the [Web (Angular)](../../sdks/angular-renderer), and [Android](../../sdks/android-renderer) applications to render the process screens and orchestrate the [custom components](../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/custom).
Explore more:
<Card title="FlowX.AI SDKs" href="../../sdks/" icon="window-flip" />
### FlowX.AI Content Management
This is another Java microservice that enables you to store and manage content. **The go-to place for all taxonomies.** The extension offers a convenient way of managing various content pieces such as lists or content translations. Anything that is under content management is managed by the [CMS backend service](../../setup-guides/cms-setup). To store content, the service will use a MongoDB database (unstructured database). For example, each time you edit an [enumeration](../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/enumerations), the FlowX Designer will send an HTTP request to the microservice.
<Card title="Content Management" href="../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/content-management" icon="folder-grid" />
### FlowX.AI Scheduler
If you need to **set a timer on** a process that needs to end after X days, you can use the FlowX Scheduler microservice. It is a service that is able to receive requests (like a reminder application) to remind you in X amount of time to do something.
<Info>
When you start a process, the process must have an expiry date.
</Info>
Scheduler microservice communicates with the FlowX Engine through Kafka Event Queue ⇾ it creates a new message (write some data) then will send that message to Kafka (with the scheduler address) → when the reminder time comes up, the scheduler will put back a new message in the Kafka layer with engine's destination (time + ID of the process).
<Card title="FlowX.AI Scheduler" href="../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/scheduler" icon="clock" />
### FlowX.AI License Manager
Used for displaying usage reports related to the FlowX.AI platform within the FlowX Designer, ensuring transparent monitoring and management of the platform.
<Card title="FlowX.AI License Manager" href="../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/license-engine" icon="file-certificate" />
### FlowX.AI Admin
Used for storing and editing process definitions, FlowX Admin connects to the same database as the FlowX Engine, ensuring consistency in data management.
<Card title="FlowX.AI Admin setup" href="../../setup-guides/admin-setup-guide" icon="user-tie" />
## FlowX.AI custom plugins
Plugins are bits of functionality that allow you to expand the functionality of the platform - for example, we have the following custom plugins:
* [FlowX.AI Notifications](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/notifications-plugin-overview) plugin
* [FlowX.AI Documents](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview) plugin
* [FlowX.AI OCR](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/ocr-plugin) plugin
* [FlowX.AI Task Management](../platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) plugin
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/plugins_architecture.png)
<Card title="Plugins" href="../platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins" icon="puzzle-piece-simple" />
## Authorization & Session Manager
We recommend Keycloak, a component that allows you to create users and store credentials. It can be also used for authorization - defining groups, and assigning roles to users.
Every communication that comes from a consumer application, goes through a public entry point (API Gateway). To communicate with this component, the consumer application tries to start a process and the public entry point will check for authentication (Keycloak will send you a token) and the entry point validates it.
<Card title="Keycloak Documentation" href="https://www.keycloak.org/documentation" icon="link" />
## Integrations
Connecting your legacy systems or third-party apps to the FlowX Engine is easily done through [custom integrations](../platform-deep-dive/integrations/integrations-overview). These can be developed using your preferred tech stack, the only requirement is that they connect to Kafka. These could include legacy APIs, custom file exchange solutions, or RPA.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/integrations_architecture.png)
<Card title="Integrations" href="../platform-deep-dive/integrations/integrations-overview" icon="puzzle-piece" />
In summary, FlowX.AI offers a robust and versatile architecture that empowers users to create, manage, and integrate applications seamlessly, without the need for extensive coding expertise. Its microservices, SDKs, and plugins work in harmony to drive efficiency and innovation in application development and business process management.
# Intro to BPMN
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn
The core element of the platform is a process. Think of it as a representation of your business use case, for example making a request for a new credit card, placing an online food order, registering your new car or creating an online fundraiser supporting your cause.
To easily design and model process flows, we use the standard **BPMN 2.0** graphical representation.
## What is Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)?
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model.
It is **the most widely used standard for business process diagrams**. It is intended to be used directly by the stakeholders who design, manage and realize business processes, but at the same time be precise enough to allow BPMN diagrams to be translated into software process components.
This is why we chose it for modeling the process flows.
## BPMN 2.0 elements
A BPMN business process flow is represented as a set of process elements connected by sequences. Here are the most common types of elements:
<CardGroup>
<Card title="Events" icon="bell" href="#events" />
<Card title="Activities" icon="briefcase" href="#activities" />
<Card title="Gateways" icon="code-branch" href="#gateways" />
<Card title="Pools and lanes" icon="layer-group" href="#pools-and-lanes" />
</CardGroup>
### Events
Events describe something that happens during the course of a process. There are three main events types: start events, intermediate events, and end events. These three types are also defined as either catching events (they react to a trigger) or throwing events (they are triggered by the process).
<Frame>
![basic event types](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn/events.png)
</Frame>
### Activities
An activity represents a unit of work to be performed by the business process. An activity can be atomic (a task) or can represent a group of more activities (a subprocess).
<Frame>
![various types of activities](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn/activities.png)
</Frame>
### Gateways
Gateways are used to control how a process flows. They act as a decision point that picks which sequence flow should the [**process instance**](../../../projects/runtime/active-process/process-instance) take. This is based on the result of the evaluation of condition(s) specified (in case of exclusive gateways) or they can be used to split a process into more branches (in case of parallel gateways).
<Frame>
![exclusive and parallel gateways](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn/gateways.png)
</Frame>
### Pools and lanes
Pools and lanes are used in order to group the process steps by process participants. To show that certain user roles are responsible for performing specific process steps you can divide the process using lanes.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn/swimlanes_pool.png)
</Frame>
## BPMN basic concepts
Let's get into a bit more details on the main types of BPMN process elements.
### Events
Events are signals that something happens within a process, including its start and end and any interactions with the process environment.
Types of Events:
* Start Events
* End Events
* Intermediate Events
### Start and End events
**Start & End events**

|                                                                             Event that triggers the process                                                                            |                                                               Event that defines the state that terminates the process                                                               |
### Intermediate events
An intermediate event occurs between a start and an end event. It is represented by a circle with a double line, indicating its ability to both catch and throw information.
#### Message events
Message events serve as a means to incorporate messaging capabilities into business process modeling. These events are specifically designed to capture the interaction between different process participants by referencing messages.
### Activities
#### Task
An atomic activity within a process flow, created when the activity cannot be broken down further. A task belongs to one lane.

#### User Task
A task performed by the user without aid from a business process execution engine or application, requiring a certain action in the application.
#### Service Task
Executed by a business process engine. The task defines a script that the FlowX Engine can interpret and execute, completing when the script finishes. It can also run a [**business rule**](../../../building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) on the process data.
### BPMN Subprocesses
In BPMN, a subprocess is a compound activity that represents a collection of other tasks and subprocesses. Generally, we create BPMN diagrams to communicate processes with others. To facilitate effective communications, we really do not want to make a business process diagram too complex. By using subprocesses, you can split a complex process into multiple levels, which allows you to focus on a particular area in a single process diagram.
### Gateways
Gateways allow to control as well as merge and split the **process flow**.
#### Exclusive gateways
In business processes, you typically need to make choices — **business decisions**. The most common type of decision is choosing **either/or**. Exclusive Gateways limit the possible outcome of a decision to a single path, and circumstances choose which one to follow.
#### Parallel gateways
In many cases, you want to split up the flow within your business process. For example the sales and risk departments may examine a new mortgage application at the same time. This reduces the total cycle time for a case. To express parallel flow in BPMN, you use a **parallel gateway**.
|                                                                      Exclusive gateway (XOR)                                                                      |                                                                      Parallel gateway (AND)                                                                      |

# Intro to DMN
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-dmn
As we've seen in the previous chapter, Business Process Model and Notation BPMN is used to define business processes as a sequence of activities. If we need to branch off different process paths, we use gateways. These have rules attached to them in order to decide on which outgoing path should the process continue on.
![Process with gateways](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/process_with_gateways.png)
<Info>
For more information on how to define DMN gateway decisions, check the [**Exclusive gateway node**](../../../building-blocks/node/exclusive-gateway-node) section.

We needed a convenient way of specifying the <Tooltip tip="Business rules are actions that can be configured on task/user task nodes in a business process. Business rules can be written in various script languages such as MVEL, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, or DMN (Decision Model and Notation)."> **business rules** </Tooltip> and we picked two possible ways of writing business rules:
* defining them as DMN decisions

### What is Decision Model and Notation (DMN)?
**Decision Model and Notation** (or DMN) is a graphical language that is used to specify business decisions. DMN acts as a translator, converting the code behind complex decision-making into easily readable diagrams.
**The Business Process Model and Notation** is used to create the majority of process models **(BPMN)**. The DMN standard was developed to complement BPMN by providing a mechanism for modeling decision-making represented by a Task within a process model. DMN does not have to be used in conjunction with BPMN, but it is highly compatible.
<Warning>
FLOWX.AI supports [DMN 1.3](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/) version.
</Warning>
### DMN Elements
There are 4 basic elements of the **Decision Model and Notation**:
* [Decision](#decision)
* [Business Knowledge Model](#business-knowledge-model)
* [Input Data](#input-data)
* [Knowledge Source](#knowledge-source)
![Basic DMN Diagram](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/dmn_diagram.png)
#### Decision
It’s the center point of a DMN diagram and it symbolizes the action that determines as output the result of a decision.
**Decision service**
A decision service is a high-level decision with well-defined inputs that is made available as a service for invocation. An external application or business process can call the decision service (BPMN).
#### Business Knowledge Model
It portrays a specific knowledge within the business. It stores the origin of the information. Decisions that have the same logic but depend on different sub-input data or sub-decisions use business knowledge models to determine which procedure to follow.
**Example:** a decision, rule, or standard table.
#### Input Data
This is the information used as an input to the normal decision. It’s the variable that configures the result. Input data usually includes business-level concepts or objects relevant to the business.
**Example:** Entering a customer’s tax number and the amount requested in a credit assessment decision.
#### Knowledge Source
It’s a source of knowledge that conveys a kind of legitimacy to the business.
**Example**: policy, legislation, rules.
### DMN Decision Table
A decision table represents decision logic which can be depicted as a table in Decision Model and Notation. It consists of inputs, outputs, rules, and hit policy.
| Decision table elements |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inputs                  | A decision table can have one or more input clauses, that represent the attributes on which the rule should be applied.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Outputs                 | Each entry with values for the input clause needs to be associated with output clauses. The output represents the result that we set if the rules applied to the input are met.                                                                                                                 |
| Rules                   | Each rule contains input and output entries. The input entries are the condition and the output entries are the conclusion of the rule. If each input entry (condition) is satisfied, then the rule is satisfied and the decision result contains the output entries (conclusion) of this rule. |
| Hit policy              | The hit policy specifies what the result of the decision table is in cases of overlapping rules, for example, when more than one rule matches the input data.                                                                                                                                   |

### DMN Model
DMN defines an XML schema that allows DMN models to be used across multiple DMN authoring platforms.
You can use this XML example with FLOWX Designer, adding it to a Business Rule Action - using an MVEL script. Then you can switch to DMN if you need to generate a graphical representation of the model.
### Using DMN with FLOWX Designer
As mentioned previously, DMN can be used with FLOWX Designer for the following scenarios:
* For defining gateway decisions, using [exclusive gateways](../../../building-blocks/node/exclusive-gateway-node)
* For defining [business rules actions](../../../building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action) attached to a [task node](../../../building-blocks/node/task-node)

# Intro to MVEL
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel
We can also specify the business rules logic using MVEL scripts. As opposed to DMN, with MVEL you can create complex business rules with multiple parameters and sub-calculations.
## What is MVEL?
**MVFLEX Expression Language** (MVEL) is an expression language with a syntax similar to the Java programming language. This makes it relatively easy to use in order to define more complex business rules and that cannot be defined using DMN.
The runtime allows MVEL expressions to be executed either interpretively, or through a pre-compilation process with support for runtime byte-code generation to remove overhead. We pre-compile most of the MVEL code in order to make sure the process flow advances as fast as possible.
## Example
```java
if( input.get("user.credit_score") >= 700 ) {
output.setNextNodeName("TASK_SET_CREDIT_CARD_TYPE_PREMIUM");
} else {
output.setNextNodeName("TASK_SET_CREDIT_CARD_TYPE_STANDARD");
}

# Intro to Elasticsearch
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-elasticsearch
Elasticsearch itself is not inherently event-driven, it can be integrated into event-driven architectures or workflows. External components or frameworks detect and trigger events, and Elasticsearch is utilized to efficiently index and make the event data searchable.
This integration allows event-driven systems to leverage Elasticsearch’s powerful search and analytics capabilities for real-time processing and retrieval of event data.
## What is Elasticsearch?
Elasticsearch is a powerful and highly scalable open-source search and analytics engine built on top of the [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) library. It is designed to handle a wide range of data types and is particularly well-suited for real-time search and data analysis use cases. Elasticsearch provides a distributed, document-oriented architecture, making it capable of handling large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
## How it works?
At its core, Elasticsearch operates as a distributed search engine, allowing you to store, search, and retrieve large amounts of data in near real-time. It uses a schema-less JSON-based document model, where data is organized into indices, which can be thought of as databases. Within an index, documents are stored, indexed, and made searchable based on their fields. Elasticsearch also provides powerful querying capabilities, allowing you to perform complex searches, filter data, and aggregate results.
## Why it is useful?
One of the key features of Elasticsearch is its distributed nature. It supports automatic data sharding, replication, and node clustering, which enables it to handle massive amounts of data across multiple servers or nodes. This distributed architecture provides high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that data remains accessible even in the event of hardware failures or network issues.
Elasticsearch integrates with various programming languages and frameworks through its comprehensive RESTful API. It also provides official clients for popular languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, making it easy to interact with the search engine in your preferred development environment.
## Indexing & sharding
### Indexing
Indexing refers to the process of adding, updating, or deleting documents in Elasticsearch. It involves taking data, typically in JSON format, and transforming it into indexed documents within an index. Each document represents a data record and contains fields with corresponding values. Elasticsearch uses an inverted index data structure to efficiently map terms or keywords to the documents containing those terms. This enables fast full-text search capabilities and retrieval of relevant documents.
### Sharding
Sharding, on the other hand, is the practice of dividing index data into multiple smaller subsets called shards. Each shard is an independent, self-contained index that holds a portion of the data. By distributing data across multiple shards, Elasticsearch achieves horizontal scalability and improved performance. Sharding allows Elasticsearch to handle large amounts of data by parallelizing search and indexing operations across multiple nodes or servers.
Shards can be configured as primary or replica shards. Primary shards contain the original data, while replica shards are exact copies of the primary shards, providing redundancy and high availability. By having multiple replicas, Elasticsearch ensures data durability and fault tolerance. Replicas also enable parallel search operations, increasing search throughput.
Sharding offers several advantages. It allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes, enabling parallel processing and faster search operations. It also provides fault tolerance, as data is replicated across multiple shards. Additionally, sharding allows Elasticsearch to scale horizontally by adding more nodes and distributing the data across them.
The number of shards and their allocation can be determined during index creation or modified later. It is important to consider factors such as the size of the dataset, hardware resources, and search performance requirements when deciding on the number of shards.
For more details, check Elasticsearch documentation:
<Card icon="link" title="Elasticsearch documentation" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html" />
## Leveraging Elasticsearch for advanced indexing with FlowX.AI
The integration between FlowX.AI and Elasticsearch involves the indexing of specific keys or data from the [**UI Designer**](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/) to [process definitions](../../../building-blocks/process/process-definition). The indexing process is initiated by the [FlowX Engine](../../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) which sends the data to Elasticsearch, where data is then indexed in the "process\_instance" index.
There are two methods available for indexing data: Kafka and HTTP.
* **Kafka**: Data is sent to be indexed through a Kafka topic using the new strategy. Deploy the [**Kafka Connect with Elasticsearch Sink Connector**](../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/elasticsearch-indexing.mdx#kafka-connect) in the infrastructure to utilize this method.
* **HTTP**: Data is indexed by establishing a direct connection from the FlowX Engine to Elasticsearch. Use HTTP calls to connect directly from the FlowX Engine to Elasticsearch.
To ensure effective indexing of process instances' details, a crucial step involves defining a mapping that specifies how Elasticsearch should index the received messages. This mapping is essential as the process instances' details often have specific formats. The process-engine takes care of this by automatically creating an index template during startup if it doesn't already exist. The index template acts as a blueprint, providing Elasticsearch with the necessary instructions on how to index and organize the incoming data accurately. By establishing and maintaining an appropriate index template, the integration between FLOWX.AI and Elasticsearch can seamlessly index and retrieve process instance information in a structured manner.
### Kafka transport strategy
[Kafka](../event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts) transport strategy implies process-engine sending messages to a Kafka topic whenever there is data from a process instance to be indexed. Kafka Connect is then configured to read these messages from the topic and forward them to Elasticsearch for indexing.
This approach offers benefits such as fire-and-forget communication, where the process-engine no longer needs to spend time handling indexing requests. By decoupling the process-engine from the indexing process and leveraging Kafka as a messaging system, the overall system becomes more efficient and scalable. The process-engine can focus on its core responsibilities, while Kafka Connect takes care of transferring the messages to Elasticsearch for indexing.
To optimize indexing response time, Elasticsearch utilizes multiple indices created dynamically by the Kafka Connect connector. The creation of indices is based on the timestamp of the messages received in the Kafka topic. The frequency of index creation, such as per minute, hour, week, or month, is determined by the timestamp format configuration of the Kafka connector.
It's important to note that the timestamp used for indexing is the process instance's start date. This means that subsequent updates received for the same object will be directed to the original index for that process instance. To ensure proper identification and indexing, it is crucial that the timestamp of the message in the Kafka topic corresponds to the process instance's start date, while the key of the message aligns with the process instance's UUID. These two elements serve as unique identifiers for determining the index in which a process instance object was originally indexed.

# Intro to Kafka concepts
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.
Kafka is a unified platform for handling all the real-time data feeds. Kafka supports low latency message delivery and gives a guarantee for fault tolerance in the presence of machine failures. It can handle many diverse consumers. Kafka is very fast, and performs 2 million writes/sec. Kafka persists all data to the disk, which essentially means that all the writes go to the page cache of the OS (RAM). This makes it very efficient to transfer data from a page cache to a network socket.
### Benefits of using Kafka
* **Reliability** − Kafka is distributed, partitioned, replicated, and fault-tolerant
* **Scalability** − Kafka messaging system scales easily without downtime
* **Durability** − Kafka uses Distributed commit log which means messages persist on disk as fast as possible
* **Performance** − Kafka has high throughput for both publishing and subscribing messages. It maintains a stable performance even though many TB of messages are stored.
## Key Kafka concepts
### Events
Kafka encourages you to see the world as sequences of events, which it models as key-value pairs. The key and the value have some kind of structure, usually represented in your language’s type system, but fundamentally they can be anything. Events are immutable, as it is (sometimes tragically) impossible to change the past.
### Topics
Because the world is filled with so many events, Kafka gives us a means to organize them and keep them in order: topics. A topic is an ordered log of events. When an external system writes an event to Kafka, it is appended to the end of a topic.
In FLOWX.AI, Kafka handles all communication between the [FlowX Engine](../../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) and external plugins and integrations. It is also used for notifying running process instances when certain events occur.  More information about KAFKA configuration on the section below:
<Card title="FlowX Engine setup guide" href="../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup" icon="gears" />
### Producer
A producer is an external application that writes messages to a Kafka cluster, communicating with the cluster using Kafka’s network protocol.
### Consumer
The consumer is an external application that reads messages from Kafka topics and does some work with them, like filtering, aggregating, or enriching them with other information sources.

# Intro to Kubernetes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in containerized application deployment, management, and scaling.
The purpose of Kubernetes is to orchestrate containerized applications to run on a cluster of hosts. **Containerization** enables you to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.
Kubernetes, as an open platform, enables you to build applications using your preferred programming language, operating system, libraries, or messaging bus. To schedule and deploy releases, existing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools can be integrated with Kubernetes.
## Benefits of using Kubernetes
* A proper way of managing containers
* High availability
* Scalability
* Disaster recovery
## Key Kubernetes Concepts
### Node & PODs
A Kubernetes node is a machine that runs containerized workloads as part of a Kubernetes cluster. A node can be a physical machine or a virtual machine, and can be hosted on-premises or in the cloud.
A pod is composed of one or more containers that are colocated on the same host and share a network stack as well as other resources such as volumes. Pods are the foundation upon which Kubernetes applications are built.
Kubernetes uses pods to run an instance of your application. A pod represents a single instance of your application.
Pods are typically ephemeral, disposable resources. Individually scheduled pods miss some of the high availability and redundancy Kubernetes features. Instead, pods are deployed and managed by Kubernetes *Controllers*, such as the Deployment Controller.
### Service & Ingress
**Service** is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy for accessing them. In Kubernetes, a Service is a REST object, similar to a pod. A Service definition, like all REST objects, can be POSTed to the API server to create a new instance. A Service object's name must be a valid [RFC 1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) label name.
**Ingress** is a Kubernetes object that allows access to the Kubernetes services from outside of the Kubernetes cluster. You configure access by writing a set of rules that specify which inbound connections are allowed to reach which services. This allows combining all routing rules into a single resource.
**Ingress controllers** are pods, just like any other application, so they’re part of the cluster and can see and communicate with other pods.  An Ingress can be configured to provide Services with externally accessible URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and provide name-based virtual hosting. An Ingress controller is in charge of fulfilling the Ingress, typically with a load balancer, but it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to assist with the traffic.
FlowX.AI offers a predefined NGINX setup as Ingress Controller. The [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-ingress-controller/) works with the [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/) web server (as a proxy). For more information, check the below sections:
<Card title="Intro to NGINX" href="./intro-to-nginx" />
<Card title="FlowX Designer setup guide" href="../../../../setup-guides/designer-setup-guide" />
### ConfigMap & Secret
**ConfigMap** is an API object that makes it possible to store configuration for use by other objects. A ConfigMap, unlike most Kubernetes objects with a spec, has `data` and `binaryData` fields. As values, these fields accept key-value pairs. The `data` field and `binaryData` are both optional. The data field is intended to hold UTF-8 strings, whereas the `binaryData` field is intended to hold binary data as base64-encoded strings.
<Info>
The name of a ConfigMap must be a valid [DNS subdomain name](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
</Info>
**Secret** represents an amount of sensitive data, such as a password, token, or key. Alternatively, such information could be included in a pod specification or a container image. Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but they are designed to keep confidential data.
### **Volumes**
A Kubernetes volume is a directory in the orchestration and scheduling platform that contains data accessible to containers in a specific pod. Volumes serve as a plug-in mechanism for connecting ephemeral containers to persistent data stores located elsewhere.
### **Deployment**
A deployment is a collection of identical pods that are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment Controller. A deployment specifies the number of pod replicas that will be created. If pods or nodes encounter problems, the Kubernetes Scheduler ensures that additional pods are scheduled on healthy nodes.
Typically, deployments are created and managed using `kubectl create` or `kubectl apply`. Make a deployment by defining a manifest file in YAML format.
## Kubernetes Architecture
Kubernetes architecture consists of the following main parts:
* Control Plane (master)
* kube-apiserver
* etcd
* kube-scheduler
* kube-controller-manager
* cloud-controller-manager
* Node components
* kubelet
* kube-proxy
* Container runtime
## Install tools
### kubectl
`kubectl` makes it possible to run commands against Kubernetes clusters using the `kubectl` command-line tool. `kubectl` can be used to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and inspect logs. See the `kubectl` [reference documentation ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)for more information.
### kind
`kind` command makes it possible to run Kubernetes on a local machine. As a prerequisite, Docker needs to be installed and configured. What `kind` is doing is to run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.

# Intro to NGINX
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-nginx
NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance web server with a rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption that can also function as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, HTTP cache, and many other things.
### How NGINX is working?
NGINX allows you to hide a server application's complexity from a front-end application. It uses an event-driven, asynchronous approach to create a new process for each web request, with requests handled in a single thread.
### Using NGINX with FlowX Designer
[**The NGINX Ingress Controller for Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) - `ingress-nginx` is an ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
Ingress allows you to route requests to services based on the host or path of the request, centralizing a number of services into a single entry point.
The [ingress resource](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-resources/) simplifies the configuration of **SSL/TLS** **termination**, **HTTP load-balancing**, and **layer routing**.
For more information, check the following section:
<Card title="Using NGINX as a K8s ingress controller" icon="link" href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/videos/using-nginx-as-a-kubernetes-ingress-controller" />
#### Integrating with FlowX Designer
FlowX Designer is using NGINX ingress controller for the following actions:
1. For routing calls to plugins
2. For routing calls to the [FlowX Engine](../../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine):
* Viewing current instances of processes running in the FlowX Engine
* Testing process definitions from the FlowX Designer - route the API calls and SSE communications to the FLOWX engine backend
* Accessing REST API of the backend microservice
3. For configuring the Single Page Application (SPA) - FlowX Designer SPA will use the backend service to manage the platform via REST calls
In the following section, you can find a suggested NGINX setup, the one used by FlowX.AI:

# Intro to Redis
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-redis
Redis is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store that is commonly used as a cache to store frequently accessed data in memory so that applications can be responsive to users. It delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for applications.
It is also used as a Pub/Sub messaging solution, allowing messages to be passed to channels and for all subscribers to that channel to receive that message. This feature enables information to flow quickly through the platform without using up space in the database as messages are not stored.
Redis offers a primary-replica architecture in a single node primary or a clustered topology. This allows you to build highly available solutions providing consistent performance and reliability. Scaling the cluster size up or down is done very easily, this allows the cluster to adjust to any demands.

</Frame>
## Overview
A project groups resources that represent a project's entire lifecycle. It's not just a collection of processes; it's an organized workspace containing all dependencies required for that project, from themes and templates to integrations and other resources. Projects enable you to:
* Create Versions of a project to manage changes over time.
* Deploy Builds for consistent environments.
* Organize Resources to ensure clarity and reduce errors.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/application/application_processes.png)
</Frame>
## Core features
<CardGroup>
<Card title="Centralized Resource Management" icon="folder">
Projects provide a single view of all resources referenced in a process, enabling you to manage everything from one central workspace. This approach reduces context-switching and keeps configuration focused.
</Card>
<Card title="Localization and Multi-Language Support" icon="globe">
Projects support the definition of multiple locales, allowing for easy handling of regional content and settings. Enumerations, substitution tags, and media can be localized to meet specific environment requirements.
</Card>
<Card title="Version Control and Builds" icon="code-branch">
Projects support a robust versioning mechanism that tracks changes to processes, resources, and configurations. The Project Version captures a snapshot of all included resources, while the Build consolidates everything into a deployable package. Each build contains only one version of a project, ensuring a consistent deployment.
</Card>
<Card title="Dependency Management" icon="line-columns">
Projects can leverage Libraries, which act similarly to projects but are designed for resource sharing across projects. A library can contain reusable components like processes or templates that can be included in other projects. Dependencies between projects and libraries are managed carefully to ensure compatibility.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
## Config
Config mode is the environment where you set up, adjust, and manage your project's resources, processes, and configurations. It's the workspace where you fine-tune every aspect of the project before it's ready for deployment. Think of it as the design phase, where the focus is on setup, organization, and preparation.

<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/media_library_app.png)
</Frame>
### Task Management
* **Views**: Views are configurable interfaces that present task-related data based on specific business process definitions. They allow users to create tailored visualizations of task information, utilizing filters, sorting options, and custom parameters to focus on relevant data.
* **Hooks**: Custom scripts or actions triggered at specific points in a task's lifecycle.
* **Stages**: The phases that a task goes through within a workflow (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
* **Allocation Rules**: Criteria for assigning tasks within workflows based on predefined rules (e.g., user roles, availability).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/app_task_manager.gif)
</Frame>
### Integrations
* **Systems (API Endpoints)**: Configurations for connecting to external systems via REST APIs. These endpoints facilitate data exchange and integration with third-party platforms.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/systems_overview.png)
</Frame>
* **Workflows**: Workflows are configurable sequences of tasks and decision nodes that automate data processing, system interactions, and integrations, enabling efficient communication and functionality across different projects and services.
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/create_workflow.mp4" />
### Dependencies
Dependencies refer to the relationship between a project and the external resources it relies on, typically housed in a **Library**. These dependencies allow projects to access and utilize common assets, like processes, enumerations, or media files, from another project without duplicating content. By managing dependencies effectively, organizations can ensure that their projects remain consistent, efficient, and modular, streamlining both development and maintenance.
* **Libraries**: A library is a special type of project that stores reusable resources. Projects can declare a library as a dependency to gain access to the resources stored within it.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/libraries_dependencies.gif)
</Frame>
* **Build-Specific Dependencies**: When a a project adds a library as a dependency, it does so by referencing a specific build of that library
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/build_library.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
This build-specific dependency ensures that changes in the library do not automatically propagate to the dependent projects, providing stability and control over which version is in use.
</Info>
* **Versioning**: Dependencies are versioned, meaning a project can rely on a particular version of a library's build. This versioning capability allows projects to remain insulated from future changes until they are ready to update to a newer version.

### Configuration Parameters
Configuration Parameters are essential components that allow projects to be dynamic, flexible, and environment-specific. They provide a way to manage variables and values that are likely to change based on different deployment environments (e.g., Development, QA, Production), without requiring hardcoded changes within the project. This feature is particularly useful for managing sensitive information and environment-specific settings.
* **Set environment-specific values**: Tailor your project's behavior depending on the target environment.
* **Store sensitive data securely**: Store API keys, passwords, or tokens securely using environment variables.
* **Centralize settings**: Manage common values in one place, making it easier to update settings across multiple processes or integrations.

# Libraries
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/managing-applications/libraries
Libraries are specialized projects that serve as reusable containers for resources that can be shared across multiple projects.
<Frame>
![FlowX.AI Designer](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/designer_new.png)
</Frame>
Unlike regular projects, which are intended for creating and managing specific workflows, libraries are designed to house common elements—like processes, enumerations, and media assets—that other projects may rely upon.
This makes libraries a cornerstone for establishing consistency and efficiency across various projects.
#### Key features
* **Resource Sharing**:
* Libraries facilitate the reuse of resources like processes, enumerations, and media assets across different projects. This allows for a more modular design, where commonly used elements are stored centrally.
* Resources in a library can be included in other projects by setting the library as a dependency.
* **Dependencies**:
* A project can add a library as a dependency, meaning it will have access to the resources stored in that library.
* Dependencies are managed through builds; each project can choose a specific version (build) of a library to depend on. This ensures that updates in the library do not automatically impact all projects unless intended.
* **Versioning**:
* Just like projects, libraries can be versioned. Each version of a library captures the state of its resources at a specific point in time.
* This versioning allows projects to lock dependencies to specific library versions, providing stability and predictability during runtime.
#### Managing libraries
1. **Creating a Library**:
* Libraries can be created similarly to projects. The creation process involves setting a name, defining the resources it will contain, and managing its configuration settings.
* Once created, resources can be added to the library incrementally, allowing for iterative development.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/application/docs_library.png)
</Frame>
2. **Managing Library Resources**:
* Users can create, edit, delete, or version resources within the library. Resources include processes, enumerations, media files, and other elements that can be referenced by projects.
* A library can have multiple versions, each capturing the resource state. This allows backward compatibility with older project builds relying on specific library versions.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/application/library_build.png)
</Frame>
3. **Adding Library Dependencies to Projects**:
* In the project workspace, libraries can be set as dependencies under the **Dependencies** section.
* Users can select which build version of the library to reference. This allows projects to control how library changes affect them by choosing to update the dependency to newer library builds as needed.
<Info>
Libraries can be added as a dependency only to Work-In-Progress (WIP) project versions.
</Info>
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/application/library_depend.mp4" />
</Frame>
#### Library build process
* **Builds in Libraries** are tagged versions, allowing a snapshot of the current library resources to be used by projects. Each build in a library captures the state of all its resources.
* Projects referencing a library can specify the exact build to use, ensuring that changes to the library do not inadvertently impact dependent projects.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/application/library_build.gif)
</Frame>
#### Use cases
1. **Centralized Resource Management**:
* Organizations that need to maintain a standard set of processes or other resources can use libraries to store these centrally. Each project can then use the same library resources, ensuring consistency.
2. **Version-Controlled Dependency Management**:
* By utilizing builds and versioning within libraries, projects can safely depend on specific versions, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior due to resource updates.
3. **Streamlining Updates Across Projects**:
* When an update is required across multiple projects that rely on the same resources, it can be done by updating the library and releasing a new build. Each project can then choose to update to the new build when ready.
## Best practices
* Use libraries for resources that need to be standardized across multiple projects.
* Carefully manage dependencies and choose specific builds to avoid unexpected runtime behavior.
* Leverage versioning to maintain a clear history of resource changes, allowing rollbacks if necessary.
Libraries thus play a crucial role in modularizing the development process, enabling reusable and maintainable components across different projects. This leads to improved project organization, reduced redundancy, and simplified resource management.
## FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I add a library as a dependency to an project?">
**A:** In the project workspace, navigate to the **Dependencies** section. Select the library you want to add, choose the specific build version, and confirm. Once added, the resources from that library will be available for use within the project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens if a resource in a library is updated?">
**A:** When a resource in a library is updated, dependent projects will not be affected unless the library build they reference is updated to a newer version. This allows projects to maintain stability by controlling when updates are adopted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use multiple libraries as dependencies for a single project?">
**A:** Yes, a project can depend on multiple libraries. Each library can be referenced by selecting the desired build version. However, ensure that dependencies are managed carefully to avoid conflicts or redundancy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What should I do if a newer library build is available?">
**A:** Before switching to a newer library build, test it in a development or staging environment to ensure compatibility. If everything functions as expected, update the project’s dependency to the new build in the **Dependencies** section.

# Versioning
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/managing-applications/versioning
Easily track and manage your project's evolution with comprehensive versioning features.
Versioning enables you to manage changes, track progress, and collaborate effectively by capturing snapshots of your project's state at any point in time. The versioning system ensures that resources are grouped and tracked as part of the project, providing a comprehensive and structured approach to development.
## Project version
A **Project Version** is an editable snapshot of your project at a specific moment. It contains all resources (e.g., processes, integrations, templates) and configurations grouped under the project.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-22%20at%2019.09.53.png)
</Frame>
The tab above provides a summary of all accessible project versions and branches available in the current environment.
<Info>
Resources within a project (e.g., processes, integrations, templates) are versioned as part of the project, not individually.
</Info>
<Info>
Certain resources are considered **global** and are not included in project-specific versioning. These resources are shared across projects and environments to maintain consistency and simplify their management. Examples of such global resources include:
* **Themes**: Predefined design themes used across multiple projects.
* **Fonts**: A library of fonts accessible globally.
* **Global Media Files**: Shared media assets.
* **Out of Office Settings**: Configurations for user availability and auto-responses that are managed at the platform level.

### Detailed steps for operations
<Steps>
<Step title="Create Project">
* A new project is created in draft (WIP) state.
* An initial draft project version is automatically generated.
</Step>
<Step title="Create Resource">
* Adds a resource in draft status to the current project version.
* Updates the project manifest to include:
* **UUID** of the new resource.
* `last_change_time`: Set to the current timestamp.
* `last_committed_time`: Null (since the resource is WIP).
</Step>
<Step title="Edit Resource">

* Updates the project manifest:
* Links to the new draft resource.
* `last_change_time`: Current timestamp.
</Step>
<Step title="Commit Project">
* Commits the current draft project version:
1. **draft Resources**:
* Status: Updated to `COMMITTED`.
* `last_change_time` and `last_committed_time`: Set to the current timestamp.

</Step>
</Steps>
***
## Lifecycle of a project version
1. **Create Project**: Automatically starts with a draft (work-in-progress) project version.
2. **Modify Resources**: Draft (WIP) resources can be edited directly, while `COMMITTED` resources are cloned into draft (WIP) before editing.
3. **Commit Changes**: Promotes the project version and its resources to `COMMITTED` status.
4. **Start New WIP**: Allows iterative development by creating a new draft version.
5. **Create Branch**: Enables parallel development with isolated draft versions.
***
## Starting a new version (draft)
You can initiate a new draft (work-in-progress) version while keeping the submitted version intact. A draft version is automatically created under the following circumstances:
* **New Project**: When you create a new project, a corresponding draft version is initiated. This ensures that ongoing changes are tracked separately from the submitted version.

</Frame>
* **New Branch Creation**: The creation of a new branch in the system also triggers the creation of a draft version (from a committed version only). This streamlines the process of branching and development, allowing for parallel progress without impacting the main submitted version.
<Frame>

## Advanced features
### Submitting changes
You can submit changes exclusively on work-in-progress (WIP) versions. Changes can be submitted using the designated action within the version menu. Upon triggering the submission action, a modal window appears, prompting you to provide a commit message.
<Info>
A string of maximum 50 characters, mandatory for submission. Only letters, numbers, and characters \[] () . \_ - / are allowed.
</Info>
The placeholder indicating work-in-progress is replaced with a "submitted" state within the graph view.
#### Updating submit messages
You have the flexibility to modify submit messages after changes are submitted. This can be accomplished using the action available in the version menu.
### Creating a new branch
Using versioning you can work on a stable copy of the project, isolated from ongoing updates by other users. You can create a new branch starting from a specific submit point.
The initiation of new branches is achieved using the dedicated action located in the left menu of the chosen submit point (used as the starting point for the branch).
<Warning>
A string of maximum 16 characters, mandatory for branch creation.
</Warning>
### Merging changes
You can incorporate updates made on a secondary branch into the main branch or another secondary branch. To ensure successful merging of changes, adhere to the following criteria:
* You can merge the latest version from a secondary branch into either its direct or indirect parent branch.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/2025-01-28%2015.42.30.gif)
</Frame>
* Upon triggering the merge action, a modal window appears, giving the possibility to make the following selection:
* **Branch**: Displays the branches to which the current branch is a child (direct or indirect).
* **Message**: A string of maximum 50 characters (limited to letters), numbers and the following characters: \[] () . \_ - /.

# Resources
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/resources
Overview of Global and project resources, including their usage, dependencies, promotion, and configuration within the platform.
## Overview
Resources are categorized into **Global Resources** and **Project Resources**. Each type has unique characteristics that define its usage, dependencies, and promotion between environments. Understanding these distinctions ensures efficient project development, management, and deployment.
***
## Global resources
Global Resources are designed for **reuse across multiple projects** or business contexts.
<Info>
These resources are often organized within **libraries**, enabling consistency and efficiency by providing a central repository of shared components.
</Info>
### Key characteristics
* **Reusable**: Common design elements, themes, fonts, and other assets can be used in multiple projects.
* **Independent**: Global Resources exist outside individual projects, making them adaptable across different business cases.
* **No Dependencies**: These resources are not project-specific, making them versatile for broad use cases. Projects can reference libraries without requiring modifications to the core resources.
### Examples
#### Design assets
* **Themes**: Standardized themes for consistent styling.
* **Global Media Library**: Shared images, icons, and other assets.
* **Fonts**: Reusable font families to maintain branding.
#### Plugins
* **Languages**: Language packs or configurations that support multilingual capabilities across projects.
* **Templates**: Notification and document templates managed at a global level.
* **Out-of-Office Settings**: Platform-wide absence management settings.
#### General settings
* **Users**: User accounts and profiles that can be accessed across multiple projects.
* **Roles**: Defined roles that determine user permissions and access levels.
* **Groups**: User groupings that facilitate collective management and permissions.
* **Audit Log**: Logs that track changes and activities within the platform for security and compliance purposes.
#### Libraries
Organized resource containers including **enumerations**, **substitution tags**, and **CMS components** for multi-project use.
### Promotion workflow
* **Library Promotion**: Global Resources within libraries are promoted separately from projects. They are typically **imported into the Designer UI** in target environments as part of their own libraries.
* **Configuration Management**: When libraries are promoted, existing configurations, such as **generic parameters**, are replaced by project-level configurations in the target environment.
***
## Project resources
Project Resources are specific to a **business use case**. Unlike Global Resources, they belong to a single project, allowing for custom configurations and dependencies on libraries.
### Key characteristics
* **Project-Specific**: Tailored to a single project’s needs.
* **Library Dependencies**: Can reference and extend Global Resources.
* **Configurable**: Parameters can be updated in upper environments through environment variables or overrides.
### Examples
1. **Processes**: BPMN workflows customized for the project’s business logic.
2. **CMS Components**: Project-specific enumerations, substitution tags, and media items.
3. **Task Management**:
* **Views**: Configurable interfaces to display task-related data based on process definitions.
* **Hooks**: Users with task management permissions can create hooks to trigger specific process instances, such as sending notifications when events occur.
* **Stages**: Stages that allow task progression through different statuses.
* **Allocation rules**: Define how tasks are assigned to users or teams.
4. **Integration Designer**:
* **Systems**: A system is a collection of resources—endpoints, authentication, and variables—used to define and run integration workflows.
* **Workflows**: A workflow defines a series of tasks and processes to automate system integrations. Within the Integration Designer, workflows can be configured using different components to ensure efficient data exchange and process orchestration.
5. **Configuration Parameters**: Project-specific rendering settings like `applicationUuid`, `locale`, `language`, and `process parameters`.
6. **Project Builds**: Builds represent finalized versions of the project, including all associated metadata and linked library versions.
7. **Project Settings**: Configure various aspects of a project like platform type, default theme, formatting, etc.
### Promotion workflow
* **Build-Based Promotion**: Only **builds** (not commits) are promoted.
* **Design Asset Handling**: Referenced assets are created if missing but are not updated during import.
* **Configuration Parameters Overrides**: Environment variables replace default values in upper environments.

# Active policy
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/runtime/active-policy
The Active policy defines the strategy for selecting which build version of a project is active in the runtime environment.
This feature plays a key role in ensuring that the correct [**project**](../managing-applications/application) configuration is executed, managing how processes interact with specific builds, and controlling how changes propagate through environments. The active policy determines which project version is currently "live" and dictates how updates and new builds are adopted.
#### Key Concepts
1. **Active Build**
* The active build is the currently selected version of a project that is deployed in the runtime environment. It is the version that all process executions will reference when initiated.
* Only one build can be active per environment at a time, ensuring clarity and stability.
2. **Policy Types**
* **Draft Policy**: Configures the project to run the latest draft version. This is useful for environments like development or testing, where ongoing changes need to be reflected in real-time without committing to a finalized version.
* **Fixed Version Policy**: Points to a specific, committed build version of the project. This policy ensures that no unexpected updates are introduced and is typically used for UAT and Production environments.
3. **Version Control and Flexibility**
* Active Policy provides flexibility by allowing the user to switch between different build versions based on the environment's needs. This makes it easy to test, stage, and deploy without affecting production stability.
* By managing the policy, you control which changes go live and when, allowing for seamless testing and controlled rollouts.
#### Workflow for Managing Active Policy
1. **Setting the Active Policy**
* Navigate to the project's settings in the FlowX.AI Designer.
* Go to the **Active Policy** section, where you can manage the behavior of the active build.
* Choose the policy type—either Draft or Fixed Version—to specify how builds should be managed in the environment.
2. **Managing Draft Policy**
* When selecting the Draft Policy, the project will always refer to the latest draft build created on the chosen branch.
* This allows for continuous development and testing without having to commit to a specific version. However, it is important to use this policy only in non-production environments.
3. **Selecting a Fixed Version Policy**
* For stability, you can set the active policy to a Fixed Version. This locks the project to a specific build, ensuring that no changes are applied unless a new build is created and explicitly set as active.
* This policy is ideal for UAT, QA, and Production environments where stability and consistency are key.
4. **Publishing a New Build as Active**
* Once a new build is ready and verified, you can update the active policy to point to the new build version.
* The change takes effect immediately, making the new build the active version for all processes and interactions in that environment.
#### Key Features
1. **Environment-Specific Control**
* Each environment (Development, UAT, Production) can have its own active policy, providing control over what version of the project is running in each stage of the development lifecycle.
2. **Rollback Capability**
* The active policy makes it easy to revert to a previous build if needed. By simply changing the active policy, you can switch back to an earlier stable version, minimizing disruption.
3. **Branch-Specific Management**
* Active Policy supports management by branch. This means you can maintain different policies for different branches, allowing separate versions of the project to be active in separate environments.
4. **Process Consistency**
* By defining which build version is active, the active policy ensures that all processes reference the correct resources. This eliminates inconsistencies and ensures that the expected behavior is maintained throughout the project's lifecycle.
#### Benefits
* **Controlled Rollouts**: Provides a clear pathway to manage when updates go live, ensuring that no untested changes accidentally reach production.
* **Simplified Management**: Offers a straightforward way to manage the complexity of multiple project versions across various environments.
* **Enhanced Stability**: Reduces the risk of runtime errors by maintaining control over the specific version that is active.
* **Efficient Testing**: Allows for easy testing of new changes without affecting the stability of other environments by using Draft Policy.
#### Managing Active Policy
1. **Configuring a New Active Policy**
* In the project settings, navigate to the **Active Policy** tab.
* Choose between **Draft** or **Fixed Version**.
* If selecting Fixed Version, pick the specific build from the dropdown list.
2. **Changing the Active Build**
* To update which build is active, modify the policy to reference a new build.
* Confirm the changes to activate the selected build in the runtime environment.
3. **Branch Management**
* Use branches to manage draft builds independently. Each branch can have its own active policy, which allows parallel development without interference.
#### Technical Details
1. **Project Context and Resource References**
* The active policy is closely tied to the project context. It determines how resource references are handled during process execution.
* At runtime, the system identifies the active build based on the policy, ensuring that the correct resource definitions are used.
2. **Metadata and Versioning**
* Each active policy includes metadata about the selected build, including build ID, version tags, and branch references. This metadata helps track which version is running in each environment.
3. **Interaction with Runtime Environment**
* The runtime environment relies on the active policy to decide which build version of a project to execute. This is managed through an internal reference that points to the active build.
4. **Storage and Management**
* The active policy is stored separately from the build data, making it easy to update the active build without modifying the build itself. This separation ensures that changes to the active state do not affect the integrity of the builds.
#### Example Use Case
Imagine you have a project in production, and a new feature is developed. You:
* Use a **Draft Policy** to test the new feature in a development environment, pointing to the latest draft build.
* Once the feature is verified, create a build and switch the environment's active policy to a **Fixed Version**, ensuring that the feature is consistent and stable.
* In case a problem arises, you can easily revert the active policy to a previous build version without any reconfiguration.
#### Conclusion
The Active Policy feature in FlowX AI provides a flexible and reliable way to manage which version of a project is running in each environment. It offers a clear structure for testing, deployment, and rollback, making it a vital tool for maintaining stability and consistency throughout the project's lifecycle.

# Process instance
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/runtime/active-process/process-instance
A process instance is a specific execution of a business process that is defined on the FlowX.AI platform. Once a process definition is added to the platform, it can be executed, monitored, and optimized by creating an instance of the definition.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/proc_inst.png)
</Frame>
## Overview
Once the desired processes are defined in the platform, they are ready to be used. Each time a process needs to be used, for example each time a customer wants to request a new credit card, a new instance of the specified process definition is started in the platform. Think of the process definition as a blueprint for a house, and of the process instance as each house of that type being built.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/process_instance_fin.png)
</Frame>
The **FlowX.AI Engine** is responsible for executing the steps in the process definition and handling all the business logic. The token represents the current position in the process and moves from one node to the next based on the sequences and rules defined in the exclusive gateways. In the case of parallel gateways, child tokens are created and eventually merged back into the parent token.
Kafka events are used for communication between FLOWX.AI components such as the engine and integrations/plugins. Each event type is associated with a Kafka topic to track and orchestrate the messages sent on Kafka. The engine updates the UI by sending messages through sockets.
<Card title="More about Kafka" href="../../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts" />
## Checking the Process Status
To check the status of a process or troubleshoot a failed process, follow these steps:
1. Open **FlowX.AI Designer**.
2. Go to **Processes → Active Process → Process instances**.
3. Click **Process status** icon.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/process/process_status.png)
</Frame>
## Understanding the Process Status data
Understanding the various elements within process status data is crucial. Here's what each component entails:
* The **Status** field indicates the state of the process instance, offering distinct values:
| Status         | Indicates the state of the process instance. Offers distinct values:                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CREATED**    | Visible if there's an error during process creation. Displays as `STARTED` if there were no errors during creation.                         |
| **STARTED**    | Indicates the current running status of the process.                                                                                        |
| **DISMISSED**  | Available for processes with subprocesses, seen when a user halts a subprocess.                                                             |
| **EXPIRED**    | This status appears when the defined "expiryTime" expression in the process definition elapses since the process was initiated (`STARTED`). |
| **FINISHED**   | Signifies successful completion of the process execution.                                                                                   |
| **TERMINATED** | Implies a termination request has been sent to the instance.                                                                                |
| **ON HOLD**    | Marks a state where the process is no longer editable.                                                                                      |
| **FAILED**     | Occurs if a CronJob triggers at a specific hour, and the instance isn't finished by then.                                                   |
* **Active process instance**: The UUID of the process instance, with a copy action available.
* **Variables**: Displayed as an expanded JSON.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/process_variables_new.png)
</Frame>
* **Tokens**: A token represents the state within the process instance and describe the current position in the process flow.

## Starting a new process instance
To start a new process instance, a request must be made to the [FlowX.AI Engine](../../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine). This is handled by the web/mobile application. The current user must have the appropriate role/permission to start a new process instance.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/process/process_instance_diagram.png)
</Frame>
To be able to start a new process instance, the current user needs to have the appropriate role/permissions:
<Card title="Configuring access roles for processes" href="../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-access-roles-for-processes" />
When starting a new process instance, we can also set it to [inherit some values from a previous process instance](../../../platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine#orchestration).
## Troubleshooting possible errors
If everything is configured correctly, the new process instance should be visible in the UI and added to the database. However, if you encounter issues, here are some common error messages and their possible solutions:
Possible errors include:
| Error Message                                                      | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *"Process definition not found."*                                  | The process definition with the requested name was not set as published.                         |
| *"Start node for process definition not found."*                   | The start node was not properly configured.                                                      |
| *"Multiple start nodes found, but start condition not specified."* | Multiple start nodes were defined, but the start condition to choose the start node was not set. |
| *"Some mandatory params are missing."*                             | Some parameters set as mandatory were not included in the start request.                         |
| `HTTP code 403 - Forbidden`                                        | The current user does not have the process access role for starting that process.                |
| `HTTP code 401 - Unauthorized`                                     | The current user is not logged in.                                                               |
# Builds
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/runtime/builds
The Build feature allows for the creation of deployable packages of a project, encapsulating all its resources into a single unit.
A build is a snapshot of a specific project version, packaged and prepared for deployment to a runtime environment. The concept of builds plays a crucial role in ensuring that the correct version of a project, with all its configurations and dependencies, runs consistently across different environments (e.g., Dev, UAT, Production).
#### Key concepts
1. **Project Version vs. Build**
* **Project Version** is the editable snapshot of a project's state at a specific point in time. It contains all the resources (like processes, integrations, templates, etc.) and configurations grouped within the project.
* A **Build** is the deployable package of a project version. It is the compiled and immutable state that contains all the project resources transformed into executable components for the runtime environment.
2. **Single Version Rule**
* A build can only represent a single version of a project. If you have multiple versions of a project, each one can have a unique build. This ensures that you can clearly manage which version of the project is running in a specific environment without conflicts.
3. **Consistency and Deployment**
* Builds ensure that when you deploy a project to a different environment (like moving from Dev to UAT), the exact configuration, processes, templates, integrations, and all associated resources remain consistent.
* Builds are immutable—once created, a build cannot be altered. Any updates require creating a new version of the project and generating a new build.
#### Creating a build
1. **Develop the Project**
* First, work on the project in the Config mode. This involves creating processes, adding resources, and configuring integrations. Multiple versions of the project can be created and saved as drafts.
2. **Submit Changes to Version**
* When the project is ready for deployment, submit the changes to create a specific version of the project. This step involves finalizing the current configuration, grouping all resources and changes, and marking them under a specific version ID.
3. **Generate a Build**
* In the project settings, select the version you want to deploy and generate a build. This step compiles the selected project version into a package, converting all the resource definitions into executable components for the runtime environment.
* You can specify build metadata such as version tags, which help identify and manage builds during deployment.
4. **Publish the Build**
* Once the build is generated, it can be published. The published build is now available for execution in the chosen runtime environment, making it the active version that responds to process and integration calls.
#### Key features
1. **Immutability**
* Builds are immutable, ensuring that once a build is created, it reflects a fixed state of the project. This immutability prevents accidental changes and ensures consistency.
2. **Checksum and Integrity**
* Each build includes a checksum or identifier to verify its integrity. This ensures that the deployed build matches the expected configuration and no changes have been made post-build.
3. **Runtime Dependency**
* The runtime environment relies on builds to determine the active project configuration. This means the runtime does not directly interact with the editable project versions but uses builds to maintain stability and reliability.
4. **Version Control**
* Builds are version-controlled, and each build corresponds to a specific project version. This means you can trace exactly which project configuration is active in a particular environment at any time.
#### Benefits
* **Consistency Across Environments**: Builds ensure that the same version of an project runs in different environments, avoiding discrepancies between development and production.
* **Reduced Errors**: Immutable builds reduce the risk of runtime errors caused by unexpected changes.
* **Simplified Rollbacks**: If an issue is detected with a current build, previous builds can be deployed seamlessly, providing an efficient rollback strategy.
* **Streamlined Deployment**: Builds allow for a straightforward deployment process, reducing the complexity of transferring configurations and resources between environments.
#### Build management
1. **Creating a Build**
* Go to the project settings.
* Select the project version you want to deploy.
* Click the **Create Build** button and follow the prompts to configure build settings, including adding metadata or tags.
2. **Viewing and Managing Builds**
* Access the list of builds for a specific project through the Builds section.
* Each build entry provides details like version number, creation date, creator, and status (e.g., Draft, Published).
3. **Publishing a Build**
* Once a build is verified and ready, publish it to make it the active build in the desired environment.
* Only one build can be active per environment at any given time.
#### Technical details
1. **Manifest and Metadata**
* Each build contains a manifest that lists all the resources included, their version IDs, and their resource definitions.
* Metadata helps identify which project version the build is derived from, providing traceability.
2. **Separation of Design and Runtime**
* Builds serve as a bridge between the design (config) view and the runtime view. The config view is where changes are made and managed, while the runtime view uses builds to execute stable, tested versions of projects.
3. **Storage**
* Builds are stored in a dedicated storage system to ensure they are separate from the editable project versions. This storage supports easy retrieval and deployment of builds.
#### Example use case
Imagine you have a project for customer onboarding with multiple processes, templates, and integrations. After completing development and final testing, you:
* Submit changes to create **Version 1.0** of the project.
* Create a build for **Version 1.0**.
* Deploy this build to the UAT environment for final stakeholder review.
* If any adjustments are needed, you go back to the project, make changes, and submit them as **Version 1.1**.
* Create a new build for **Version 1.1**, ensuring that the changes are encapsulated separately from the previous version.
Once everything is approved, you can publish **Version 1.1 Build** to the Production environment, ensuring all environments are aligned without manual reconfiguration.
#### Conclusion
The Build feature is essential for managing projects across multiple environments. It provides a clear and organized pathway from development to deployment, ensuring consistency, integrity, and stability throughout the project's lifecycle.
# Configuration parameters overrides
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/runtime/configuration-parameters-overrides
The Configuration parameters overrides feature allows you to set environment-specific values for certain parameters within a project.
This features enables flexibility and customization, making it possible to tailor a project’s behavior and integration settings according to the needs of each environment (e.g., Dev, UAT, Production). By defining overrides, users can easily manage variables like API endpoints, authentication tokens, environment-specific URLs, and other settings without altering the core project configuration.
#### Key concepts
1. **Configuration Parameters**
* Configuration parameters are placeholders used throughout a project to store key settings and values. These parameters can include anything from URLs, API keys, and credentials to integration-specific details.
* Parameters can be defined at the project level and referenced throughout processes, business rules, integrations, and templates.
<Info>
If an override is needed for a configuration parameter defined in a library, it must be applied within the project where the library is used as a dependency. This ensures a clear distinction between library defaults and project-specific configurations while maintaining flexibility.
Overrides applied in a project take precedence over the values defined in the library.
</Info>
2. **Environment Overrides**
* Overrides are specific values assigned to configuration parameters for a particular environment. This ensures that an project behaves appropriately for each environment without requiring changes to the project itself.
* Each environment (Development, UAT, Production) can have a unique set of overrides that replace the default parameter values when the project is deployed.
3. **Variable Precedence**
* Process Variables Override Configuration Parameters:
* If a process variable and a configuration parameter share the same name, the process variable takes precedence at runtime.
* If the process variable is null or undefined, the configuration parameter’s value is used as a fallback.
* Best Practice: Avoid naming process variables the same as configuration parameters to prevent unexpected overrides or conflicts.
4. **Centralized Management**
* Configuration parameters and their overrides are managed centrally within the project’s settings. This allows for quick adjustments and a clear overview of how each environment is configured.
#### Workflow for managing Configuration parameter overrides
1. **Defining Configuration Parameters**
* Go to the project settings and navigate to the **Configuration Parameters** section.
* Define parameters that will be used across the project, such as:
* **CRM URL**: Base URL for CRM integration.
* **API Key**: Secure key for external service authentication.
* **Environment URL**: Different base URLs for various environments (Dev, UAT, Production).
2. **Setting Up Environment-Specific Overrides**
* Access the **Overrides** section for configuration parameters.
* For each environment (e.g., Dev, UAT), assign specific values to the defined parameters. For example:
* Dev Environment: `CRM_URL` → `https://dev.crm.example.com`
* UAT Environment: `CRM_URL` → `https://uat.crm.example.com`
* Save the environment-specific overrides. These values will take precedence over the default settings when deployed in that environment.
3. **Applying Overrides at Runtime**
* When a project is deployed to a specific environment, the system automatically applies the relevant overrides.
* Overrides ensure that the configuration aligns with environment-specific requirements, like endpoint adjustments or security settings, without altering the core setup.
#### Key features
1. **Flexibility Across Environments**
* Easily adjust configuration parameters without changing the core application, ensuring that the project adapts to the target environment seamlessly.
2. **Centralized Parameter Management**
* Configuration parameters and their environment-specific overrides are managed centrally within the project settings, providing a single source of truth.
3. **Dynamic Integration Adaptation**
* Environment-specific overrides allow integrations to connect to different endpoints or use different credentials based on the environment, supporting a smoother development-to-production workflow.
4. **Improved Security**
* Sensitive data, such as API keys or credentials, can be stored as environment-specific overrides, ensuring that development and testing environments do not share the same sensitive values as production.
5. **Avoid Variable Naming Conflicts**
* Best Practice: Use distinct names for process variables and configuration parameters to avoid unintentional overrides. If process variables are undefined or null, they will default to the corresponding configuration parameter’s value.
#### Benefits
* **Simplified Deployment**: Overrides eliminate the need for manual configuration changes during deployment, streamlining the process and reducing the risk of errors.
* **Environment Consistency**: Each environment can have its own tailored settings, ensuring consistent behavior and performance across all stages.
* **Secure Configuration**: Overrides keep sensitive parameters isolated to the appropriate environments, enhancing security and minimizing the risk of exposure.
* **Ease of Maintenance**: Centralized management of parameters and overrides simplifies adjustments when changes are needed, minimizing maintenance overhead.
#### Managing Configuration parameters overrides
1. **Creating a Parameter**
* In the project settings, navigate to the **Configuration Parameters** section.
* Define a new parameter by specifying its name, type, and default value.
* This parameter will be used as a placeholder throughout the project, referenced in processes, templates, and integrations.
2. **Assigning Overrides**
* Access the **Overrides** tab for the configuration parameters.
* Choose the environment (e.g., Dev, UAT, Production) and assign a specific override value for each parameter.
* Confirm the changes to apply the overrides for the selected environment.
3. **Viewing and Editing Overrides**
* From the project’s settings, you can review all environment-specific overrides in one place.
* Edit existing overrides or add new ones as needed to adapt to changes in environment requirements.
#### Technical details
1. **Parameter Resolution at Runtime**
* During runtime, the system retrieves the active configuration parameters for the project. If overrides are set for the environment, they replace the default values.
* This resolution ensures that the correct parameters are used, based on the environment in which the application is running.
2. **Integration with Business Rules and Processes**
* Configuration parameters can be directly referenced in business rules and processes. Overrides ensure that these references point to the correct environment-specific values during execution.
3. **Storage and Management**
* Configuration parameters and their overrides are stored centrally, and the values are retrieved dynamically during runtime. This centralized approach ensures that updates to parameters are automatically reflected in the application without needing a new build.
#### Example use case
Imagine you have an application that integrates with a third-party CRM system. You:
* Define a `CRM_URL` parameter with a default value for the development environment.
* Create overrides for UAT and Production environments with their respective URLs.
* When the application is deployed to the UAT environment, the system automatically uses the UAT-specific CRM URL for all integration points without changing the project’s core configuration.
* When it's time to deploy to Production, the system uses the production-specific overrides, ensuring that the application connects to the right CRM instance.
# Scheduled processes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/projects/runtime/scheduled-processes
Automate the initiation of process instances using predefined timer settings. Scheduled Processes trigger new process instances on specific dates, times, or intervals without manual intervention. A scheduler is generated for the published version of any process started by a Start Timer Event nodes.
## Overview
The **Scheduled Processes** feature automatically triggers process instances using Timer Start Events. In the **Runtime** tab, you can view scheduled processes and activate/deactivate timers without a redeployment. This feature is especially useful in upper environments, where you might need to pause or resume cron jobs without modifying the project build.

<Warning>
**Looking ahead**: Python 2.7 support will be deprecated in FlowX.AI 5.0. We recommend migrating your Python scripts to Python 3 to take advantage of improved performance and modern language features.
</Warning>
<Info>
By default, FlowX.AI uses Python 2.7 (Jython) for script execution. Python 3 support is available but must be explicitly enabled. See [Configuring script engine](/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-script-engine) example for more details.

## JavaScript
<Info>
**New in v4.7.1**: JavaScript support has been upgraded from Nashorn (ECMAScript 5.1) to GraalJS (ECMAScript 15/2024), providing significantly improved performance and modern language features.
</Info>
JavaScript in FlowX.AI is powered by GraalJS, which supports ECMAScript 15 (2024) standards. This provides modern JavaScript capabilities for your business rules and integrations.
### What is GraalJS?
GraalJS is an ECMAScript compliant JavaScript implementation built on GraalVM. It supports the latest ECMAScript features and offers high performance through the GraalVM's JIT compiler.
### Properties
* Supports ECMAScript 15 (2024) features including modern syntax and APIs
* Provides consistent scripting across business rules and integration designer
* Runs in a secure sandboxed environment
### Limitations
JavaScript scripts run in a sandboxed environment. Here is a list of JavaScript features not available in the sandbox:
* import.meta (ES2020)
* top-level await (ES2022)
* set operations (ES2024)
* Array.fromAsync (ES2024)
### Useful links

***
## Python 3
<Info>
**Important Configuration Note**: Python 2.7 (Jython) is the default Python runtime in FlowX.AI. To enable Python 3 via GraalPy, you must set the feature toggle `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM` to `true` in the [**Process Engine configuration**](/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup) and in the AI Developer agent configuration. If this configuration variable is missing or set to `false`, Python 2.7 will be used.
</Info>
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. FlowX.AI uses Python 3.11.7 via GraalPy for executing Python scripts.
### What is GraalPy?
GraalPy is an implementation of Python that runs on the GraalVM. It offers high compatibility with standard Python (CPython) while providing the ability to run within the Java ecosystem. GraalPy supports Python 3 and provides access to a large subset of the standard Python library.

## Groovy
Groovy is a multi-faceted language for the Java platform. The language can be used to combine Java modules, extend existing Java applications and write new applications
We use and recommend **Groovy 3.0.21** version, using **groovy-jsr223** engine.
<Info>
**Groovy** has multiple ways of integrating with Java, some of which provide richer options than available with **JSR-223** (e.g. greater configurability and more security control). **JSR-223** is recommended when you need to keep the choice of language used flexible and you don't require integration mechanisms not supported by **JSR-223**.
</Info>
<Info>
**JSR-223** (spec) is **a standard scripting API for Java Virtual Machine (JVM) languages** . The JVM languages provide varying levels of support for the JSR-223 API and interoperability with the Java runtime.

# Token
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/token
Token is the concept that describes the current position in the process flow. When you start the process you have a graph of nodes and based on the configuration you will go from one to another based on the defined sequence (connection between nodes).
The token is a [BPMN](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn) concept that represents a state within a process instance. It keeps track of the current position in the process flow and is used to store data related to the current process instance state.
A token is created each time a new process instance is started. As the actions on the process instance are executed, the token advances from one node to the next. As a node can have several [actions](./actions/actions) that need to be executed, the token is also used for keeping track of the actions executed in each node.
In case of [parallel gateways](./node/parallel-gateway), child tokens are created for each flow branch. The parent token moves to the gateway sync node and only advances after all the child tokens also reach that node.
The image below shows how a token advances through a process flow:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/image%20%28140%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.png)
</Frame>
The token will only move to the next node when there are no more mandatory actions from the current node that need to be executed. The token will also wait on a node in case the node is set to receive an event from an external system through Kafka.
There will be cases when the token needs to be stopped in a node until some input is received from the user. If the input from the user is needed for further advancing in the process, the token should only advance after all data was received. A mandatory manual action can be used in this case and linked to the user action. This way we make sure that the process flow advances only after the user input is received.
## Checking the token status
The current process instance status can be retrieved using the FlowX Designer. It will display some info on the tokens related to that process instance and the current nodes they are in.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/check_token_status.png)
In case more details are needed about the token, you can click the **Process status** view button, choose a token then click the **view button** again:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/token_view_button.gif)
## Token details
* **Token status**: Describes the state of the token in the process.
* **Status Current Node**: Describes the token status in the current node.
* **Retry**: After correcting the errors, you can hit Retry and see if the token moves on.
* **See Token status**: Opens a modal displaying a detailed view of the token status.

# FlowX.AI Advancing Controller
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/advancing-controller
The Advancing Controller is a support service for the FlowX.AI Engine that enhances the efficiency of advancing operations. It facilitates equal distribution and redistribution of the workload during scale-up and scale-down scenarios.
To achieve its functionality, the Advancing Controller microservice utilizes database triggers in both PostgreSQL and OracleDB configurations.
<Info>
A database trigger is a function that is automatically executed whenever specific events, such as inserts, updates, or deletions, occur in the database.
</Info>
## Usage
The Advancing Controller service is responsible for managing and optimizing the advancement process in the PostgreSQL or OracleDB databases. It ensures efficient workload distribution, performs cleanup tasks, and monitors the status of worker pods.
If a worker pod fails, the service reassigns its work to other pods to prevent [**process instances**](../../projects/runtime/active-process/process-instance) from getting stuck.
<Check>
It is essential to have the Advancing Controller service running alongside the FlowX Engine for uninterrupted instance advancement.
</Check>
<Tip>
It is important to ensure that both the FlowX Engine and the Advancing Controller microservices are up and running concurrently for optimal performance.
</Tip>
## Configuration
For detailed instructions on how to set up the Advancing Controller microservice, refer to the following guide:
<Card title="Advancing controller setup guide" href="../../../setup-guides/advancing-controller-setup-guide" />
# FlowX.AI Events Gateway
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/events-gateway
The FlowX Events Gateway is a service that centralizes the communication with Server-Sent Events (SSE) messages from Backend to Frontend.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/events_gateway_archi.png)
</Frame>
The FlowX Events Gateway serves as a central component for handling and distributing events within the system:
<CardGroup>
<Card title="Event processing" icon="gears" href="#event-processing" />
<Card title="Message distribution" icon="stack-exchange" href="#stack-exchange" />
<Card title="Event publication" icon="tower-broadcast" href="#tower-broadcast" />
<Card title="Integration with Redis" icon="network-wired" href="#network-wired" />
</CardGroup>
### Event processing
The Events Gateway system is responsible for receiving and processing events from various sources, such as the [**FlowX Engine**](./flowx-engine) and [**Task Management**](../core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview). It acts as an intermediary between these systems and the rest of the system components.
<Tip>
It is a reusable component and is also used in administration scenarios to provide feedback without a refresh—for example, [**misconfigurations**](../../../../release-notes/v4.1.0-may-2024/v4.1.0-may-2024#misconfigurations) in  platform version 4.1, allowing an error to be displayed in real-time during configuration.
</Tip>
### Message distribution
The Events Gateway system reads messages from the Kafka topic (`messaging_events_topic`) and distributes them to relevant components within the system. It ensures that the messages are appropriately routed to the intended recipients for further processing.
### Event publication
The Events Gateway system plays a crucial role in publishing events to the frontend renderer (FE renderer). It communicates with the frontend renderer using `HTTP` via `WebFlux`. By publishing events, it enables real-time updates and notifications on the user interface, keeping the user informed about the progress and changes in the system.
It is designed to efficiently send updates to the frontend in the following scenarios:
* When reaching a specific [**User Task (UT)**](../../building-blocks/node/user-task-node), a notification is sent to ensure the corresponding screen is rendered promptly.
* When specific actions require data to be sent to the user interface from a node.
### Integration with Redis
<Info>
[**Redis**](../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-redis) plays an important role within the platform. It handles every message and is mandatory for the platform to function correctly, especially with the frontend. The platform relies on Redis to ensure that the messages are distributed efficiently and that the correct instance with the SSE connection pointer for the recipient is always reached.
</Info>
The events-gateway system also interacts with Redis to publish events on a stream. This allows other components in the system to consume the events from the Redis stream and take appropriate actions based on the received events.
In these situations, the FlowX Engine places a message on Kafka for the Events Gateway. The Events Gateway then retrieves the message and stores it in Redis.
In summary, the events-gateway system acts as a hub for event processing, message distribution, and event publication within the system. It ensures efficient communication and coordination between various system components, facilitating real-time updates and maintaining system consistency.
For more details about how to configure events-gateway microservice, check the following section:
<Card title="Events gateway configuration" href="../../../setup-guides/events-gateway-setup" />
# FlowX.AI Engine
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine
The engine is the core of the platform, it is the service that runs instances of the process definitions, generates UI, communicates with the frontend and also with custom integrations and plugins. It keeps track of all currently running process instances and makes sure the process flows run correctly.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Engine%20Diagram%20%281%29.png)
</Frame>
## Orchestration
Creating and interacting with process instances is pretty straightforward, as most of the interaction happens automatically and is handled by the engine.
The only points that need user interaction are starting the process and executing user tasks on it (for example when a user fills in a form on the screen and saves the results).
<Card title="FlowX Engine setup guide" href="../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/" icon="files" />
# FlowX.AI Audit
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/audit
The Audit service provides a centralized location for all audit events. The following details are available for each event.
* **Timestamp** - the date and time the event occurred, the timestamp is displayed in a reversed chronologically order
* **User** - the entity who initiated the event, could be a username or a system

# Configuration parameters
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/configuration-parameters
Configuration parameters allow projects to be dynamic, flexible, and environment-specific. They enable managing variables and values that change across deployment environments (e.g., Development, QA, Production), without requiring hardcoded updates. This feature is particularly valuable for managing sensitive information, environment-specific settings, and configurations for integrations.
<Info>
Configuration Parameters are defined per **project version** or **library version**, ensuring consistency across builds while allowing for environment-specific overrides. These parameters can be used across various components, such as business rules, UI elements, integration designer, and gateways.
Libraries can define configuration parameters to facilitate testing of processes or workflows that depend on them. However, unlike project-level configuration parameters, libraries do not support direct overrides.
* Libraries provide default values for configuration parameters.
* Projects using these libraries can override the provided values as required.
</Info>

</Frame>
***
## Default and override values
* **Default Value**: Defined during parameter creation and included in the application build. It serves as the fallback value when no environment-specific override is set.
* **Override Value**: A value defined post-deployment for a specific environment. Overrides take precedence during runtime.
* **Precedence Behavior** (process variables override):
* If a process variable and a configuration parameter share the same name, the process variable's value takes precedence during runtime.
* If the process variable is null or undefined, the configuration parameter's value is used as a fallback.
* Process variables override configuration parameters unless the process variable is `null` or undefined, in which case the configuration parameter is used.
* **Subprocess Behavior**:
* When a value is passed to a subprocess, the subprocess uses the resolved value (process variable or configuration parameter) from the parent process.
* If a new value is defined within the subprocess, it is appended back to the parent process.
<Tip>
To avoid conflicts, use distinct names for process variables and generic parameters whenever possible.
</Tip>
<Info>
**Exception in Business Rules**:\
In business rules, values are taken directly from the map of configuration parameters without applying the above fallback logic.
</Info>
For details on configuring runtime overrides, see:
<Card title="Configuration Parameters Overrides" href="../../projects/runtime/configuration-parameters-overrides" icon="file" />
***
## Types of configuration parameters
Configuration parameters are defined as **key-value pairs** and support the following types:
### Value
A static value directly used by the project. Suitable for settings that do not change across environments.
* **Use Cases**:
* Feature flags to toggle functionality (e.g., enabling/disabling insurance sales in a customer dashboard).
* Email addresses for notification recipients.
* Homebank redirect URLs for specific processes.
* **Example**:
* **Key**: `officeEmail`
* **Type**: `value`
* **Value**: `officeEmail@office.com`

</Frame>
***
### Environment variable
References an external variable set by the DevOps team. These variables are defined per environment and referenced using a **name convention**.
* **Use Cases**:
* Environment-specific API base URLs.
* Dynamic configuration of services or integrations.
* **Example**:
* **Key**: `baseUrl`
* **Type**: `environment variable`
* **Value**: `BASE_URL` (name convention pointing to an externally defined value)
Configuration details:
| Key     | Type                   | Value      | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| baseUrl | `environment variable` | `BASE_URL` | A reference to the base URL configured externally by DevOps. |
**Example values for different environments**
| Environment | External Variable Name | Actual Value                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Development | `BASE_URL`             | `https://dev.example.com/api` |
| QA          | `BASE_URL`             | `https://qa.example.com/api`  |
| Production  | `BASE_URL`             | `https://api.example.com`     |
***
### Secret environment variable
Used for sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or credentials. These values are securely managed by DevOps and referenced using a **name convention**.
* **Use Cases**:
* Passwords or tokens for integrations.
* Secure configuration of external services in the integration designer.
* **Example**:
* **Key**: `dbPassword`
* **Type**: `secret environment variable`
* **Value**: `DB_PASSWORD`
***
## Use cases for configuration parameters
Configuration parameters simplify the management of environment-specific or dynamic settings across multiple project components:
1. **Business Rules**:
* Define dynamic logic based on parameters such as feature toggles or environment-specific conditions.
2. **UI Elements**:
* Configure content dynamically based on the environment (e.g., URLs for redirects, conditional features).
* **Note**: Ensure variables referenced in UI components (e.g., for dynamic content or URLs) are uniquely named to avoid unexpected overrides by process variables.
3. **Integration Designer**:
* Reference the token parameter.

</Frame>
4. **Gateways**:
* Dynamically manage routing and decision-making logic using environment-specific parameters.
## Adding a configuration parameter
To add a new configuration parameter:
1. Navigate to **Your Project** → **Configuration Parameters**.
2. Click **New Parameter** and provide the following:
* **Key**: Name of the parameter.
* **Type**: Select `value`, `environment variable`, or `secret environment variable`.
* **Value**:
* For `value`: Enter the static value.
* For `environment variable` or `secret environment variable`: Enter the agreed name convention.
3. Click **Save** to include the parameter in the application build.

***
## Technical notes and best practices
### Security
* **Sensitive Values (ENV\_SECRET)**:
* Store and manage securely.
* Do not display in the frontend or expose via public APIs.
* Avoid logging sensitive information.
### Environment-specific updates
* Environment variable updates (`ENV`/`ENV_SECRET`) are managed by DevOps.
* Updates may require service restarts unless a caching or real-time mechanism (e.g., change streams) is implemented.
### Reserved keys
* Certain keys are reserved for system use (e.g., `processInstanceId`). Avoid using reserved keys for custom configurations.
### Variable naming
* **Avoid Shared Names**:
* Do not use the same name for configuration parameters and process variables to prevent unintentional overrides.
* **Fallback Logic Awareness**:
* Understand that `null` or `undefined` process variables will default to the corresponding configuration parameter's value during runtime.
* **Subprocess Behavior**:
* Variables in subprocesses are appended back to parent processes with their current state. Plan naming conventions and data flows accordingly.
<Warning>
When designing processes, ensure that variables in subprocesses and parent processes do not conflict with configuration parameters names. Test these interactions in scenarios where variables are dynamically assigned or left undefined.

# FlowX.AI CMS
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/content-management
The FlowX.AI Headless Content Management System (CMS) is a core component of the FlowX.AI platform, designed to enhance the platform's capabilities with specialized functionalities for managing taxonomies and diverse content types.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/content_management.png#center)
</Frame>
## Key features
The FlowX.AI CMS offers the following features:
<CardGroup>
<Card title="Enumerations" href="enumerations" icon="list">
Manage and configure enumerations for various content types
</Card>
<Card title="Substitution tags" href="substitution-tags" icon="tags">

</Card>
</CardGroup>
## Deployment and integration
The CMS can be rapidly deployed on your chosen infrastructure, preloaded with necessary taxonomies or content via a REST interface, and integrated with the FlowX Engine using Kafka events.
For deployment and configuration, refer to the:
<Card title="CMS setup guide" href="../../../../setup-guides/cms-setup" icon="files" />
## Using the CMS service
Once the CMS is deployed in your infrastructure, you can define and manage custom content types, such as lists with different values based on external systems, blog posts, and more.
### Kafka integration
You can use Kafka to translate/extract content values based on your defined lanaguages and source systems.
#### Request content
Manage content retrieval messages between the CMS and the FlowX Engine using the following Kafka topics:
| Environment Variable                | Default FLOWX.AI value (Customizable)                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_REQUEST\_CONTENT\_IN  | ai.flowx.dev.plugin.cms.trigger.retrieve.content.v1                |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_REQUEST\_CONTENT\_OUT | ai.flowx.dev.engine.receive.plugin.cms.retrieve.content.results.v1 |
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_REQUEST_CONTENT_IN`: This variable defines the topic used by the CMS to listen for incoming content retrieval requests.
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_REQUEST_CONTENT_OUT`: This variable defines the topic where the CMS sends the results of content retrieval requests back to the FlowX Engine.
<Tip>
You can find the defined topics in two ways:
1. In the FlowX.AI Designer: Go to **Platform Status** -> **cms-core-mngt** -> **kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator** -> **Details** -> **Configuration** -> **Topic** -> **Request** -> **Content** (use the `in` topic).
![Kafka Topics in FlowX.AI Designer](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/kafka-translate-cms-topics.png)
2. Alternatively, check the CMS microservice deployment for the `KAFKA_TOPIC_REQUEST_CONTENT_IN` environment variable.
</Tip>
#### Example: Request a label by language or source system code
To translate custom codes into labels using the specified [language](../../plugins/languages.) or [source system](./source-systems), use the following request format. For instance, when extracting values from a specific enumeration for a UI component:
<video controls className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/kakfaa-cms.mp4" />
For example when you want to use a UI component where you want to extract values from an specific enumeration.
<Info>
Various external systems and integrations might use different labels for the same information. In the processes, it is easier to use the corresponding code and translate this into the needed label when necessary: for example when sending data to other integrations, when generating documents, etc.
</Info>
#### Request content request
Add a [**Send Message Task** (kafka send event)](/4.1.x/docs/building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) and configure it to send content requests to the FlowX.AI Engine.
The following values are expected in the request body of your Send Message Taks node:
* At least one of `language` and `sourceSystem` should be defined (if you only need the `sourceSystem` to be translated, you can leave `language` empty and vice versa, but they cannot both be empty)
* A list of `entries` and their `codes` to be translated
**Expected Request Body:**
```json
{
"language": "en",
"sourceSystem": "FlowX",
"entries": [
{
"codes": [
"ROMANIA",
"BAHAMAS"
],
"contentDescription": {
"name": "country", //the name of the enumeration we used in this example
"version": 1, //optional, only if you want to extract from a specific version of your enumeration
"draft": true //optional
}
}
]
}
```
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/kafka-translate-cms.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
The `version` and `draft` fields are optional. If not specified, the latest published content will be used.
</Info>
#### Request content response
Add a **Receive Message Task** to handle the response from the CMS service. Configure it to listen to the topic where the Engine sends the response, e.g., we have the `ai.flowx.updates.contents.values.v1` topic.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/kafka-translate-cms-response.png)
</Frame>
**Response Message Structure**:
```json
{
"entries": [
{
"contentName": "country",
"code": "ROMANIA",
"label": "Romania",
"translatedCode": "ROMANIA-FlowX"
},
{
"contentName": "country",
"code": "BAHAMAS",
"label": "Bahamas",
"translatedCode": "BAHAMAS-FlowX"
}
],
"error": null
}
```
Next, we will change the system language and modify our process to display translations dinamycally on a another key on a separate screen.

# Enumerations
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/enumerations
Enumerations allow you to manage a collection of predefined values that can be used within UI components or templates. These values can be tailored for specific source systems or languages.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-29%20at%2012.36.20.png)
</Frame>
## Overview
Enumerations help you standardize and manage lists of values that are displayed in your applications. Each enumeration consists of one or more values with both an internal identifier (the code) and display strings (labels) for different languages. You can also establish hierarchies by creating child collections—for example, defining states within a country.
## User interface overview
The **Enumerations** tab is divided into the following sections:
### Header
* **New Enumeration** - Click this button to create a new enumeration.
* **Contextual Menu (three dots)** - Provides options for **Import** and **Export**.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-29%20at%2012.53.55.png)
</Frame>
### Main table
* **Name** - Displays the name of each enumeration.
* **Edited At** - Indicates the last update timestamp for each enumeration.
* **View Details** - Allows you to update the enumeration name.
<Frame>

</Frame>
***
## Enumeration entry details
When you open an enumeration entry, define the following properties:
1. **Code** - Not displayed in the end-user interface, but used to assure value uniqueness
2. **Labels** - These are the display strings shown to end users in various languages.
3. **External source systems codes** - Specifies the corresponding codes for each external system that consumes the data. Connectors use these codes for data validation.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/Screenshot%202025-01-29%20at%2013.14.01.png)
</Frame>
### Adding a new enumeration
To create a new enumeration:
1. **Open your project:**  Launch **FlowX Designer** and open your project.
2. **Access Enumerations:** Select **Enumerations** from the **CMS** tab.
3. **Name the Enumeration:** Enter a suggestive name and click **Add**.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/create_new_enum.png)
</Frame>
### Configuring an enumeration
After creating an enumeration, add values to it by configuring:
* **Code:** A unique identifier (not visible to end-users).
* **Labels:** The display string for each language.
* **Source Systems:** The code values assigned for each external system consuming the data.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/enum_add_value.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
You can find the list of available source systems under **Projects → Integrations → Systems**.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/systems.png)
</Frame>
</Info>
### Creating a child collection
Enumerations can be organized hierarchically by defining child values for each entry. For example, you might define states as children under a country enumeration. Hierarchical structures enable cascading selections in the user interface; for instance, choosing a country in one dropdown can filter the states available in another.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/child_enum.png)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/child_enum_example.png)
</Frame>
### Importing/exporting an enumeration
You can import or export enumerations using the following formats:
* **ZIP**
* **CSV**
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/export_import_enums.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
Every enumeration (root or child) must contain at least one **content value** (i.e., at least one label is provided) before attempting an import or export. Remember, the term *value* here refers to the display content for end-users, not the internal code.
</Warning>
### Enumerations example
Consider an example for **Activity Domain Companies**. You can use hierarchies to organize related domains and activities.
#### **Activity Domain Companies → Agriculture forestry and fishing:**
* **Agriculture, hunting, and related services →**
<details>
<summary>Cultivation of non-perennial plants:</summary>
* Cultivation of cereals (excluding rice), leguminous plants and oilseeds
* Cultivation of rice

</Tip>
## Icons
The Icons feature allows you to personalize the icons used in UI elements. By uploading SVG files through the Media Library and marking them, you can choose icons from the available list in the UI Designer.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/icons.png)
<Info>
When selecting icons in the UI Designer, only SVG files marked as icons in the Media Library will be displayed.
</Info>
<Info>
To ensure optimal visual rendering and alignment within your UI elements, it is recommended to use icons with small sizes such as: 16px, 24px, 32px.
Using icons specifically designed for these sizes helps maintain consistency and ensures a visually pleasing user interface. It is advisable to select icons from icon sets that provide these size options or to resize icons proportionally to fit within these dimensions.
<Warning>
Icons are displayed or rendered at their original, inherent size.
</Warning>
</Info>
### Customization
Content-specific icons pertain to the content of UI elements, such as icons for [input fields](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) or [send message buttons](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons). These icons are readily accessible in the [UI Designer](../../../building-blocks/ui-designer/).

Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/substitution-tags
Substitution tags are used to generate dynamic content across the platform. As **enumerations**, substitution tags can be defined for each language set for the solution.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/substitution_tags.png)
</Frame>
On the main screen inside **Substitution tags**, you have the following elements:
* **Key**
* **Values** - strings that are used in the end-user interface, according to the language set for the generated solution
* **Edit** - button used to edit substitution tags
* **Delete** - button used to delete substitution tags
* **New value** - button used to add a new substitution tag
* **Breadcrumbs menu**:
* **Import**
* from JSON
* from CSV
* **Export**
* to JSON
* to CSV
* **Search by** - search function used to easily look for a particular substitution tag
### Adding new substitution tags
To add a new substitution tag, follow the next steps.
1. Go to **FlowX Designer** and select the **Content Management** tab.
2. Select **Substitution tags** from the list.
3. Click **New value**.
4. Fill in the necessary details:
* Key
* Languages
5. Click **Add** after you finish.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/add_new_substitution.png)
<Info>
When working with substitution tags or other elements that imply values from other languages defined in the CMS, when running a **process**, the default values extracted will be the ones marked by the default language.
</Info>
### Getting a substitution tag by key
```
public func getTag(withKey key: String) -> String?
```
All substitution tags will be retrieved by the [**SDK**](../../../../sdks/angular-renderer) before starting the first process and will be stored in memory.
Whenever the container app needs a substitution tag value for populating the UI of the custom components, it can request the substitution tag using the method above, providing the key.
For example, substitution tags can be used to localize the content inside an application.
### Example
#### Localizing the app
<Info>
You must first check and configure the FLOWX.AI Angular renderer to be able to replicate this example. Click [here](../../../../sdks/angular-renderer) for more information.
</Info>
The `flxLocalize` pipe is found in the `FlxLocalizationModule`.
```typescript
import { FlxLocalizationModule } from 'flowx-process-renderer';
```
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
selector: 'app-dummy-component',
template: ` <h3>{{ "stringToLocalize" | flxLocalize}}</h3>`,
})
export class DummyComponent{
stringToLocalize: string = `@@localizedString`
}
```
Strings that need to be localized must have the '**@@**' prefix which the **flxLocalize** pipe uses to extract and replace the string with a value found in the substitution tags enumeration.
Substitution tags are retrieved when a start process call is first made, and it's cached on subsequent start process calls.
# FlowX.AI Scheduler
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/scheduler
The Scheduler is part of the core extensions of the FlowX.AI platform. It can be easily added to your custom FlowX deployment to enhance the core platform capabilities with functionality specific to scheduling messages.
The service offers the possibility to schedule a message that you only need to process after a configured time period.
It can be quickly deployed on the chosen infrastructure and then connected to the **FLOWX.AI Engine** through Kafka events.
## Using the scheduler
After deploying the scheduler service in your infrastructure, you can start using it to schedule messages that you need to process at a later time.
One such example would be to use the scheduler service to expire processes that were started but haven't been finished.
<Warning>
First you need to check the configured kafka topics match the ones configured in the engine deployment.
</Warning>
<Check>
For example the engine topics `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_OUT_SET` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_OUT_STOP` **must** be the same with the ones configured in the scheduler at `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_SET` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_STOP` environment variables.
</Check>
When a process is scheduled to expire, the engine sends the following message to the scheduler service (on the topic `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_SET`):
```json
{
"applicationName": "onboarding",
"applicationId": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00",
"payload": {
"scheduledEventType": "EXPIRE_PROCESS",
"processInstanceUuid": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00"
},
"scheduledTime": 1621412209.353327,
"responseTopicName": "ai.flowx.process.expire.staging"
}
```
The scheduled time should be defined as `java.time.Instant`.
At the scheduled time, the payload will be sent back to the response topic defined in the message, like so:
```json
{
"scheduledEventType": "EXPIRE_PROCESS",
"processInstanceUuid": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00"
}
```
If you don't need the scheduled message anymore, you can discard it by sending the following message (on the topic `KAFKA_TOPIC_SCHEDULE_IN_STOP`)
```json
{
"applicationName": "onboarding",
"applicationId": "04f82408-ee66-4c68-8162-b693b06bba00"
}
```
These fields, `applicationName` and `applicationId` are used to uniquely identify a scheduled message.

# FlowX.AI Data Search
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/search-data-service
The Data Search service is a microservice that enables data searches within processes defined in the current or any other application in the platform. It facilitates the creation of processes capable of conducting searches and retrieving data by utilizing Kafka actions in tandem with Elasticsearch mechanisms.
<Tip>
Data Search service leverages Elasticsearch to execute searches based on indexed keys, using existing mechanisms.
</Tip>
## Using the Data Search service
### Use case
* Search for data within other processes
* Display results indicating where the search key was found in other processes
For our example, two process definitions are necessary:
* one process used to search data in another process - in our example ***"search\_process\_CDN"***
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/search_in_another_proc_34.png)
</Frame>
* one process where we look for data - in our example ***"add\_new\_clients"***
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/search_populate_data.png)
</Frame>
## Add data process example
Firstly, create a process where data will be added. Subsequently, the second process will be used to search for data in this initial process.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/addDataProc.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
In the "Add Data Process Example" it's crucial to note that we add mock data here to simulate existing data within real processes.
</Warning>
Example of MVEL Business Rule:
```json
output.put ("application", {
"date": "22.08.2022",
"client": {
"identificationData": {
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Doe",
"cityOfBirth": "Anytown",
"primaryDocument": {
"number": 123456,
"series": "AB",
"issuedCountry": "USA",
"issuedBy": "Local Authority",
"issuedAt": "01.01.2010",
"type": "ID",
"expiresAt": "01.01.2030"
},
"countryOfBirth": "USA",
"personalIdentificationNumber": "1234567890",
"countyOfBirth": "Any County",
"isResident": true,
"residenceAddress": {
"country": "USA",
"city": "Anytown",
"street": "Main Street",
"streetNumber": 123
},
"mailingAddress": {
"country": "USA",
"city": "Anytown",
"street": "Main Street",
"streetNumber": 123
},
"pseudonym": null
},
}
}
);
```
Now we can play with this process and create some process instances with different states.
## Search process example
Configure the "Search process" to search data in the first created process instances:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create process">
Create a process using the [**Process Designer**](../../building-blocks/process/process).
</Step>
<Step title="Displaying the results (optional)">
Add a [**Task node**](../../building-blocks/node/task-node) within the process. Configure this node and add a business rule if you want to customize the display of results, e.g:
```java
output.put("searchResult", {"result": []});
output.put("resultsNumber", 0);
```
<Tip>
For displaying results in the UI, you can also consider utilizing [**Collections**](../../building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection/) UI element.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Configure the search node">
Add a **user task** and configure a send event using a [**Kafka send action**](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#send-message-task). Configure the following parameters:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Topic name">
The Kafka topic for the search service requests (defined at `KAFKA_TOPIC_DATA_SEARCH_IN` environment variable in your deployment).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/search_in_topic.png)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Body message">
```json

"states": ["STARTED", "FINISHED", "ONHOLD"],
"applicationIds": ["8dd20844-2dc5-4445-83a5-bbbcc82bed5f"]
}
```
* **searchKey** - Represents the process key used to search data stored in a process.
<Warning>
Indexing this key within the process is crucial for the Data Search service to effectively locate it. To enable indexing, navigate to your desired Application then choose the process definition and access **Process Settings → Data Search**.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-19%20at%2018.37.53.png)
❗️ Keys are indexed automatically when the process status changes (e.g., created, started, finished, failed, terminated, expired), when swimlanes are altered, or when stages are modified. To ensure immediate indexing, select the 'Update in Task Management' option either in the **node configuration** or within **Process Settings → General** tab.
</Warning>
* **value** -  The dynamic process key added on our input element that will store and send the data entered by a user to the front end.

# Task management
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview
Task Management in FlowX.AI is a core functionality that allows users to create, configure, and manage tasks within the platform, providing a structured way to handle work processes. It enables the definition of tasks based on business processes, offers tools for allocating, tracking, and managing tasks across various roles and departments, and supports customization through views, filters, and rules.
<Frame>
![Task Manager](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/tsk_mng2.0.png)
</Frame>
Task Management also includes capabilities for user roles, customizable tables, and integration with the project through both low-code and full-code approaches, ensuring flexibility for various use cases.
## Key features
* **Views**: Configurable interfaces to display task-related data based on process definitions.
* **Hooks**:  Upon a token's entry/exit from the selected process, it initiates a specified process, swimlane, or stage based on the configured settings.
* **Stages**: used to monitor the progression of tasks within a process by identifying where it may have stalled. This functionality can be used for teams but also for various business stages: onboarding, verification, and validation processes.
* **Allocation Rules**: Facilitate the equal distribution of tasks among users with permissions in a specific swimlane.
## Task Management Views
Views offer a flexible way to tailor task data display according to business needs. By configuring views, users can create structured, customized interfaces that help specific roles, departments, or use cases access relevant data effectively.
Example of custom view:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2016.29.13.png)
</Frame>
### All tasks
In the All Tasks section, you can view all tasks generated from any process definition marked as "to be used in task manager" within a project. This provides a centralized view of all relevant tasks, as long as you have the appropriate permissions.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-11%20at%2018.32.13.png)
</Frame>
It provides an interactive visualization, with built-in filtering functionalities for refined data display.
<Info>
Dataset Config and Table Config options are not accessible in the All Tasks view.
</Info>
### Creating a view
In the Views section, you can create a new view by selecting a name and choosing a process definition. The process definition is crucial because it determines which keys you can access when configuring the view.
To set up a view, navigate to the Views section in the Task Management interface:
1. Click **Add View**.
2. Enter a **Name** for the view.
3. **Choose a Process Definition**: This will link the view's configuration to a specific process and its associated keys.
<Info>
Once a view is created for a process (e.g., Process X), it cannot be reassigned to another process. This ensures consistent data structuring based on the selected process definition.
</Info>
Upon creating a view, you are automatically redirected to configure its parameters.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/2024-11-11%2018.34.39.gif)
</Frame>
The Task Management default view contains four primary columns, with two additional default columns that can be added.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-11%20at%2018.37.30.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
You also have the option to add custom parameters to the table, with no limit on the number of columns.
</Tip>
**Columns explained**:
* **Stage**: Indicates where the process halted, providing a clear view of its current state.
* **Assignee**: Displays the individual to whom the task is assigned.
* **Priority**: Reflects the urgency level of the task.
* **Last Updated**: Shows the timestamp of the most recent action taken on the task.
* **Title**: Displays the designated name of the task, which can be customized by using Business Rules.
* **Status**: Represents the current state of a Token, such as 'Started' or 'Finished.'
* **Custom parameters**: User-defined keys within the process settings, which become available only after their configuration is complete.
### Customer parameters and display names
### Display names
You can rename default and custom parameters to make them contextually relevant for various business needs. For example:
* Rename an address field to clarify if it refers to "Residence" or "Issuing Location."
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/2024-11-11%2019.13.07.gif)
</Frame>
* Use Substitution Tags for dynamic display names.
<Info>
Renaming a parameter’s Display Name will only change how it’s shown in the interface, without altering the actual data model. The rename option is also available for default parameters (not just custom parameters). Changing the Display Name also allows the use of Substitution Tags.
</Info>
### Custom Parameters in Task Management
Custom parameters in Task Management provide a way to tailor task displays and ensure that task data aligns with specific business needs and contexts.
**Key setup and configuration**
1. **Adding Custom Parameters**:
* In **Process Settings** → **Task Management**, you can define the custom keys that will be indexed and made available for tasks.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-11%20at%2019.11.02.png)
</Frame>
* Each custom parameter can be renamed to suit different business contexts, ensuring clarity in cases where parameters may have multiple meanings.
<Check>
Ensure that the custom key exists in the **Data Model** before it can be mapped in Task Management.
<Warning>
If the **attribute type** of a custom key is modified after it has been indexed, the key must be re-indexed in the **Task Management** section. This re-indexing step is crucial to ensure that Task Management reflects the updated attribute type correctly.
</Warning>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2010.38.23.png)
</Frame>
</Check>
<Tip>
For data from custom parameters to flow correctly, ensure that **Forms to Validate** is set on the **UI Action button** in your UI for the corresponding process. This configuration is necessary for custom parameters to be validated and included in Task Management.
</Tip>
2. **Labeling Custom Parameters**:
* When adding a custom parameter, use the rename option to assign it a label relevant to the process context (as demonstrated in the example [**above**](#display-names)).
* This allows parameters to remain flexible for different roles or departments, adapting to each use case seamlessly.
3. **Enabling Task Management Integration**:
* To ensure that data flows correctly into Task Management, enable the **Use process in task management** toggle in **Process Settings** within your **project** in **FlowX Designer**.
* Some actions may be restricted based on user roles and access rights, so confirm that your role allows necessary access.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/tm_key.mp4" />
</Frame>
4. **Configuring Node-Specific Updates**:
* To enable Task Manager to send targeted updates from specific parts of a process:
* In **FlowX Designer**, open the relevant **project** and then the desired **process definition** and click **Edit**.
* Select the node(s) where updates should be triggered and enable the **Update task management?** switch.
* You can configure this action for multiple nodes, allowing flexibility in tracking and updating based on process flow.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2013.01.54.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
Activating the **Use process in task management** flag at both the process settings level and node level is essential for ensuring data consistency and visibility in Task Management.
</Warning>
### Table config and Dataset config in Task Management
You can use **Table Config** and **Dataset Config** to configure and filter task data effectively. These configurations help create a customized and user-friendly interface for different roles, departments, or organizational needs.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2013.41.17.png)
</Frame>
#### Table config
**Table Config** is used to define the structure and content of the Task Management table view. Here, you can configure the columns displayed in the table and set up default sorting options.
1. **Configuring the Table Columns**:
* **Default Columns**: By default, the table includes the following columns: **Stage**, **Assignee**, **Priority**, and **Last Updated**.
* You can add additional columns, such as **Title**, **Status**, and **Custom Parameters**. Custom parameters can be chosen from the keys configured in **Process Settings** → **Task Management**.
2. **Setting Default Sorting**:
* You can select one column for **default sorting** in ascending or descending order. This configuration helps prioritize how data is initially displayed, often based on “Last Updated” or other relevant fields.
* If no specific sorting rule is configured, the table will automatically apply sorting based on the **Last Updated** column.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2013.54.57.png)
</Frame>
#### Dataset config
**Dataset Config** is used to filter and refine the data displayed in Task Management views. This helps create targeted views based on specific needs, such as differentiating data for front office vs. back office or specific roles like managers and operators.
1. **Adding Filters**:
* You can apply filters on the keys brought into the **Dataset Config** to customize the data shown. Filters can be applied based on various data types, such as enums, strings, numbers, dates, and booleans.
2. **Filtering Options by Data Type**:
* **Enums**: Can be filtered using the `In` operator. Only parent enums are available for mapping in Task Management (ensure enums are mapped in the data model beforehand).
<Info>
Before you can map enums in Task Management, they must be configured in the Data Model. Only parent enums can be mapped.
<Warning>
If any changes are made to the Data Model after the keys have been configured and indexed in Task Management, these changes will not be automatically reflected. You must re-add and re-index the keys in the process settings to ensure that the updated information is indexed correctly.
</Warning>
</Info>
* **Strings**: Available filters include `Not equal`, `In`, `Starts with`, `Ends with`, `Contains`, and `Not contains`.
* **Numbers**: Filters include `Equals`, `Not equal`, `Greater than`, `Less than`, `Greater than or equal`, and `Less than or equal`.
* **Dates and Currencies**: Filters include `Equals`, `Not equal`, `Greater than`, `Less than`, `Greater than or equal`, `Less than or equal`, and `In range`.
* **Booleans**: Can be filtered using the `Equals` operator.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2017.07.35.png)
</Frame>
3. **Role-Specific Configurations**:
* **Dataset Config** allows creating views tailored to specific audiences, such as different departments or roles within an organization. However, note that filters in Dataset Config do not override user permissions on task visibility.
Example with filter applied a number attribute:
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/dataset_config.mp4" />
</Frame>
### Managing data model changes
While creating a view, you may want to modify the **data model**. It's important to note that changes to the **data model** do not directly impact the views. Views are tied to the process definition, not the data model. Therefore, if you make changes to the data model, you do not need to create a new view unless the changes also impact the underlying process.
### Task details
The **Task Details** tab within **Task Manager** provides key process information, including:
* **Priority**: Enables task prioritization.
* **Status**: The current process status (in our example, `STARTED`)
* **Stage**: Specific stages during process execution.
* **Comments**: User comments.
* **History**: Information such as task creation, creator, and status changes.
* **Last Updated**: Displays the most recent timestamp of any changes made to a task.
* **View Application**: Provides direct access to the container application URL where the FlowX.AI process related to a specific task is running.
<Frame>
![Task details](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-12%20at%2017.46.01.png)
</Frame>
**Accessing Task details in Task Management**
To access the **Task Details** of a specific task in a Task Management view, follow these steps:
1. **Navigate to the Task Management Interface**:
* Open the Task Management section within the project and select the desired **View** that contains the list of tasks.
2. **Locate the Task**:
* In the selected view (e.g., All Tasks, Custom View), find the task you want to inspect. Use filters and sorting options if necessary to locate the task more efficiently.
3. **Open Task Details**:
* Click on the task or select the **Details** option (often represented by an icon or “Details” link) associated with the task entry.
* This action will open the **Task Details** panel, which provides an in-depth view of information specific to that task.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/task_view.mp4" />
</Frame>
<Info>
Please note that specific roles must be defined in a process to utilize all the task management features. For configuration details, see [**Configuring Access Roles for Task Manager**](../../../../setup-guides/plugins-access-rights/configuring-access-rights-for-task-management).
</Info>
## Process status updates
Task Manager displays various statuses based on process state:
| Status         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Created**    | This status is visible only if there is an issue with the process creation. If the process is error-free in its configuration, you will see the **Started** status instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Started**    | Indicates that the process is in progress and running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Finished**   | The process has reached an end node and completed its execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Failed**     | Displayed when a [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) is enabled in the [FlowX Engine](../../../../core-components/flowx-engine). For example, if a CronJob is triggered but not completed on time, tasks move to the `FAILED` status.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Expired**    | <p>Displayed when <code>expiryTime</code> field is defined within the process definition. To set up an <code>expiryTime</code> function, follow these steps</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>FLOWX Designer > Processes > Definitions</strong>.</li><li>Select a process and click the "<strong>⋮</strong>" <strong /> button, then choose <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Inside the <strong>General</strong> tab, you can edit the <strong>Expiry time</strong> field.</li></ol> |
| **Aborted**    | This status is available for processes that also contain subprocesses. When a subprocess is running (and the [token is moved backward](../../../flowx-designer/managing-a-process-flow/moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process) to redo a series of previous actions) - the subprocess will be aborted.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Dismissed**  | Available for processes that contain subprocesses. It is displayed when a user stops a subprocess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **On hold**    | Freezes the process, blocking further actions. A superuser can trigger this status for clarification or unfreeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Terminated** | A request is sent via Kafka to terminate a process instance, ending all active tokens in the current process or subprocesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
## Swimlanes and Stages updates
Task Manager also tracks swimlane and stage changes:
### Swimlanes updates
| Status             | Definition                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Swimlane Enter** | Marks token entering a new swimlane. |
| **Swimlane Exit**  | Indicates token exiting a swimlane.  |
### Stages updates
| Status          | Definition                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Stage Enter** | Marks token entering a new stage. |
| **Stage Exit**  | Indicates token exiting a stage.  |
## Using the plugin
The Task Manager plugin offers a range of features tailored to different roles, including:
* [Swimlane permissions for Task Management](#swmlane-permissions-for-task-management)
* [Assigning and unassigning Tasks](#task-assignment-and-reassignment)
* [Hold/unhold tasks](#hold/unhold-tasks)
* [Adding comments](#adding-comments)
* [Viewing the application](#viewing-the-application)
* [Bulk updates (via Kafka)](#bulk-updates)
### Swimlane permissions for Task Management
To perform specific actions within Task Management at process level, you must configure swimlane permissions at the process settings level. Each swimlane (e.g., BackOffice, FrontOffice, Manager) should be assigned appropriate roles and permissions based on the responsibilities and access needs of each user group.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-14%20at%2012.44.21.png)
</Frame>
**Example permissions configuration**
Below are example configurations for swimlane permissions based on roles commonly used in a loan application approval process:
1. **BackOffice Swimlane**:
* Role: `FLOWX_BACKOFFICE`
* Permissions:
* **Unhold**: Allows the user to resume tasks that have been put on hold.
* **Execute**: Enables the user to perform task actions.
* **Self Assign**: Permits users to assign tasks to themselves.
* **View**: Grants viewing rights for tasks.
* **Hold**: Allows tasks to be temporarily paused.
2. **Manager (Supervisor) Swimlane**:
* Role: `FLOWX_MANAGER`
* Permissions:
* **Unhold**: Allows the user to resume tasks that have been put on hold.
* **Execute**: Enables the user to perform task actions.
* **Self Assign**: Permits users to assign tasks to themselves.
* **View**: Grants viewing rights for tasks.
* **Hold**: Allows tasks to be temporarily paused.
<Info>
These permissions can be customized depending on each use case and organizational needs. Ensure that permissions are aligned with the roles' responsibilities within the workflow.
</Info>
### Task assignment and reassignment
Consider this scenario: you're the HR manager overseeing the onboarding process for new employees. In order to streamline this operation, you've opted to leverage the task manager plugin. This process consists of two key phases: the Initiation Stage and the Account Setup Stage, each requiring a designated team member.
The Initiation Stage has successfully concluded, marking the transition to the Account Setup Stage. At this juncture, it's essential to reassign the task, originally assigned to John Doe, to Jane Doe, a valuable member of the backoffice team.

</Frame>
### Hold/unhold tasks
As a project manager overseeing various ongoing projects, you may need to temporarily pause one due to unforeseen circumstances. To manage this, you use the "On Hold" status.
<Frame>

</Tip>
#### Process data level
If task.baseUrl is specified in the process parameters, it will be sent to the Task Manager to update the tasks accordingly.
```java
output.put("task", {"baseUrl": "https://your_base_url"});
```

![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/tsk_manager_base_url.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
The `baseURL` set in the process data (business rules) will override the `baseURL` set in the process definition settings.
</Warning>
## Bulk updates
Send bulk update requests via Kafka (using Process Engine) to perform multiple operations at once. Use the Kafka topic:
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_BULK_IN` (request sent from the  Process Engine) to send bulk operations to `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_BULK_OUT` (Task Management) as an array, allowing multiple operations at once. More details [**here**](../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#topics-related-to-the-task-management-plugin).
Example of a bulk request:
```json
{
"operations": [
{
"operationType": "HOLD",
"taskId": "some task id",
"processInstanceUuid": "d3aabfd8-d041-4c62-892f-22d17923b223", // the id of the process instance
"swimlaneName": "Default", //name of the swimlane
"owner": null,
"author": "john.doe@flowx.ai",
"requestID": "1234567891"
},
{
"operationType": "HOLD",
"taskId": "some task id",
"processInstanceUuid": "d3aabfd8-d041-4c62-892f-22d17923b223",
"swimlaneName": "Default", //name of the swimlane
"owner": null,
"author": "jonh.doe@flowx.ai",
"requestID": "1234567890"
}
]
}
```

## Updating Task Manager metadata through Business Rules
You can dynamically update the task title during process execution using Business Rules. This allows you to customize how tasks are displayed in the Task Manager based on process data, ensuring that tasks are easily identifiable and relevant to their current context.
### Updating the task title
The task title can be updated using the following approach:
```javascript
// Define your task title
const taskTitle = "SME Branch Lending";
// Update the task title
output.put("task", {
"title": taskTitle
});
```
You can make task titles more dynamic and informative by incorporating process data:
```javascript
// Get relevant data from the process
const clientDataSection = input.clientDataSection;
// Create a descriptive task title
const taskTitle = `Loan Application #${applicationId} - ${clientDataSection.firstName} - ${clientDataSection.lastName}`;
// Update the task title
output.put("task", {
"title": taskTitle
});
```
## Full-Code implementation
For more customized UX, the **full-code** implementation using the **Task Management SDKs (React and Angular)** allows developers to build custom tables, cards, or any other UI elements based on the views and columns configured in Task Management.
## FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What happens to currencies, numbers, and dates already indexed when a locale or format override is applied in the UI Designer?">
A: The format changes will only affect how the data is displayed, not how it's indexed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I switch to full-code if I'm not satisfied with the current view and filter options?">
A: Yes, you can always switch to full-code and create custom views or tables using the Task Management SDK.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How are subprocess keys handled in Task Management?">
A: To use data from a subprocess, you must send it to the parent process first. Subprocess keys are currently displayed in the task manager once indexed through the parent process.

# Using allocation rules
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-allocation-rules
Allocation rules are meant to define when tasks should be auto-assigned to users when they reach a swimlane that has a specific role configured (for example, specific tasks will be assigned for the _front office_ and specific tasks for the _back office_ only).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-11-14%20at%2012.54.21.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
Tasks will always be allocated depending on the users load (number of tasks) from current/other processes. If there are two or more users with the same number of assigned tasks, the task will be randomly assigned to one of them.
</Info>
## Accessing allocation rules
To access the allocation rules, follow the next steps:
1. Open **FlowX Designer**.
2. Go to your **Application** and from the side menu, under **Task Management**, select the **Allocation rules** entry.
## Adding process and allocation rules

# Using hooks
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/task-management/using-hooks
Hooks allow you to extract stateful logic from a component, so it can be tested and reused independently.
Users with task management permissions can create hooks to trigger specific **process instances**, such as sending notifications when **events** occur. Follow the instructions below to set up roles for hooks scope usage:
<Card title="Manage hooks roles" href="../../../../setup-guides/plugins-access-rights/configuring-access-rights-for-task-management" icon="link" />
<Frame>
![Hooks](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/hooks.png)
</Frame>
Hooks can be linked to different events and define what will happen when they are triggered. Below you can find a list of all possible triggers for each hook.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Process">
<ul>
<li>unique result</li>
<li>only one rule will match, or no rule</li>
</ul>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Swimlane">
<ul>
<li>rule outputs are prioritized</li>
<li>rules may overlap, but only match with the highest output priority counts </li>
</ul>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Stage">
<ul>
<li> unique results </li>
<li>multiple rules can be satisfied </li>
<li>all satisfied rules must generate the same output, otherwise the rule is violated</li>
</ul>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/integrations/building-a-connector
Connectors are the vital gateway to enhancing FlowX.AI's capabilities. They seamlessly integrate external systems, introducing new functionalities by operating as independently deployable, self-contained microservices.
## Connector essentials
At its core, a connector acts as an anti-corruption layer. It manages interactions with external systems and crucial data transformations for integrations.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/connector_structure.png)
## Key Functions
Connectors act as lightweight business logic layers, performing essential tasks:
1. **Data Transformation**: Ensure compatibility between different data formats, like date formats, value lists, and units.
2. **Information Enrichment:** Add non-critical integration information like flags and tracing GUIDs.
## Creating a connector
1. **Create a Kafka Consumer:** Follow [**this guide**](./creating-a-kafka-consumer) to configure a Kafka consumer for your Connector.
2. **Create a Kafka Producer:** Refer to [**this guide**](./creating-a-kafka-producer) for instructions on setting up a Kafka producer.
<Info>
Adaptable Kafka settings can yield advantageous event-driven communication patterns. Fine-tuning partition counts and consumers based on load testing is crucial for optimal performance.
</Info>
### Design considerations
Efficient Connector design within an event-driven architecture demands:
* Load balancing solutions for varying communication types between the Connector and legacy systems.
* Custom implementations for request load balancing, Connector scaling, and more.
<Check>
Incorporate all received Kafka headers in responses to ensure seamless communication with the FlowX Engine.
</Check>
### Connector configuration sample
Here's a basic setup example for a connector:
* Configurations and examples for Kafka listeners and message senders.
* **OPTIONAL**: Activation examples for custom health checks.
[Sample available here](https://github.com/flowx-ai/quickstart-connector/tree/feature/easy-start)
Follow these steps and check the provided code snippets to effectively implement your custom FLOWX connector:
1. **Name Your Connector**: Choose a meaningful name for your connector service in the configuration file (`quickstart-connector/src/main/resources/config/application.yml`):
```yaml
spring:
application:
name: easy-connector-name # TODO 1. Choose a meaningful name for your connector service.
jackson:
serialization:
write_dates_as_timestamps: false
fail-on-empty-beans: false
```
2. **Select Listening Topic:** Decide the primary topic for your connector to listen on ( you can do this at the following path → `quickstart-connector/src/main/resources/config/application-kafka.yml`):
<Check>
If the connector needs to listen to multiple topics, ensure you add settings and configure a separate thread pool executor for each needed topic (refer to `KafkaConfiguration`, you can find it at `quickstart-connector/src/main/java/ai/flowx/quickstart/connector/config/KafkaConfiguration.java`).
</Check>
3. **Define Reply Topic**: Determine the reply topic, aligning with the Engine's topic pattern.
4. **Adjust Consumer Threads**: Modify consumer thread counts to match partition numbers.
```yaml
kafka:
consumer.threads: 3  # TODO 4. Adjust number of consumer threads. Make sure number of instances * number of threads = number of partitions per topic.
auth-exception-retry-interval: 10
topic:
in: ai.flowx.easy-connector.in # TODO 2. Decide what topic should the connector listen on.
out: ai.flowx.easy-connector.out # TODO 3. Decide what topic should the connector reply on (this topic name must match the topic pattern the Engine listens on).
```
5. **Define Incoming Data Format (DTO)**: Specify the structure for incoming and outgoing data using DTOs. This can be found at the path: `quickstart-connector/src/main/java/ai/flowx/quickstart/connector/dto/KafkaRequestMessageDTO.java`.
```java
//Example for incoming DTO Format
package ai.flowx.quickstart.connector.dto;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;
import lombok.ToString;
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
public class KafkaRequestMessageDTO { // TODO 5. Define incoming DTO format.
private String Id;
}
```
6. **Define Outgoing Data Format (DTO)**: Specify the structure for outgoing data at the following path → `quickstart-connector/src/main/java/ai/flowx/quickstart/connector/dto/KafkaResponseMessageDTO.java`.
```java
// Example for Outgoing DTO Format
package ai.flowx.quickstart.connector.dto;
import lombok.Builder;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;
import lombok.ToString;
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
@Builder
public class KafkaResponseMessageDTO implements BaseApiResponseDTO { // TODO 6. Define outgoing DTO format.
private String name;
private String errorMessage;
}
```
7. **Implement Business Logic**: Develop logic for handling messages from the Engine and generating replies. Ensure to include the process instance UUID as a Kafka message key.
Optional Configuration Steps:
* **Health Checks:** Enable health checks for all utilized services in your setup.
```yaml
management: # TODO optional: enable health check for all the services you use in case you add any
health:
kafka.enabled: false
```
Upon completion, your configuration files (`application.yaml` and `application-kafka.yaml`) should resemble the provided samples, adjusting settings according to your requirements:
```yaml
logging:
level:
ROOT: INFO
ai.flowx.quickstart.connector: INFO
io.netty: INFO
reactor.netty: INFO
jdk.event.security: INFO
server:
port: 8080
spring:
application:
name: easy-connector-name
jackson:
serialization:
write_dates_as_timestamps: false
fail-on-empty-beans: false
management:
health:
kafka.enabled: false
spring.config.import: application-kafka.yml
logging.level.ROOT: DEBUG
logging.level.ai.flowx.quickstart.connector: DEBUG
```
And your Kafka configuration file (`application-kafka.yaml`) should look like this:
```yaml
spring:
kafka:
bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
security.protocol: "PLAINTEXT"
producer:
key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

login.callback.handler.class: io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler
```
## Setting up the connector locally
For detailed setup instructions, refer to the Setting Up FLOWX.AI Quickstart Connector Readme:
<Card title="Readme file" href="https://github.com/flowx-ai/quickstart-connector/tree/feature/easy-start/doc" icon="files" />
Prerequisites:
* a terminal to clone the GitHub repository
* a code editor and IDE
* JDK version 17
* the Docker Desktop app
* an internet browser
## Integrating a connector in FLOWX.AI Designer
To integrate and utilize the connector within FLOWX.AI Designer, follow these steps:
1. **Process Designer Configuration**: Utilize the designated communication nodes within the [Process Designer](../../building-blocks/process/process):
* [**Send Message Task**](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task): Transmit a message to a topic monitored by the connector. Make sure you choose **Kafka Send Action** type.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/connector_topic.png)
</Frame>
* [**Receive Message Task**](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-receive-task): Await a message from the connector on a topic monitored by the engine.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/connector_topic_out.png)
</Frame>
2. **Connector Operations**: The connector identifies and processes the incoming message.
3. **Handling Response**: Upon receiving a response, the connector serializes and deposits the message onto the specified OUT topic.
4. **Engine Processing**: The engine detects the new message, captures the entire content, and stores it within its variables based on the configured variable settings.
You can check another example of a more complex connector by checking the following repository:

## Managing integration endpoints
### Systems
A system is a collection of resources—endpoints, authentication, and variables—used to define and run integration workflows.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/systems_overview.png)
</Frame>
### Creating a new system definition
With **Systems** feature you can create, update, and organize endpoints used in API integrations. These endpoints are integral to building workflows within the Integration Designer, offering flexibility and ease of use for managing connections between systems. Endpoints can be configured, tested, and reused across multiple workflows, streamlining the integration process.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/systems.png)
</Frame>
Go to the **Systems** section in FlowX Designer at **Projects** -> **Your project** -> **Integrations** -> **Systems**.
1. Add a **New System**, set the system’s unique code, name, and description:
* **Name**: The system's name.
* **Code**: A unique identifier for the external system.
* **Base URL**: The base URL is the main address of a website or web application, typically consisting of the protocol (`http` or `https`), domain name, and a path.
* **Description**: A description of the system and its purpose.
* **Enable enumeration value mapping**: If checked, this system will be listed under the mapped enumerations. See [enumerations](../core-extensions/content-management/enumerations) section for more details.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/create_new_system.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
To dynamically adjust the base URL based on the upper environment (e.g., dev, QA, stage), you can use environment variables and configuration parameters. For example: `https://api.${environment}.example.com/v1`.
Additionally, keep in mind that the priority for determining the configuration parameter (e.g., base URL) follows this order: first, input from the user/process; second, configuration parameters overrides (set directly on FlowX.AI designer or environment variables); and lastly, configuration parameters.
</Tip>
2. Set up authorization (Service Token, Bearer Token, or No Auth). In our example, we will set the auth type as a bearer and we will set it at system level:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/auth_bearer_token.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
The value of the token might change depending on the environment so it is recommended to define it at system level and apply [Configuration Parameters Overrides](../../projects/runtime/configuration-parameters-overrides) at runtime.
</Tip>
### Defining REST integration endpoints
In this section you can define REST API endpoints that can be reused across different workflows.
1. Under the **Endpoints** section, add the necessary endpoints for system integration.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/add_new_endpoint.png)
</Frame>
2. Configure an endpoint by filling in the following properties:
* **Method**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
* **Path**: Path for the endpoint.
* **Parameters**: Path, query, and header parameters.
* **Response Settings**: Expected response codes and formats.
* **Body**: JSON payload for requests.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/get_endpoint.png)
</Frame>
### Defining variables
The Variables tab allows you to store system-specific variables that can be referenced throughout workflows using the format `${variableName}`.
These declared variables can be utilized not only in workflows but also in other sections, such as the Endpoint or Authorization tabs.
<Tip>
For example:
* For our integration example, you can declare configuration parameters and use the variables to store your tableId and baseId and reference them the **Variables** tab.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/id_variables.png)
</Frame>
* Use variables in the **Base URL** to switch between different environments, such as UAT or production.
</Tip>
### Endpoint parameter types
When configuring endpoints, several parameter types help define how the endpoint interacts with external systems. These parameters ensure that requests are properly formatted and data is correctly passed.
#### Path parameters
Elements embedded directly within the URL path of an API request that acts as a placeholder for specific value.
* Used to specify variable parts of the endpoint URL (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
* Defined with `${parameter}` format.
* Mandatory in the request URL.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/path_parameters.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
Path parameters must always be included, while query and header parameters are optional but can be set as required based on the endpoint’s design.
</Tip>
#### Query parameters
Query parameters are added to the end of a URL to provide extra information to a web server when making requests.
* Query parameters are appended to the URL after a `?` symbol and are typically used for filtering or pagination (e.g., `?search=value`)
* Useful for filtering or pagination.
* Example URL with query parameters: [https://api.example.com/users?search=johndoe\&page=2](https://api.example.com/users?search=johndoe\&page=2).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/Screenshot%202024-10-17%20at%2018.18.12.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
These parameters must be defined in the Parameters table, not directly in the endpoint path.
</Warning>
<Info>
To preview how query parameters are sent in the request, you can use the **Preview** feature to see the exact request in cURL format. This shows the complete URL, including query parameters.
</Info>
#### Header parameters
Used to give information about the request and basically to give instructions to the API of how to handle the request
* Header parameters (HTTP headers) provide extra details about the request or its message body.
* They are not part of the URL. Default values can be set for testing and overridden in the workflow.
* Custom headers sent with the request (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer token`).
* Define metadata or authorization details.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/header_parameters1.png)
</Frame>
#### Body parameters
The data sent to the server when an API request is made.
* These are the data fields included in the body of a request, usually in JSON format.
* Body parameters are used in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests to send data to the external system (e.g., creating or updating a resource).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/body_param.png)
</Frame>
#### Response body parameters
The data sent back from the server after an API request is made.
* These parameters are part of the response returned by the external system after a request is processed. They contain the data that the system sends back.
* Typically returned in GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH requests. Response body parameters provide details about the result of the request (e.g., confirmation of resource creation, or data retrieval)
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/response_body_param.png)
</Frame>
### Enum mapper
The enum mapper for the request body enables you to configure enumerations for specific keys in the request body, aligning them with values from the External System or translations into another language.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/enum_mapper.png)
</Frame>
On enumerations you can map both translation values from different languages or values for different source systems.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/Screenshot%202024-10-27%20at%2012.42.28.png)
</Frame>
Make sure you have the enumerations created with corresponding translations and system values values in your application already:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/2024-10-27%2012.41.08.gif)
</Frame>
<Info>
Select whether to use in the integration the enumeration value corresponding to the External System or the translation into another language.
For translating into language a header parameter called 'Language' is required to specify the language for translation.
</Info>
### Configuring authorization
* Select the required **Authorization Type** from a predefined list.
* Enter the relevant details based on the selected type (e.g., Realm and Client ID for Service Accounts).
* These details will be automatically included in the request headers when the integration is executed.
### Authorization methods
The Integration Designer supports several authorization methods, allowing you to configure the security settings for API calls. Depending on the external system's requirements, you can choose one of the following authorization formats:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/auth_type.png)
</Frame>
#### Service account
Service Account authentication requires the following key fields:
* **Identity Provider Url**: The URL for the identity provider responsible for authenticating the service account.
* **Client Id**: The unique identifier for the client within the realm.
* **Client secret**: A secure secret used to authenticate the client alongside the Client ID.
* **Scope**: Specifies the access level or permissions for the service account.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/auth_service_account.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
When using Entra as an authentication solution, the **Scope** parameter is mandatory. Ensure it is defined correctly in the authorization settings.
</Info>
#### Basic authentication
* Requires the following credentials:
* **Username**: The account's username.
* **Password**: The account's password.
* Suitable for systems that rely on simple username/password combinations for access.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/basic_auth.png)
</Frame>
#### Bearer
* Requires an **Access Token** to be included in the request headers.
* Commonly used for OAuth 2.0 implementations.
* Header Configuration: Use the format `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` in headers of requests needing authentication.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/token_bearer.png)
</Frame>
* System-Level Example: You can store the Bearer token at the system level, as shown in the example below, ensuring it's applied automatically to future API calls:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/bearer.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
Store tokens in a configuration parameter so updates propagate across all requests seamlessly when tokens are refreshed or changed.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/token_config_param.png)
</Tip>
#### Certificates
You might want to access another external system that require a certificate to do that. Use this setup to configure the secure communication with the system.
It includes paths to both a Keystore (which holds the client certificate) and a Truststore (which holds trusted certificates). You can toggle these features based on the security requirements of the integration.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/certificates_expand.gif)
</Frame>
When the Use Certificate option is enabled, you will need to provide the following certificate-related details:
* **Keystore Path**: Specifies the file path to the keystore, in this case, `/opt/certificates/testkeystore.jks`. The keystore contains the client certificate used for securing the connection.
* **Keystore Password**: The password used to unlock the keystore.
* **Keystore Type**: The format of the keystore, JKS or PKCS12, depending on the system requirements.
**Truststore credentials**
* **Truststore Path**: The file path is set to `/opt/certificates/testtruststore.jks`, specifying the location of the truststore that holds trusted certificates.
* **Truststore Password**: Password to access the truststore.
<Frame>

***
## Workflows
A workflow defines a series of tasks and processes to automate system integrations. Within the Integration Designer, workflows can be configured using different components to ensure efficient data exchange and process orchestration.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/workflow_ex.png)
</Frame>
### Creating a workflow
1. Navigate to Workflow Designer:
* In FlowX.AI Designer to **Projects -> Your application -> Integrations -> Workflows**.
* Create a New Workflow, provide a name and description, and save it.
2. Start to design your workflow by adding nodes to represent the steps of your workflow:
* **Start Node**: Defines where the workflow begins and also defines the input parameter for subsequent nodes.
* **REST endpoint nodes**: Add REST API calls for fetching or sending data.
* **Fork nodes (conditions)**: Add conditional logic for decision-making.
* **Data mapping nodes (scripts)**: Write custom scripts in JavaScript or Python.
* **End Nodes**: Capture output data as the completed workflow result, ensuring the process concludes with all required information.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/create_workflow.gif)
</Frame>
### Workflow nodes
Users can visually build workflows by adding various nodes, including:
* Workflow start node
* REST endpoint nodes
* Data mapping nodes (scripts)
* Fork nodes (conditions)
* End node
#### Worflow start node
The Start node is the default and mandatory first node in any workflow. It initializes the workflow and defines the input parameters defined on it for subsequent nodes.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/workflow_start_node.png)
</Frame>
The Start node defines the initial data model for the workflow. This input data model can be customized. You can enter custom JSON data by clicking inside the code editor and typing their input. This input data will be passed to subsequent nodes in the workflow.
<Tip>
For example, if you want to define a **first name** parameter, you can add it like this in the **Start Node**:
```json
{
"firstName": "John"
}
```
Later, in the body of a subsequent workflow node, you can reference this input using:
```json
{
"First Name": "${firstName}"
}
```
This ensures that the data from the Start node is dynamically passed through the workflow.
</Tip>
When you try to send input data from a process to a workflow, you can use the Start workflow node to map the data coming from a process and to send it acrross the entire workflow.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/start_input.png)
</Frame>
<Check>
Make sure the data is also mapped in the **Start Integration Workflow** node action where you have the data.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/data_input_start.png)
</Check>
<Info>
Only one Start node is allowed per workflow. The Start node is always the first node in the workflow and cannot have any incoming connections. Its sole function is to provide the initial data for the workflow.
</Info>
<Info>
The Start node cannot be altered in name, nor can it be deleted from the workflow.
</Info>
#### REST endpoint nodes
The REST endpoint node enables communication with external systems to retrieve or update data by making REST API calls. It supports multiple methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Endpoints are selected via a dropdown menu, where available endpoints are grouped by the system they belong to.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/add_rest_endpoint.gif)
</Frame>
The node is added by selecting it from the "Add Connection" dropdown in the workflow designer.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/rest_endpoint_add.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
You can include multiple REST endpoint nodes within the same workflow, allowing for integration with various systems or endpoints.
</Info>
<Tip>
Unlike some nodes, the Endpoint Call node can be run independently, making it possible to test the connection or retrieve data without executing the entire workflow.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/run_endpoint_node.gif)
</Tip>
**Input and output**
Each REST endpoint node includes some essential tabs:
* **Params**:
* **Response key**: The response from the endpoint node, including both data and metadata, is organized under a predefined response key.
* **Input**:
* This tab contains read-only JSON data that is automatically populated with the output from the previous node in the workflow.
* **Output**:
* It displays the API response in JSON format.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/input_output.mp4" />
</Frame>
#### Condition (fork) nodes
The Condition node evaluates incoming data from a connected node based on defined logical conditions(if/else if with). It directs the workflow along different paths depending on whether the condition evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.
<Info>
**Defining Conditions in JavaScript or Python**
Logical conditions for the Condition Node can be written in either JavaScript or Python, depending on the requirements of your workflow.
</Info>
* If the condition evaluates to TRUE, the workflow follows the If path.
* If the condition evaluates to FALSE, it follows the Else if path.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/fork_condition_node.png)
</Frame>
You can include multiple Condition nodes within a single workflow, enabling the creation of complex branching logic and decision-making flows.
**Parallel processing and forking**
The Condition node can split the workflow into parallel branches, allowing for multiple conditions to be evaluated simultaneously. This capability makes it ideal for efficiently processing different outcomes at the same time.
#### Data mapping nodes (scripts)
The Script node allows you to transform and map data between different systems during workflow execution by writing and executing custom code in JavaScript or Python. It enables complex data transformations and logic to be applied directly within the workflow.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/script_node.png)
</Frame>
#### End node
The End node signifies the termination of a workflow's execution. It collects the final output and completes the workflow process.
<Info>
Multiple End nodes can be included within a single workflow. This allows the workflow to have multiple possible end points based on different execution paths.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/end_1.png)
</Info>
The End node automatically receives input in JSON format from the previous node, and you can modify this input by editing it directly in the code editor. If the node's output doesn't meet mandatory requirements, it will be flagged as an error to ensure all necessary data is included.
The output of the End node represents the final data model of the workflow once execution is complete.
#### Testing the workflow
<Tip>
You can always test your endpoints in the context of the workflow. Run the endpoints separately (where is the case or run the entire workflow).
</Tip>
#### Debugging
Use the integrated console after running each workflow (either if you test your workflow in the workflow designer or in a process definition). It provides useful info like logs, input and output data about eacg endpoint and other details like execution time etc.
<Frame>
<video autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/console.mp4" />
</Frame>
### Workflow integration
Integrating workflows into a BPMN process allows for structured handling of tasks like user interactions, data processing, and external system integrations.
This is achieved by connecting workflow nodes to User Tasks and Service Tasks using the [**Start Integration Workflow**](../../building-blocks/actions/start-integration-workflow) action.
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a BPMN Process">
1. **Open the FlowX Process Designer**:
* Navigate to **Projects -> Your application -> Processes**.
* Create a new process or edit an existing one.
2. **Define the Data Model**:
<Info>
Needed if you want to send data from your user task to the workflow.
</Info>
* Establish the data model that will be shared between the process and the workflow.
* Ensure all necessary data fields that the workflow will use are included.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/data_model_int.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Configure a User Task or Service Task">
1. **Add a Task**:
* Insert a **User Task** or **Service Task** into your BPMN diagram.
* A **User Task** requires user input, while a **Service Task** can trigger automated actions without manual intervention.
2. **Configure Actions for the Task**:
* In the node config, add a **Start Integration Workflow** action.
* Select the target workflow you want to integrate. This links the task with the predefined workflow in the Integration Designer.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/add_action.png)
</Frame>
3. **Map the Payload**:
* If input data is defined in the **Start Node** of the workflow, it will be **automatically mapped** in the **Start Integration Workflow** action. Ensure that the workflow’s Start Node contains the fields you need.
* Additional payload keys and values can also be set up as needed to facilitate data flow from the process to the workflow.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/add_start_integration_workflow.gif)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Receive Data from the Workflow">
1. **Add a Receive Message Task**:
* To handle data returned by the workflow, add a **Receive Message Task** in the BPMN diagram.
* This task captures the workflow’s output data, such as processing status or results sent via Kafka.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/receive_kafka_workflow.png)
</Frame>
2. **Set Up a Data Stream Topic**:
* In the **Receive Message Task**, select your workflow from the **Data Stream Topics** dropdown.
* Ensure that the workflow output data, including status or returned values, is accurately captured under a predefined key.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with external systems
This example demonstrates how to integrate FlowX with an external system, in this example, using Airtable, to manage and update user credit status data. It walks through the setup of an integration system, defining API endpoints, creating workflows, and linking them to BPMN processes in FlowX Designer.
<Check>
Before going through this example of integration, we recommend:
* Create your own base and table in Airtable, details [here](https://www.airtable.com/guides/build/create-a-base).
* Check Airtable Web API docs [here](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) to get familiarized with Airtable API.
</Check>
### Integration in FlowX
<Steps>
<Step title="Define a System">
Navigate to the **Integration Designer** and create a new system:
* Name: **Airtable Credit Data**
* **Base URL**: `https://api.airtable.com/v0/`
<Frame>

<Step title="Define Endpoints">
In the **Endpoints** section, add the necessary API endpoints for system integration:
1. **Get Records Endpoint**:
* **Method**: GET
* **Path**: `/${baseId}/${tableId}`
* **Path Parameters**: Add the values for the baseId and for the tableId so they will be available in the path.
* **Header Parameters**: Authorization Bearer token
See the [API docs](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/list-records).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/integration_designer/airtable2.png)
</Frame>
2. **Create Records Endpoint**:
* **Method**: POST
* **Path**: `/${baseId}/${tableId}`
* **Path Parameters**: Add the values for the baseId and for the tableId so they will be available in the path.
* **Header Parameters**:
* `Content-Type: application/json`
* Authorization Bearer token
* **Body**: JSON format containing the fields for the new record. Example:
```json
{
"typecast": true,
"records": [
{
"fields": {
"First Name": "${firstName}",
"Last Name": "${lastName}",
"Age": ${age},
"Gender": "${gender}",
"Email": "${email}",
"Phone": "${phone}",
"Address": "${address}",

"phone": "${phone}",
"address": "${address}",
"occupation": "${occupation}",
"income": ${income},
"creditScore": ${creditScore},
"creditStatus": "${creditStatus}"
}
```
Make sure this keys are also mapped in the data model of your process with their corresponding attributes.
</Check>
* **REST Node**: Set up API calls:
* **GET Endpoint** for fetching records from Airtable.
* **POST Endpoint** for creating new records.
* **Condition Node**: Add logic to handle credit scores (e.g., triggering a warning if the credit score is below 300).
<Tip>
Condition example:
```json
input.responseKey.data.records[0].fields["Credit Score"] < 300
```
</Tip>
* **Script Node**: Include custom scripts if needed for processing data (not used in this example).
* **End Node**: Define the end of the workflow with success or failure outcomes.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/integrations/integrations-overview
Integrations play a crucial role in connecting legacy systems or third-party applications to the FlowX Engine. They enable seamless communication by leveraging custom code and the Kafka messaging system.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/custom_intg.svg)
Integrations serve various purposes, including working with legacy APIs, implementing custom file exchange solutions, or integrating with RPAs.
#### High-level architecture
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/intgr_final.png)
Integrations involve interaction with legacy systems and require custom development to integrate them into your FLOWX.AI setup.
## Developing a custom integration
Developing custom integrations for the FlowX.AI platform is a straightforward process. You can use your preferred technology to write the necessary custom code, with the requirement that it can send and receive messages from the **Kafka** cluster.
#### Steps to create a custom integration
Follow these steps to create a custom integration:
1. Develop a microservice, referred to as a "Connector," using your preferred tech stack. The Connector should listen for Kafka events, process the received data, interact with legacy systems if required, and send the data back to Kafka.
2. Configure the [process definition](../../building-blocks/process/process-definition) by adding a [message](../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) send action in one of the [nodes](../../building-blocks/node/node). This action sends the required data to the Connector.
3. Once the custom integration's response is ready, send it back to the FLOWX.AI engine. Keep in mind that the process will wait in a receive message node until the response is received.
For Java-based Connector microservices, you can use the following startup code as a quickstart guide:
<Card title="Quickstart connector" href="https://github.com/flowx-ai/quickstart-connector" icon="link" />
## Managing an integration
#### Managing Kafka topics
It's essential to configure the engine to consume events from topics that follow a predefined naming pattern. The naming pattern is defined using a topic prefix and suffix, such as "*ai.flowx.dev.engine.receive*."
<Tip>
We recommend the following naming convention for your topics:
```yaml
topic:
naming:
package: "ai.flowx."
environment: "dev."
version: ".v1"
prefix: ${kafka.topic.naming.package}${kafka.topic.naming.environment}
suffix: ${kafka.topic.naming.version}
engineReceivePattern: engine.receive
pattern: ${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}${kafka.topic.naming.engineReceivePattern}*
```
</Tip>
# Mock integrations
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/integrations/mock-integrations
If you need to test the business process flow but haven't completed all integrations, you can still do so by utilizing the mock integrations server included in the platform.
## Setup
To begin, configure the microservice's DB settings to use a Postgres DB. Then, deploy the mocked adapter microservice.
## Adding a new integration
Setting up a mocked integration requires only one step: adding a mock Kafka request and response.
You have two options for accomplishing this:
1. Add the information directly to the DB.
2. Use the provided [**API**](/4.0/docs/api/add-kafka-mock).
For each Kafka message exchange between the engine and the integration, you need to create a separate entry.
<Check>
Check out the [**Add new exchange Kafka mock**](/4.0/docs/api/add-kafka-mock) API reference for more details.
</Check>

# Observability with OpenTelemetry
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/integrations/open-telemetry
## What is Observability?
Observability is the capacity to infer the internal state of a system by analyzing its external outputs. In software development, this entails understanding the internal workings of a system through its telemetry data, which comprises traces, metrics, and logs.
## What is Open Telemetry?
OpenTelemetry is an observability framework and toolkit for generating and managing telemetry data, including traces, metrics, and logs. It is vendor-agnostic and compatible with various observability backends like Jaeger and Prometheus. Unlike observability backends, OpenTelemetry focuses on the creation, collection, and export of telemetry data, leaving storage and visualization to other tools.
<Info>
Tracing with Open Telemetry is availabile starting with FlowX.AI v.4.1.0 release.
</Info>
## How it works?
Our monitoring and performance analysis system leverages OpenTelemetry for comprehensive tracing and logging across our microservices architecture. By integrating with Grafana and other observability tools, we achieve detailed visibility into the lifecycle of requests, the performance of individual operations, and the interactions between different components of the system.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/otel_hla.drawio.png)
<Info>
OTEL Collectors are designed in a vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data. More information about OTEL Collectors, you can find [**here**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
</Info>
<Tip>
Recommended OpenTelemetry Collector Processors: Follow the [**recommended processors**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor#recommended-processors).
</Tip>
## Prerequisites
### Microservices
* Custom code addition for manual instrumentation.
* Configuration and deployment of Java agent.
* Performance impact assessment.
### Kubernetes
* Use of a Kubernetes Operator for managing instrumentation and tracing configuration.
## Instrumentation
### Auto-instrumentation with Java agent
* **Works**: Automatically wraps methods at the application edges (HTTP calls, Kafka messages, DB calls), creating spans and adding default span attributes.
* **Configuration**: Configure the Java agent for auto-instrumentation.
### Manual instrumentation
* **Custom Spans**: These were created for methods important to the business flow and enriched with business attributes such as `fx.type`, `fx.methodName`, `fx.processInstanceUuid`, and others.
* **Custom BUSINESS Spans**: Create spans for business events.
## Business logic metadata in logs and spans
Spans now include custom FlowX attributes (e.g., node names, action names, process names, instance UUIDs), which ccan be used for filtering and searching in traces.
Here is the full list of included custom FlowX span attributes:
### Custom span attributes
* fx.type - BUSINESS/TECHNICAL
* fx.methodName
* fx.parentProcessInstanceId
* fx.parentProcessInstanceUuid
* fx.processInstanceUuid
* fx.processName
* fx.processVersionId
* fx.tokenInstanceUuid
* fx.nodeName
* fx.nodeId
* fx.nodeUuid
* fx.boundaryEventId
* fx.nextNodeId
* fx.triggeredByBoundaryEventId
* fx.actionUuid
* fx.actionName
* fx.context
* fx.platform
### Custom business spans
* identified by the `fx.type = BUSINESS` attribute
### Detailed trace operations
Trace specific operations and measure request time across different layers/services.
* **Process Start**: Auto-instrumentation enabled for Spring Data to show time spent in repository methods. JDBC query instrumentation can be added.
* **Token Creation and Advancing**: Custom tracing added.
* **Action Execution and Subprocess Start**: Custom tracing added.
## Troubleshooting scenarios and common usages
### Scenario examples
* **Process Trace**: Analyze DB vs cache times, token advancement, node actions.
* **Parallel Gateway**: Trace split tokens.
* **DB Query Time**: Enable JDBC query tracing.
* **Endpoint Data Issues**: Check traces for Redis or DB source.
* **Token Stuck**: Filter by node name and process UUID.
* **Action Execution**: Trace action names for stuck tokens.
* **Subprocess Failures**: Analyze subprocess start and failures.
* **Latency Analysis**: Identify latencies in automatic actions.
* **Boundary Events**: Ensure Kafka schedule messages are sent and received correctly.
* **External Service Tracking**: Trace between process engine and external plugins.
### Business operation analysis
* **Long Running Operations**: Use Uptrace for identifying slow operations.
* **Failed Requests**: Filter traces by error status.
### Visualization of Traces
<Tip>
We recommend to use Grafana, but any observability platform compatible with OpenTelemetry standards can be used.
</Tip>
Grafana integrates with tracing backends such as Tempo (for tracing) and Loki (for logging), allowing us to visualize the entire lifecycle of a request. This includes detailed views of spans, which are the basic units of work in a trace. By using Grafana, we can:
* **View Trace Trees**: Grafana provides an intuitive UI for viewing the hierarchy and relationships between spans, making it easier to understand the flow of a request through the system.
* **Filter and Search**: Use Grafana to filter and search spans based on custom attributes like `fx.processInstanceUuid`, `fx.nodeName`, `fx.actionName`, and others. This helps in pinpointing specific operations or issues within a trace.
* **Error Analysis**: Identify spans with errors and visualize the stack trace or error message, aiding in quick troubleshooting.

# FlowX custom plugins
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins
Adding new capabilities to the core platform can be easily done by using plugins. FlowX plugins represent already-built functionality that can be added to a FlowX.AI platform deployment.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/plugins_40.png)
These could be either one of the provided custom **plugins** that we've already built or building your desired plugin.
On our roadmap, we’re also looking to enhance the **plugins library** with 3rd party providers, so stay tuned for more.
## High-level architecture
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/plugins_diagram.png)
The plugins are microservice apps that can be developed using any tech stack. The only requirement is that they need to be able to connect to the core platform using Kafka events.

<Card title="Receive message task (Kafka)" href="../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#receive-message-task" icon="file" />
To interact with plugins, you need to understand a few details about them:
* the events that can trigger them
* the infrastructure components needed
* the needed configurations
## Custom plugins
The currently available plugins are:
* [**Documents**](./custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview) - easily generate, host and access any kind of documents
* [**Notifications**](./custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/notifications-plugin-overview) - enhance your project with the option of sending custom emails or SMS notifications
* [**OCR**](./custom-plugins/ocr-plugin) - helps you scan your documents and integrate them into a business process
* [**Task management**](../core-extensions/task-management/task-management-overview) - a plugin suitable for back-officers and supervisors as it can be used to easily track and assign activities/tasks inside a company.
* [**Reporting**](./custom-plugins/reporting/reporting-overview) - a plugin that will help you create and bootstrap custom reports built on generic information about usage and processes metrics

# Converting files
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/converting-documents-to-different-formats
<Info>
Currently, the supported conversion method is limited to transforming **PDF** files into **JPEG** format.
</Info>
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to convert an uploaded file (utilizing the provided example) from PDF to JPEG.
## Prerequisites
1. **Access Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the Documents Plugin. The user account used for these operations should have the required access rights.
2. **Kafka Configuration**: Verify that the Kafka messaging system is properly configured and accessible. The Documents Plugin relies on Kafka for communication between nodes.
* **Kafka Topics**: Familiarize yourself with the Kafka topics used for these operations (later in this section)
3. Before initiating the conversion process, it is essential to identify the file in the storage solution using its unique ID. This ensures that the conversion is performed on an already uploaded file.
You have two options to obtain the file ID:
* Extract the file ID from a [**Response Message**](./uploading-a-new-document) of an upload file request. For more details, refer to the [**upload process documentation**](./uploading-a-new-document).
* Extract the file ID from a [**Response Message**](./generating-from-html-templates) of a generate from template request. For more details, refer to the [**document generation reply documentation**](./generating-from-html-templates)
<Info>
In the following example, we will use the `fileId` generated for [**Uploading a New Document**](./uploading-a-new-document) scenario.
```json
{
"customId": "119246",
"fileId": "96975e03-7fba-4a03-99b0-3b30c449dfe7",
"documentType": "BULK",
"documentLabel": null,
"minioPath": "flowx-dev-process-id-119246/119246/458_BULK.pdf",
"downloadPath": "internal/files/96975e03-7fba-4a03-99b0-3b30c449dfe7/download",
"noOfPages": null,
"error": null
}
```
</Info>
## Configuring the process
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/convert_pdf_to_jpeg.png)
To create a process that converts a document from PDF to JPEG format, follow these steps:
1. Create a process that includes a [**Send Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) node and a [**Receive Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node):
* Use the **Send Message Task** node to send the conversion request.
* Use the **Receive Message Task** node to receive the reply.
2. Configure the first node (**Send Message Task**) by adding a **Kafka send action**.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/convert_action_name.png)
3. Specify the [**Kafka topic**](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#kafka-configuration) where you send the conversion request.
<Tip>
To identify your defined topics in your current environment, follow the next steps:
1. From the FLOWX.AI main screen, navigate to the **Platform Status** menu at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. In the FLOWX Components list, scroll to the **document-plugin-mngt** line and press the eye icon on the right side.

# Documents plugin
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview
The Documents plugin can be easily added to your custom FlowX.AI deployment to enhance the core platform capabilities with functionality specific to document handling.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/doc_plugin_general.png)
</Frame>
The plugin offers the following features:
* **Document storage and editing**: Easily store and make changes to documents.
* **Document generation**: Generate documents using predefined templates and custom process-related data.
* **WYSIWYG editor**: Create various templates using a user-friendly ["What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor](../../wysiwyg).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/doc_plugin_wysiwyg.png)
</Frame>
* **Template import**: Import templates created in other environments.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/doc_plugin_create_import.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
When exporting a document template, it is transformed into a JSON file that can be imported later.
</Warning>
* **Document conversion**: Convert documents from PDF to JPEG format.
* **Document splitting**: Split bulk documents into smaller separate documents.
* **Document editing**: Add generated barcodes, signatures, and assets to documents.
* **OCR integration**: When a document requires OCR (Optical Character Recognitionq) processing, the Documents Plugin initiates the interaction by passing the document data or reference to the [**OCR plugin**](../ocr-plugin).
The Documents Plugin can be easily deployed on your chosen infrastructure, preloaded with industry-specific document templates using an intuitive WYSIWYG editor, and connected to the FLOWX Engine through Kafka events.
* [**Send Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task)
* [**Receive Message Task(Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-receive-task)
<Info>
Performance considerations:
To ensure optimal performance while using Documents Plugin, consider the following recommendations:
* For large or complex documents, it is recommended to allocate sufficient system resources, such as CPU and memory, to handle the conversion/editing process efficiently.
* Avoid processing extremely large files or a large number of files simultaneously, as it may impact performance and responsiveness.
* Monitor system resources during the generating/editing/converting etc. process and scale resources as needed to maintain smooth operations.
* Following these performance considerations will help optimize the document processing and improve overall system performance.
</Info>
## Using Documents plugin
Once you have deployed the Documents Plugin in your infrastructure, you can start creating various document templates. After selecting a document template, proceed to create a process definition by including [**Send Message/Receive Message**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) (Kafka nodes) and custom document-related actions in your process flow.
Before adding these actions to your **process definition**, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that all custom information is properly configured in the plugin database, such as the document templates to be used.
2. For each event type, you will need a corresponding Kafka topic.
<Check>
The `..in` topic names configured for the plugin should match [**the `..out` topic  names used when configuring the engine**](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka). Make sure to use an outgoing topic name that matches the pattern configured in the Engine. The value can be found and overwritten in the `KAFKA_TOPIC_PATTERN` variable.
For more details about Process Engine Kafka topic configuration, click [**here**](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka).
To make a request to the plugin, the process definition needs to include an action of type **Kafka send** defined on a [**Send Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task) node. The action parameter should have the key `topicName` and the corresponding topic name as its value.
To receive a reply from the plugin, the process definition needs to include a [**Receive Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-receive-task) node with a node value having the key `topicName` and the topic name as its value.
</Check>
Once the setup is complete, you can begin adding custom actions to your processes.
Let's explore a few examples that cover both the configuration and integration with the engine for all the use cases supported by the plugin:

# Generating documents
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates
One of the key features of the Documents plugin is the ability to generate new documents using custom templates, which can be pre-filled with data relevant to the current process instance.
<Info>
These templates can be easily configured using the [**What you see is what you get** (WYSIWYG)](../../wysiwyg). You can create and manage your templates by accessing the **Document Templates** section in [**FlowX Designer**](../../../../flowx-designer/overview).
</Info>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/docs_plugin_template.png)
## Generating documents from HTML templates
The Documents plugin simplifies the document generation process through predefined templates. This example focuses on generating documents using HTML templates.
## Prerequisites
1. **Access permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to manage documents templates (more details, [**here**](../../../../../setup-guides/plugins-access-rights/configuring-access-rights-for-documents)). The user account used for these operations should have the required access rights.
2. **Kafka configuration**: Verify that the Kafka messaging system is properly configured and accessible. The documents plugin relies on Kafka for communication between nodes.
* **Kafka topics**: Familiarize yourself with the Kafka topics used for these operations (later in this section)
## Creating an HTML template
To begin the document generation process, HTML templates must be created or imported. Utilize the [**WYSIWYG**](/4.1.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/wysiwyg) editor accessible through **FLOWX Designer → Plugins → Document templates**.
Learn more about managing HTML templates:
<Card title="Managing HTML templates" href="./managing-html-templates" icon="files" />
<Check>
Before using templates, ensure they are in a **Published** state. Document templates marked as **Draft/In Progress** will not undergo the generation process.
</Check>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/ocr_doc_template.gif)
</Frame>
<Tip>
We've created a comprehensive FlowX.AI Academy course guiding you through the process of **Creating a Document Template in Designer**. Access the course [**here**](https://academy.flowx.ai/catalog/info/id:172) for detailed instructions and insights.
</Tip>
## Sending a document generation request
Consider a scenario where you need to send a personalized document to a customer based on specific details they provide. Create a process involving a [**User task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/user-task-node), a [**Send Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-send-task), and a [**Receive Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#message-receive-task).
<Info>
In the initial user task node, users input information.
The second node (Kafka send) creates a request with a specified template and keys corresponding to user-filled values.
The third node sends the reply with the generated document under the specified key.
</Info>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/doc_plugin_upload_prev_ex.png)
</Frame>
1. Add a **User task** and configure it with UI elements for user input.
<Info>
In this example, three UI elements, comprising two input fields and a select (dropdown), will be used. Subsequently, leverage the keys associated with these UI elements to establish a binding with the template. This binding enables dynamic adjustments to the template based on user-input values, enhancing flexibility and customization.
</Info>
<video autoPlay muted loop className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/generate_template1.mp4" />
2. Configure the second node (Send Message Task) by adding a **Kafka send action**.
3. Specify the [**Kafka topic**](../../../../../setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/documents-plugin-setup#kafka-configuration) to which the request should be sent, enabling the Process Engine to process it; in our example it is `ai.flowx.in.document.html.in`.
<Tip>
To identify your defined topics in your current environment, follow the next steps:
1. From the **FlowX Designer** main screen, navigate to the **Platform Status** menu at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. In the FlowX Components list, scroll to the **document-plugin-mngt** line and press the eye icon on the right side.
3. In the details screen, expand the `KafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator` line and then **details → configuration → topic → document → generate**. Under HTML and PDF you will find the in and out topics for generating HTML or PDF documents.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/kafka_topics_html_generate.png)
</Tip>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/generate_html.gif)
</Frame>
4. Fill in the message with the expected values in the request body:
```json
{
"documentList": [
{
"customId": "ClientsFolder",
"templateName": "AccountCreation",
"language": "en",
"data": {
"firstInput": "${application.client.firstName}",
"secondInput": "${application.client.lastName}",
"thirdInput": "${application.client.accountType}"
},
"includeBarcode": false //if you want to include a barcode, you can set it to true
}
]
}
```
* **documentList**: A list of documents to be generated with properties (name and value to be replaced in the document templates)
* **customId**: Client ID
* **templateName**: The name of the template that you want to use (defined in the **Document templates** section)
* **language**: Should match the language set on the template (a template can be created for multiple languages as long as they are defined in the system, see [**Languages**](/4.1.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/languages) section for more information)
<Info>
When incorporating templates into the execution of a process, the extracted default values will be in accordance with the specifications of the default language configured in the system. For instance, if the default language is set to English, the template's default values will reflect those assigned to the English version. Make sure to match the language of your template with the default language of the system.
<Tip>
To verify the default language of the platform, navigate to **FlowX Designer → Content Management → Languages**.
</Tip>
</Info>
* **includeBarcode**: True/False
* **data**: A map containing the values that should be replaced in the document template (data that comes from user input). The keys used in the map should match the ones defined in the HTML template and your UI elements.
Ultimately, the configuration should resemble the presented image:

5. Configure the third node (Receive Message Task):
* Add the topic where the response will be sent; in our example `ai.flowx.updates.document.html.generate.v1` and its key: `generatedDocuments`
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/generate_template_receive.png)
</Frame>
## Receiving the document generation reply
The response, containing information about the generated documents, is sent to the output Kafka topic defined in the Kafka Receive Event Node. The response includes details such as file IDs, document types, and storage paths.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/html_generated_response.png)
</Frame>
Here is an example of a response after generation (received on `generatedDocuments` key):
```json
{
"generatedFiles": {
"ClientsFolder": {
"AccountCreation": {
"customId": "ClientsFolder",
"fileId": "320f4ec2-a509-4aa9-b049-87224594802e",
"documentType": "AccountCreation",
"documentLabel": "GENERATED_PDF",
"minioPath": "{{your_bucket}}/2024/2024-01-15/process-id-865759/ClientsFolder/6869_AccountCreation.pdf",
"downloadPath": "internal/files/320f4ec2-a509-4aa9-b049-87224594802e/download",
"noOfPages": 1,
"error": null
}
}
},
"error": null
}
```
* **generatedFiles**: List of generated files.
* **customId**: Client ID.
* **fileId**: The ID of the generated file.
* **documentType**: The name of the document template.
* **documentLabel**: A label or description for the document.
* **minioPath**: The path where the converted file is saved. It represents the location of the file in the storage system, whether it's a MinIO path or an S3 path, depending on the specific storage solution.
* **downloadPath**: The download path for the converted file. It specifies the location from where the file can be downloaded.
* **noOfPages**: The number of pages in the generated file.
* **error**: If there were any errors encountered during the generation process, they would be specified here. In the provided example, the value is null, indicating no errors.
## Displaying the generated document
Upon document generation, you now have the capability to present it using the Document Preview UI element. To facilitate this, let's optimize the existing process by introducing two supplementary nodes:
* **Task node**: This node is designated to generate the document path from the storage solution, specifically tailored for the Document Preview.
* **User task**: In this phase, we seamlessly integrate the Document Preview UI Element. Here, we incorporate a key that contains the download path generated in the preceding node.
For detailed instructions on displaying a generated or uploaded document, refer to the example provided in the following section:

# Getting URLs
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/getting-urls-to-documents
In certain scenarios, obtaining URLs pointing to uploaded documents for use in integrations is essential. This process involves adding a custom action to your workflow that requests URLs from the Documents plugin.
## Prerequisites
Before retrieving document URLs, ensure:
1. **Access Permissions**: Ensure that the user account has the necessary access rights.
2. **Kafka Configuration**:
* **Verify Kafka Setup**: Ensure proper configuration and accessibility of the Kafka messaging system.
* **Kafka Topics**: Understand the Kafka topics used for these operations.
3. **Document Types**: Prepare information for updating or deleting files:
* `types`: A list of document types.
## Configuring the getting URLs process
<Frame>

</Frame>
To obtain document URLs, follow these steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create the process">
Create a process that will contain the following types of nodes:
* [**Send Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) - used to send the get URLs request
* [**Receive Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) - used to receive the get URLs reply
* [**User Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/user-task-node) - where you will perform the upload action
</Step>
<Step title="Configure the User Task">
Start configuring the **User Task** node:
#### Node Config
* **Data stream topics**: Add the topic where the response will be sent; in this example `ai.flowx.updates.document.html.persist.v1` and its key: `uploadedDocument`.

# Listing stored files
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/listing-stored-files
If you are using an S3-compatible cloud storage solution such as MinIO, the stored files are organized into buckets. A bucket serves as a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. The Documents Plugin provides a REST API that allows you to easily view the files stored in the buckets.
To determine the partitioning strategy used for storing generated documents, you can access the following key in the configuration:
`application.file-storage.partition-strategy`
```yaml
application:
defaultLocale: en
supportedLocales: en, ro
#fileStorageType is the configuration that activates one FileContentService implementation. Valid values: minio / fileSystem
file-storage:
type: s3
disk-directory: MS_SVC_DOCUMENT
partition-strategy: NONE
```
The `partition-strategy` property can have two possible values:
* **NONE**: In this case, documents are saved in separate buckets for each process instance, following the previous method.
**PROCESS\_DATE**: Documents are saved in a single bucket with a subfolder structure based on the process date. For example: `bucket/2022/2022-07-04/process-id-xxxx/customer-id/file.pdf`.
## REST API
The Documents Plugin provides the following REST API endpoints for interacting with the stored files:
### List buckets
<Check>
Check out the [**List buckets API reference**](/4.0/docs/api/list-buckets) for more details.
</Check>
* This endpoint returns a list of available buckets.
### List objects in a bucket
<Check>
Check out the [**List objects in a bucket API reference**](/4.0/docs/api/list-objects-in-buckets) for more details.
</Check>
* This endpoint retrieves a list of objects stored within a specific bucket. Replace `BUCKET_NAME` with the actual name of the desired bucket
### Download file
<Check>
Check out the [**Download file API reference**](/4.0/docs/api/download-file.mdx) for more details.
</Check>
* This endpoint allows you to download a file by specifying its path or key.
# Managing templates
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/managing-html-templates
The Documents plugin provides the flexibility to define and manage HTML templates for document generation, enabling customization through various parameter types.
Additionally, the platform incorporates a [**What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)**](../../wysiwyg) editor, allowing users to have a real-time, visual representation of the document or content during the editing process. Furthermore, you have the capability to test and review your template by downloading it as a PDF.
<Tip>
A WYSIWYG editor, typically provides two main views:
* **Design View (Visual View)**: In this view, you can see a visual representation of their content as it would appear when rendered in a web browser or other output medium. It resembles the final output closely, allowing you to format text, add images, and apply styles directly within the visual interface. This view aims to provide a real-time preview of the document's appearance.
* **HTML View (Source View)**: In this view, you can see and edit the underlying HTML code that corresponds to the content displayed in the Design View. It shows the raw HTML markup, providing a more detailed and technical representation of the document. You can manually edit the HTML code to make precise adjustments or to implement features not available in the visual interface.
</Tip>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/wysiwyg_example.gif)
Explore the different parameter types and their specifications:
## Configuring HTML templates
In the following example, we will create an example of a template using the HTML View (Source View).
To create a document template, navigate to the **Document Templates** section in the **Designer**, select ”**New document**” from the menu in the top-right corner, name your template, and click **Create**.
Now follow the next steps to design a new template:
1. **Open the WYSIWYG editor**:
Access the WYSIWYG editor within the Document Management Plugin, found in the **FlowX Designer → Plugins → Document templates** section.
* **Language Configuration**: Create a dedicated template for each language specified in your system.
<Check>
To confirm the installed languages on the platform, go to **FLOWX.AI Designer → Content Management → Languages**.
</Check>
2. **Design the document header**:
Begin by creating a header section for the document, including details such as the company logo and title.
```html
<!-- Source: -->
<header>
<img src="https://d22tnnndi9lo60.cloudfront.net/devmain/flowx/flowxlogo/1669299027205_FLOWX.AI%20main%20logo.png" alt="Company Logo" width="150px" height="auto">
<h1 th:text="${offerTitle}">Offer Document</h1>
</header>
```
Data specifications (process data):
```json
"data": {
"companyLogo": "INSERT_BASE64_IMAGE",
"offerTitle": "Client Offer"
}
```
3. **Text Parameters for Client Information**:

}
```
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/table_offer.png)
</Frame>
5. **Dynamic sections for certain conditions:**
Dynamic sections allow displaying specific content based on certain conditions. For example, you can display a paragraph only when a certain condition is met.
```html
<!-- Source: -->
<section>
<h2>Dynamic Sections for Certain Conditions</h2>
<span th:if="${isPreferredClient}"> </span>
<p><span th:if="${isPreferredClient}">This is displayed if it is a preferred client. They are eligible for special discounts!&nbsp;</span></p>
<span th:if="${isPreferredClient}"> </span> <span th:if="${hasSpecialRequest}"> </span>
<p><span th:if="${hasSpecialRequest}">This is displayed if the client has specific requests. Please review them carefully.</span></p>
<span th:if="${hasSpecialRequest}"> </span> <span th:if="${isActiveContract}"> </span>
<p><span th:if="${isActiveContract}">This is displayed if the client has an active contract with us.</span></p>
<span th:if="${isActiveContract}"> </span></section>
```
Data specifications:
```json
"data": {
"clientName": "John Doe",
"clientId": "JD123456",
"isPreferredClient": false,
"hasSpecialRequest": false,
"isActiveContract": true
}
```
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/display_conditions.png)
</Frame>
6. **Lists**:
Lists are useful for displaying values from selected items in a checkbox as a bulleted list.
```html
<!-- Source: -->
<section>
<div th:if="${incomeSource != null}">
<h3>Income source:</h3>
<ul>
<li th:each="item : ${incomeSource}" th:text="${item}"></li>
</ul>

</Frame>
## Styling
HTML template styling plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal, readability, and user experience of generated documents.
We will apply the following styling to the previously created HTML template using **Source** view of the editor.
```css
<style type="text/css">body {
font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
margin: 20px;
color: #343a40;
}
header {
text-align: center;
}
header img {
width: 150px;
height: auto;
}
h1 {

# Splitting documents
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/splitting-a-document
You can split a document into multiple parts using the Documents plugin.
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to split a document, such as when a user uploads a bulk scanned file that needs to be separated into distinct files.
## Prerequisites
1. **Access Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the Documents Plugin. The user account used for these operations should have the required access rights.
2. **Kafka Configuration**: Verify that the Kafka messaging system is properly configured and accessible. The Documents Plugin relies on Kafka for communication between nodes.
* **Kafka Topics**: Familiarize yourself with the Kafka topics used for these operations (later in this section)
3. Before initiating the splitting process, ensure you have the unique ID of the file in the storage solution. This ensures that the splitting is performed on an already uploaded file.
<Check>
Ensure that the uploaded document contains more than one file.
</Check>
You have two options to obtain the file ID:
* Extract the file ID from a [**Response Message**](./uploading-a-new-document#response-message-example-2) of an upload file request. For more details, refer to the [**upload process documentation**](./uploading-a-new-document).
* Extract the file ID from a [**Response Message**](./generating-from-html-templates#receiving-the-document-generation-reply) of a generate from template request. For more details, refer to the [**document generation reply documentation**](./generating-from-html-templates).
<Info>
In the following example, we will use the `fileId` generated for a document with multiple files using [**Uploading a New Document**](./uploading-a-new-document) scenario.
```json
{
"customId": "119407",
"fileId": "446c69fb-32d2-44ba-a0b2-02dbb55e7eea",
"documentType": "BULK",
"documentLabel": null,
"minioPath": "flowx-dev-process-id-119407/119407/465_BULK.pdf",
"downloadPath": "internal/files/446c69fb-32d2-44ba-a0b2-02dbb55e7eea/download",
"noOfPages": null,
"error": null
}
```
</Info>
## Configuring the splitting process
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/split_document.png)
To create a process that splits a document into multiple parts, follow these steps:
1. Create a process that includes a [**Send Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#configuring-a-message-send-task-node) node and a [**Receive Message Task (Kafka)**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#configuring-a-message-receive-task-node) node:
* Use the **Send Message Task** node to send the splitting request.
* Use the **Receive Message Task** node to receive the splitting reply.
2. Configure the **first node (Send Message Task)** by adding a **Kafka Send Action**.
3. Specify the [**Kafka topic**](../../../../../setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/documents-plugin-setup#kafka-configuration) where you want to send the splitting request.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/kafka_split_topic.png)
</Frame>
<Tip>
To identify your defined topics in your current environment, follow the next steps:
1. From the FLOWX.AI main screen, navigate to the Platform Status menu at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. In the FLOWX Components list, scroll to the document-plugin-mngt line and press the eye icon on the right side.
3. In the details screen, expand the `KafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator` line and then **details → configuration → topic → document → split**. Here you will find the in and out topics for splitting documents.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/kafka_topics_split.png)
</Tip>
4. Fill in the body of the message request.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/split_kafka_action.png)
</Frame>
#### Message request example
```json
{
"parts": [
{
"documentType": "BULK",
"customId": "119407",
"pagesNo": [
1,
2
],
"shouldOverride": true
}
],
"fileId": "446c69fb-32d2-44ba-a0b2-02dbb55e7eea"
}
```
* **fileId**: The file ID of the document that will be split
* **parts**: A list containing information about the expected document parts
* **documentType**: The document type.
* **customId**: The unique identifier for your document (it could be for example the ID of a client)
* **shouldOverride**: A boolean value (true or false) indicating whether to override an existing document if one with the same name already exists
* **pagesNo**: The pages that you want to separate from the document
5. Configure the **second node (Receive Message Task)** by adding a Data stream topic:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/split_response_kafka.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
The response will be sent to this `..out` Kafka topic.
</Info>
## Receiving the reply
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/split_response.png)
</Frame>
The following values are expected in the reply body:
* **docs**: A list of documents.
* **customId**: The unique identifier for your document (matching the name of the folder in the storage solution where the document is uploaded).
* **fileId**: The ID of the file.
* **documentType**: The document type.
* **minioPath**: The storage path for the document.
* **downloadPath**: The download path for the document.
* **noOfPages**: The number of pages in the document.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
* **Access Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the Documents Plugin. The user account used for these operations should have the required access rights.
* **Kafka Configuration**: Verify that the Kafka messaging system is properly configured and accessible. The Documents Plugin relies on Kafka for communication between nodes.
* **Kafka Topics**: Familiarize yourself with the Kafka topics used for these operations (later in this section).
To upload a document using this process, follow the steps outlined below.
## Step-by-step guide: uploading an previewing a document
In the [previous section](./generating-from-html-templates), you learned how to generate documents from HTML templates. This section focuses on creating a process where users can generate a document, review and sign it, and subsequently upload it.
<Frame>
<video controls autoPlay muted loop src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/upload_and_preview.mp4" />
</Frame>
### Process overview
This process involves several key nodes, each performing specific tasks to ensure smooth document creation, preview, and upload:
* **Start and End Nodes**: These nodes mark the beginning and end of the process, respectively.
* **User Task Node**: Collects user input necessary for document generation.
* **Send and Receive Message Tasks (Kafka)**: Handle communication with Kafka for generating the document and retrieving it after processing.
* **Service Task Node**: Appends the path of the generated document to the process, enabling further actions.
* **User Task Nodes**: Facilitate the preview of the generated document and manage the upload of the signed document.
## Configuring the process
<Steps>
<Step title="Document generation">
Follow the steps outlined in [**Generating from HTML templates**](./generating-from-html-templates) configure the document generation part of the process.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/doc_plugin_upload_prev_ex.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
If you only need to upload a new file without generating it from templates, skip the template generation steps.
</Info>
After configuration, your request and response messages should resemble the examples below.
#### Request message example
This JSON structure represents a Kafka message sent through the `..in` topic to initiate a request in the Process Engine. It includes information for generating an "AccountCreation" document with a custom ID "119237" in English. Data specifies client details extracted dynamically from user input (first name, last name, age, country) and company information (name, registration date).
<Info>
This an example of a message that follows the custom integration data model.
</Info>
```json
{
"documentList": [
{
"customId": "119246", //this will match the name of the folder in the storage solution
"templateName": "AccountCreation",
"language": "en",
"data": {
"application": {
"client": {
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Doe",
"age": "33",
"country": "AU"
},
"company": {
"name": "ACME",
"registrationDate": "24.01.2024"
}
}
},
"includeBarcode": false
}
]
}
```
#### Response message example
This JSON structure represents the response received on the `..out` Kafka topic, where the Process Engine expects a reply. It contains details about the generated PDF file corresponding to the custom ID "119237" and the "AccountCreation" template. The response provides file-related information such as file ID, document type, document label, storage path, download path, number of pages, and any potential errors (null if none). The paths provided in the response facilitate access and download of the generated PDF file.
```json
{
"generatedFiles": {
"119246": {
"AccountCreation": {
"customId": "119246",

if(downloadPath != null){
output.put("generatedDocuments", {
"filePath" : adminPath + downloadPath
});
}
```
<Accordion title="Explanation of MVEL code">
* **adminPath**: Base URL for the admin path.
```java
adminPath = "https://admin-main.playground.flowxai.dev/document/";
```
* **processInstanceId**: Extracts the process instance ID from the input. Assumes an input structure with a generatedDocuments property containing a generatedFiles property. Retrieves the keys, converts them to an array, and selects the first element.
```java
processInstanceId = input.?generatedDocuments.?generatedFiles.keySet().toArray()[0];
```
* **downloadPath**: Retrieves the downloadPath property using the obtained processInstanceId.
```java
downloadPath = input.?generatedDocuments.?generatedFiles.?get(processInstanceId).Company_Client_Document.downloadPath;`
```
* **if condition**: Checks if downloadPath is not null and constructs a new object in the output map.
```java
if(downloadPath != null){
output.put("generatedDocuments", {
"filePath" : adminPath + downloadPath
});
}
```
</Accordion>
### User Task
Now we will configure the user task to preview the generated document.
#### Actions
Configure the **Actions edit** section:
* **Action Type**: Set to **Save Data**.

The screen where you can preview and download the generated document:
![Preview Document](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/preview_document_vis.gif)
</Step>
<Step title="Upload document">
Configure the user task where we will upload the signed document genereated from the previous document template.
#### Node Config
* **Swimlane**: Choose a swimlane (if multiple) to restrict access to specific user roles.
* **Stage**: Assign a stage to the node.
* **Data stream topics**: Add the topic where the response will be sent; in this example `ai.flowx.updates.document.html.persist.v1` and its key: `uploadedDocument`.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/upload_document_node_config.png)
</Frame>
#### Actions
Configure the following node actions:
* Upload File action with two child actions:
* Business Rule
* Send Data to User Interface
* Save Data action
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/upload_document_actions.png)
</Frame>
#### Upload file action
This is a standard predefined FlowX Node Action for uploading files. This is done through Kafka and by using `persist` topics.
<Accordion title="Configuring the File Upload action">
#### Action edit
* **Action Type**: Set to **Upload File**.
* **Trigger Type**: Choose **Manual** to allow user-triggered action.
* **Required Type**: Set it as **Optional**.
* **Repeatable**: Check this option if the action can be triggered multiple times.
#### Parameters
* **Topics**: Kafka topic where the file will be posted, in this example `ai.flowx.in.document.persist.v1`.
<Tip>
To identify your defined topics in your current environment, follow the next steps:
* From the FLOWX.AI main screen, navigate to the **Platform Status** menu at the bottom of the left sidebar.
* In the FLOWX Components list, scroll to the **document-plugin-mngt** line and press the eye icon on the right side.
* In the details screen, expand the `KafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator` line and then **details → configuration → topic → document → persist**. Here will find the in and out topics for persisting (uploading documents).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/kafka_topics_persist.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>
* **Document Type**: Metadata for the document plugin, in this example `BULK`.
* **Folder**: Configure a value by which the file will be identified, in this example it will be the`${processInstanceId}` (it will be replaced at runtime with a generated process instance id).
* **Advanced configuration (Show headers)**: This represents a JSON value that will be sent on the headers of the Kafka message, in this example:
```json
{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}, "destinationId": "upload_document", "callbacksForAction": "uploadDocument"}`
```
<Tip>
`callbacksForAction` - the value of this key is a string that specifies a callback action associated with the "upload\_document" destination ID (node). This is part of an event-driven system (Kafka send action) where this callback will be called once the "upload\_document" action is completed.
</Tip>
#### Data to send
* **Keys**: Used when data is sent from the frontend via an action for data validation.
</Accordion>
<Frame>

</Frame>
Now, configure the child actions of Upload File Action.
#### Business rule
This is necessary to create the path to display the uploaded document.
<Accordion title="Configuring the Business Rule action">
**Action Edit**
* **Order**: Set to **1** so it will be processed before the second child action.
* **Action Type**: Set to **Upload File**.
* **Trigger Type**: Choose **Automatic**, it does not need user intervention.
* **Required Type**: Set as **Mandatory**.
* **Repeatable**: Check this option if the action can be triggered multiple times.

```js
adminPath = "https://admin-main.playground.flowxai.dev/document/";
downloadPath = input.?uploadedDocument.?downloadPath;
if(downloadPath != null){
output.put("uploadedDocument", {
"filePath" : adminPath + downloadPath

* **minioPath**: The path where the uploaded file is saved. It represents the location of the file in the storage system, whether it's a MinIO path or an S3 path, depending on the specific storage solution.
* **downloadPath**: The download path for the uploaded file. It specifies the location from where the file can be downloaded.
* **noOfPages**: The number of pages in the document (if applicable).
* **filePath**: The path to the file that we built in our example so we can display the document.
# Forwarding notifications
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/forwarding-notifications-to-an-external-system
If the Notification service is not directly connected to an SMTP / SMS server and you want to use an external system for sending the notifications, you can use the notification plugin just to forward the notifications to your custom implementation.
### Check needed Kafka topics
Yu will need the name of the kafka topics defined at the following environment variables:
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_IN` - topic used to trigger the request to send a notification
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_EXTERNAL_OUT` - the notification will be forwarded on this topic to be handled by an external system
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_OUT` - topic used for sending replies after sending the notification
<Tip>
You can check the defined topics by going to **FlowX Designer > Platform Status > notification-plugin-mngt > kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator > details > configuration > topic > notification**.
</Tip>
### Example: send a notification from a business flow
Let's pick a simple use case. Imagine we need to send a new welcome letter when we onboard a new customer. You must follow the next steps:
1. Configure the [template](./managing-notification-templates) that you want to use for the welcome email, use the [WYSIWYG Editor](../../wysiwyg)
<Check>
Make sure that the **Forward on Kafka** checkbox is ticked, so the notification will be forwarded to an external adapter.
</Check>
2. Configure the data model for the template.
3. To configure a document template, first, you need to define some information stored in the [Body](../../wysiwyg#notification-templates):
* **Type** - MAIL (for email notifications)
* ❗️**Forward on Kafka** - if this box is checked, the notification is not being sent directly by the plugin to the destination, but forwarded to another adapter
* **Language** - choose the language for your notification template
* **Subject** - enter a subject
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notification_email.png)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/data_model_notif.png)
4. Use the FlowX Designer to create a process definition.
5. Add a [**Send Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#configuring-a-message-send-task-node) and a [**Receive Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#configuring-a-message-receive-task-node) (one to send the request, one to receive the reply).
6. Check if the needed topic (defined at the following environment variable) is configured correctly: `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_IN`.
7. Add the proper configuration to the action, the Kafka topic, and the body message.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notif_params_send.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
**Forward on Kafka** option will forward the notification to an external adapter, make sure the needed Kafka topic for forwarding is defined/overwritten using the following environment variable: `KAFKA_TOPIC_EXTERNAL_OUT`.
</Info>
7. Run the process and look for the response (you can view it via the **Audit log**) or by checking the responses on the Kafka topic
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notif_send_resp.png)

### Configuring a template
To configure a document template, first, you need to select some information stored in the **Body**:
1. **Type** - could be either MAIL or SMS notifications
2. [**Forward on Kafka**](./forwarding-notifications-to-an-external-system) - if this checkbox is ticked, the notification is not being sent directly by the plugin to the destination, but forwarded to another adapter (this is mandatory for SMS notifications templates, as they require an external adapter)
3. **Language** - choose the language for your notification template
4. **Subject** - enter a subject
<Frame>
![Notification template](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notifications_template.png)

#### Editing the content
You can edit the content of a notification template by using the [WYSIWYG](../../wysiwyg) editor embedded in the body of the notification templates body.
### Configuring the data model
Using the **Data model** tab, you can define key pair values (parameters) that will be displayed and reused in the editor. Multiple parameters can be added:
* STRING
* NUMBER
* BOOLEAN
* OBJECT
* ARRAY (which has an additional `item` field)
<Frame>
![Data model](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notifications_data_model.png)

# Notifications plugin
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/notifications-plugin-overview
Notifications plugin can be easily added to your custom FlowX.AI deployment. The plugin will **enhance the core platform capabilities with functionality specific to sending various notifications**.
You have the possibility to send various types of notifications:
* Email notifications
* SMS templates to mobile devices
<Info>
To use the plugin to send notifications, via SMS channel, a third party provider for SMS communication is needed, for example, [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
</Info>
* Forward custom notifications to external outgoing services
* Generate and validate OTP passwords for user identity verification
You can also use the plugin to track what notifications have been sent and to whom.
Let's go through the steps needed to deploy and set up the plugin:
## Using Notifications plugin
After deploying the notifications plugin in your infrastructure, you can start sending notifications by configuring related actions in your **process definitions**.
Before adding the corresponding **actions** in your process definition, you will need to follow a few steps:
* make sure all prerequisites are prepared, for example, the [notification templates](./managing-notification-templates) you want to use
* the database is configured properly
* for each **Kafka** event type, you will need two Kafka topics:
* one for the request sent from the FlowX Engine to the Notifications plugin
* one for the corresponding reply
<Card title="Kafka configuration for Notifications plugin" href="../../../../../setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/notifications-plugin-setup#kafka-configuration" icon="gears">
**DEVELOPER**
</Card>
<Info>
The topic names configured for the plugin should match the ones used when configuring the engine and when adding plugin-related process actions:
* FlowX Engine is listening for messages on topics with names of a certain pattern, make sure to use an outgoing topic name that matches the pattern configured in the Engine
More details: [here](../../../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#configuring-kafka)
* to make a request to the plugin, the process definition needs to have an action of type `Kafka send` that has an action parameter with key `topicName` and the needed topic name as a value
* to receive a reply from the plugin, the process definition needs to have a receiving node with a node value with key `topicName` and the topic name as the value
</Info>
After all the setup is in place, you can start adding custom actions to the processes.
Let's go through a few examples. These examples cover both the configuration part, and the integration with the engine for all the use cases.

# Generate OTP
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/otp-flow/generate-otp
There are some cases when you will need to generate an OTP (One Time Password) from a business flow, for example when validating an email account.
The notifications plugin handles both the actual OTP code generation and sending the code to the user using a defined [notification template](../managing-notification-templates).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/otp_archi.png)
## Define needed Kafka topics
<Info>
**DEVELOPER**: Kafka topic names can be set/found by using the following environment variables in your Notifications plugin deployment:
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_IN`
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_OUT` - after the OTP is generated and sent to the user, this is the topic used to send the response back to the Engine.
</Info>
<Info>
The Engine is listening for messages on topics with names of a certain pattern, make sure to use an outgoing topic name that matches the pattern configured in the Engine.
</Info>
## Request to generate an OTP
Values expected in the request body:
* **templateName**: the name of the notification template that is used (created using the [WYSIWYG](../../../wysiwyg) editor)
* **channe**l: notification channel (SMS / MAIL)
* **recipient**: notification receiver: email / phone number
* **notification template content parameters (for example, clientId)**: parameters that should be replaced in the [notification template](../managing-notification-templates)

* **processInstanceId** = process instance ID
* **clientId** = the client id (in this case the SSN number of the client)
* **channel** = notification channel used
* **otpSent** = confirmation if the notification was sent: true or false
* **error** = error description, if any
**Example:**

## Example: generate an OTP from a business flow
It is important to identify what is the business identifier that you are going to use to validate that OTP, it can be, for example, a user identification number.
1. Configure the templates that you want to use (for example, an SMS template).
2. Make sure the Kafka communication through (`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_IN` topic - send the otp request) and the topic used to receive the response (`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_OUT`) is defined properly.
<Tip>
You can check the defined topics by going to **FlowX Designer > Platform Status > notification-plugin-mngt > kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator > details > configuration > topic > otp**.
</Tip>
3. Use the FlowX Designer to add a new **Kafka send event** to the correct node in the process definition.
4. Add the proper configuration to the action, the Kafka topic, and configure the body message.

# Handling OTP
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/otp-flow/otp-flow
The notifications plugin can also be used for handling the one time password (OTP) generation and validation flow.
The flow is made of two steps, the OTP generation and the OTP validation.
### OTP Configuration
The desired character size and expiration time of the generated one-time-passwords can also be configured using the following environment variables:
* `FLOWX_OTP_LENGTH`
* `FLOWX_OTP_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_SECONDS`
Let's go through the examples for both steps:
<Card title="Generate OTP" href="generate-otp" icon="link" />
<Card title="Validate OTP" href="validate-otp" icon="link" />
# Validate OTP
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/otp-flow/validate-otp
## Define needed Kafka topics
Kafka topic names can be set by using environment variables:
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_VALIDATE_IN` - the event sent on this topic (with an OTP and an identifier) will check if the OTP is valid
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_VALIDATE_OUT` - the response for this request will validate an OTP, the reply is sent back to the Engine on this topic
<Tip>
You can check the defined topics by going to **FlowX Designer > Platform Status > notification-plugin-mngt > kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator > details > configuration > topic > otp**.
</Tip>
<Info>
The Engine is listening for messages on topics with names of a certain pattern, make sure to use an outgoing topic name that matches the pattern configured in the Engine.
</Info>
## Request to validate an OTP
Values expected in the request body:
* **processInstanceId** = process instance ID
* **client id** = the user unique ID in the system
* **channel** = notification channel: SMS/MAIL
* **otp** = OTP code that you received, used to compare with the one that was sent from the system
Example:
```json
{
"processInstanceId": 12345,
"clientId": "1871201460101",
"channel": "MAIL",
"otp": "1111"
}
```
### Reply from validate OTP
Values expected in the reply body:
* **client id** = the user unique id in the system
* **channel** = notification channel used
* **otpValid** = confirmation if the provided OTP code was the same as the one sent from the system
Example:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/otp_validate_audit.png)
## Example: validate an OTP from a business flow
Similar to the generation of the OTP you can validate the OTP that was generated for an identifier.
1. Check that the needed topics are configured correctly: (`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_VALIDATE_IN` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_VALIDATE_OUT`)
2. Add the actions for sending the request to validate the OTP on the node that contains the 'Generate OTP' actions
3. Add the proper configuration to the action, the Kafka topic and configure the body message.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/validate_otp_temp.png)
</Frame>
4. Add a node to the process definition (for the [Receive Message Task](../../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#receive-message-task))
5. Configure on what key you want to receive the response on the process instance parameters

# Sending a notification
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/sending-a-notification
The plugin can be used for sending many kinds of notifications such as emails or SMS notifications. It can be easily integrated in one of your business processes.
## Configuring the process
To configure a business process that sends notifications you must follow the next steps:
* use **FlowX Designer**  to create/edit a [notification template](./managing-notification-templates)
* use **Process Designer** to add a [**Send Message Task**](/4.0/docs/building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node) and a [**Receive Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#receive-message-task)
* configure the needed node [actions](../../../../building-blocks/actions/actions)
* configure the request body
<Check>
**DEVELOPER**: Make sure the needed [Kafka topics](../../../../../setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/notifications-plugin-setup#kafka-configuration) are configured properly.
Kafka topic names can be set by using the following environment variables:
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_IN` - topic used to trigger the request to send a notification
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_OUT` - topic used for sending replies after sending the notification
</Check>
The following values are expected in the request body:
|      Key     |                                          Definition                                         |           |
| :----------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------: |

## Example: send a notification from a business flow
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/send_a_notification_proc.png)
Let's pick a simple use-case, say we need to send a new welcome letter when we onboard a new customer. The steps are the following:
1. Configure the template that you want to use for the welcome email, see the previous section, [Managing notification templates](./managing-notification-templates) for more information.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/send_a_notif_from_business_flow.gif)
2. Use the FlowX.AI Designer to add a [**Send Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#send-message-task) and a [**Receive Message Task**](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#receive-message-task).
3. On the **Send Message Task** add a proper configuration to the action, the Kafka topic and request body message to be sent:
* **Topics** - `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_IN` - (in our example, `flowx-notifications-qa`)
<Tip>
You can check the defined topics by going to **FlowX Designer > Platform Status > notification-plugin-mngt > kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator > details > configuration > topic > notifications**.
</Tip>
* **Message** (expected parameters):
* templateName
* channel
* language
* receivers
* **Headers** - it is always `{"processInstanceId": ${processInstanceId}}`
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notif_params_send.png)
</Frame>
4. On the **Receive Message Task** add the needed topic to receive the kafka response - `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_OUT` - (in our example, `ai.flowx.updates.qa.notification.request.v1`).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/generate_notif_receive.png)

5. Run the process and look for the response (you can view it via the **Audit log**) or checking the responses on the Kafka topic defined at `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_OUT` variable.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/notif_send_resp.png)
Response example at `KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_OUT`:
```json
{
"identifier": null,
"templateName": "welcomeLetter",
"language": "en",
"error": null
}
```
# Sending an email
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/sending-an-email-with-attachments
To use the notification plugin for sending emails with attachments, you must define the same topic configuration as for sending regular notifications. A notification template must be created, and the corresponding Kafka topics must be defined.
<Check>
Check first the [Send a notification](./sending-a-notification) section.
</Check>
## **Defining process actions**
### Example: send an email notification with attached files from a business flow
Let's pick a simple use-case. Imagine we need to send a copy of a contract signed by a new customer. Before setting the action for the notification, another action must be defined, so the first one will save the new contract using the documents plugin.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/send_email_notif_attach.jpeg)
</Frame>
<Card>
See the example from [<u>**Generating a document from template**</u>](../documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates) section
</Card>
The steps for sending the notification are the following:
<Steps>
<Step>
Configure the template that you want to use for the email, see the [Managing notification templates](./managing-notification-templates) section for more information.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the needed topics are defined by going to **`FlowX Designer > Platform Status > notification-plugin-mngt > kafkaTopicsHealthCheckIndicator > details > configuration > topic > notifications`**.
</Step>
<Step>
Use the **FlowX Designer** to add a new [Send Message Task (Kafka)](../../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#send-message-task) action to the correct node in the process definition.
</Step>
<Step>
Add the proper configuration to the action, the Kafka topic and message to be sent.
</Step>
</Steps>
The message to be sent to Kafka will look something like:
```json
{
"templateName" : "contractCopy",
"identifier" : "text",
"language": "en",
"receivers" : [ "someone@somewhere.com" ],
"contentParams" : {
"clientId" : "clientId",
"firstName" : "first",
"lastName" : "last"
},
"attachments" : [ {
"filename" : "contract",

# OCR plugin
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/ocr-plugin
The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) plugin is a powerful tool that enables you to read barcodes and extract handwritten signatures from .pdf documents with ease.
Before using the OCR service for reading barcodes and extracting signatures, please note the following requirements:
<Info>
* All \*.pdf documents that are sent to the OCR service for reading barcodes and extracting handwritten signatures should be scanned at a minimum resolution of 200DPI (approximately 1654x2339 px for A4 pages)
* Barcode is searched on the top 15% of each image (scanned page)
* Signatures are detected on boxes with a border: 4px black solid
* Only two signatures per image (scanned page) are detected.
</Info>
* All \*.pdf documents should be scanned at a minimum resolution of 200DPI (approximately 1654x2339 px for A4 pages).
* The barcode is searched in the top 15% of each scanned page.
* Signatures are detected within boxes with a 4px black solid border.
* The plugin detects up to two signatures per scanned page.
* Only two signatures per image (scanned page) are detected.
<Info>
The plugin supports **1D Code 128** barcodes. For more information about this barcode type, please refer to the documentation [here](https://graphicore.github.io/librebarcode/documentation/code128.html).
</Info>
## Using the OCR plugin
You can utilize the OCR plugin to process generic document templates by either using a specific flow on FLOWX.AI (HTML template) or any other document editor.
<Tip>
Using a specific flow on FlowX.AI offers several advantages:
* Centralized management of templates and flows within a single application.
* Access to template history and version control.
</Tip>
### Use case
1. Prepare and print generic document templates.
2. End-users complete, sign, and scan the documents.
3. Upload the scanned documents to the flow.
4. FlowX validates the template (barcode) and the signatures.
### Scenario for FlowX.AI generated documents
1. Utilize the [**Documents plugin**](./documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview) to create a [**document template**](./documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates).
<Card title="Generating documents based on templates" href="./documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates" icon="file" />
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/ocr_doc_template.gif)
2. Create a process and add a [**Kafka Send Action**](../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#configuring-a-message-send-task-node) to a [**Send Message Task**](../../../building-blocks/node/message-send-received-task-node#send-message-task) node. Here you specify the [**kafka topic**](../../../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts#topics) (address) where the template will be generated.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/ocr_kafka_send.png)

</Frame>
### Setting up reporting for a process definition
<Steps>
<Step title="Establish reporting data model to be extracted from process">
If you want to extract custom business parameters for a process, first you should set up the master reporting data model in the published version of that process. This is done in Designer, as explained below in the [**Reporting Data Model**](#reporting-data-model).
The master reporting data model that is applied to all historical versions is the one belonging to the version that is set as Published. If the currently published version is read-only, you might need to create a new version, create the data model in it, mark it for reporting and set it as published (as explained in the section below).
See [**Reporting Data Model**](#reporting-data-model) section for more details.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable reporting on the process versions to be reported">
This is accomplished by checking the “Use process in reporting” button in the settings / general page of each process version you want to report. Please note that you will not be able to change that setting on read-only versions.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/use_proc_reporting.gif)
</Frame>
It is essential that the currently Published version has this setting enabled, as it is the master version for reporting all historical data.
Only the process instances belonging to reporting-enabled versions will be extracted to the database, using the master data model from the currently Published version.
<Info>
The reason why you should first set up the data model on the published (or to-be-published) version is that all changes in the data model of the published version that is also marked “use\_in\_reporting” are instantly sent to the reporting plugin, potentially causing all historical process instances to be re-computed multiple times before you are done setting up the data model.
</Info>
To optimize operations, you should always aim to finish the modifications on the master data model on a version that is either not published, or not marked as "use\_in\_reporting", before marking it as "use\_in\_reporting and ensuring it is published.
See [**Enabling Process Reporting**](#enabling-process-reporting) section for more details.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Reporting data model
<Info>
You can only create or modify the reporting data model in non-committed versions, as commited versions are read-only.
</Info>
1. Open the branch view.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep1.png)
</Frame>
2. If the currently published version is read-only, start a new version.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep5.png)
</Frame>
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep6.png)
</Frame>
3. Make sure the new work-in-progress branch is selected, then go back to the process definition page.
4. Click on the Data Model icon and navigate in the object model to the target parameters.
5. Set up the business data structure to be reported by using the Edit button for each parameter.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep8.png)
</Frame>
* Check "Use in reporting" flag.
* Select the parameter type (number, string, Boolean or array).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep9.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
There are three parameter structures that you can report:
**Singleton** or primitive, for which a single value is saved for each process instance. They can be of the types number, string or Boolean and will all be found in the reporting table named `params_{process_alias}`.
**Array of primitives**, in which several rows are saved for each process instance, in a dedicated table (one value per row).
**Array of objects**, in which the system extracts one or more “leaves” from each object of an array of objects. Also saved as a dedicated table.
</Info>
### Primitive parameters reporting
In the following example, there are 3 simple parameters that will be extracted: `loan_approvalFee`, `loan_currency` and `loan_downPayment`.
They will be reported in the table `params_{process_alias}`, one row per instance.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep10.png)
### Arrays of primitives reporting
In the following example, the applicant can submit more than one email address, so each email will be extracted to a separate row in a dedicated table in the reporting database.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep11.png)
<Warning>
Extracting arrays is computationally intensive, do not use them if the only purpose is just to aggregate them afterward. Aggregation should be performed in the process, not in the reporting stage.
</Warning>
### Array of objects reporting
In this example, the applicant can have several real estate assets, so a subset of data items (`currentValue`, `mortgageBalance`, `propertyType`) will be extracted for each one of them.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep12.png)
<Warning>
Extracting arrays of objects is even more is computationally intensive, do not use them if the only purpose is just to aggregate them afterward. Aggregation should be performed in the process, not in the reporting stage.
</Warning>
## Enabling process reporting
Enable reporting by checking the “Use process in reporting” button on the settings/general page of each process version.
<Info>
You can also make data model changes on an already published version (if it is not set as read-only), but the effects of the changes are immediate and every periodic refresh will try to re-compute all historical instances to adapt to the changing data model, potentially taking a lot of computing.
</Info>
* Only the versions marked for reporting will be extracted to the database, using the master data model from the published version.
* Modifying the data model of a process version has no impact until the moment the version becomes published and is also set to "use\_in\_reporting".
* You can add / remove older process versions to be reported by opening the process branch modal, selecting the version, closing the branch modal, and then selecting Settings in the left bar, then in the General tab switching “Use process in reporting” on or off. You might not be able to do this on committed (read-only) versions.
The reporting refresh schedule is set for a fixed interval (currently 5 minutes):
* No processing overlaps are allowed. If processing takes more than 5 minutes, the next processing is automatically postponed until the current one is finished.
* The number of Spark executors is automatically set by the reporting plugin depending on the volume of data to be processed, up to a certain fixed limit that is established in the cloud environment. This limit can be adapted depending on your needs.
* Rebuilding the whole history for a process (if the master data model, process name or the Published version change) typically takes more time. It is better to make these changes after the working hours.
## Process reporting modification scenarios
**Modifying the data model for the Published version** causes all data for that process to be deleted from the database and to be rebuilt from scratch using the Data Model of the current Published version.
* This includes deleting process-specific array tables and rebuilding them, possibly with different names.
* All historical instances from previous versions are also rebuilt using the most recent Published data model.
* This may take a lot of time, so it is better to perform these operations during periods of low system use.
<Info>
The same thing happens whenever the Published version changes, or if the process name is modified.
</Info>
**Adding Process Versions**: Adds new rows to existing tables.
**Removing Non-Published Process Versions** from reporting (by unchecking their “Use in reporting” switch in Settings) simply deletes their corresponding rows from the table.
**Removing the Currently Published Version from Reporting**: **Not advisable** as it applies a random older data model and deletes all instances processed with this version.
**Reporting Data Structure Obsolescence and Backwards Compatibility**: The master data model is applied to all historical data from all reported versions. If only the name of a parameter changes, the plugin uses its UUID to map the old name to the new one. However, if the full path changes or the parameter does not exist in an older version, it returns a `Null` value to the database.
## Reporting database
### Main tables
Common fields for joins:
* `inst_id`: Unique identifier for each process instance
* `query_time`: Timestamp for when the plugin extracts data
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/rep20.png)
</Frame>
**Useful fields from instances table**:
* `date_started/finished` timestamps
* `process_alias` (process name with "\_" instead of spaces)
<Info>
The published version alias will be used for all the reported versions.
</Info>
* State of the process (started, finished, etc.)
* `context_name`: Useful if the process is started by another process
**Useful fields from current\_nodes table**:
* `node_started/finished` timestamps for the nodes
* `node_name`, `node_type`
* `swimlane` of the current node
* `prev_node_end`: For calculating when a token is waiting for another process branch
**Useful fields from token\_history table**:
Similar to `current_nodes` but includes all nodes in the instance history.
### Parameters and object tables
Common fields, on which the joins are built:
* `inst_id`, unique identifier for each process instance
* `query_time`, recorded at the moment the plugin extracts data from the database
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/reporting30.png)
</Frame>
For the `params_` table, there is a single row per process instance. For arrays and arrays of objects tables, there are multiple rows per process instance.
## Using Superset for data exploration

# WYSIWYG editor
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/wysiwyg
FlowX Designer's WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") editor enables you to create and modify notification and document templates without the need for complicated coding from the developers. WYSIWYG editors make the creation/editing of any type of document or notification easier for the end-user.
Displaying how the document will be published or printed on the screen, the user can adjust the text, graphics, photos, or other document/notification elements before generating the final output.
## WYSIWYG Components
### Header
The formatting head of the editor allows users to manipulate/format the content of the document.
### Body
The Body is the main part of the editor where you can edit your template.
<Tip>
After you defined some parameters in the **Data Model** tab, you can type "**#**" in the body to trigger a dropdown where you can choose which one you want to use.
</Tip>
### Source
The **Source** button can be used to switch to the HTML editor. You can use the HTML view/editor as a debugging tool, or you can edit the template directly by writing code here.
![Source Code](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/wysiwyg_source.gif)
## Document Templates
One of the main features of the [document management plugin](./custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview) is the ability to generate new documents based on custom templates and prefilled with data related to the current process instance.
![Document template](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/wysiwyg_document_template.png)
<Card title="Documents plugin" href="./custom-plugins/documents-plugin/documents-plugin-overview" icon="file" />
## Notification Templates
Notification WYSIWYG body has some additional fields (other than documents template):
* **Type** - that could be either MAIL or SMS (SMS, only if there is an external adapter)
* **Forward on Kafka** - if this box is checked, the notification is not being sent directly by the plugin to the destination, but forwarded to another adapter
![Notification template](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/wysiwyg_notif_template.png)
<Card title="Managing notifications templates" href="./custom-plugins/notifications-plugin/managing-notification-templates" icon="file" />
## Data Model
Using the data model, you can define key pair values (parameters) that will be displayed and reused in the body. Multiple parameters can be added:
* STRING
* NUMBER
* BOOLEAN
* OBJECT
* ARRAY (which has an additional `item` field)
![Data model](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/wysiwyg_data_model.png)

* Keycloak versions older than 26
* Kafka versions older than 3.9
* Redis versions older than 7.4
</Warning>
### Summary
#### Keycloak
Keycloak is an open-source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services.
[Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation)
#### **Kafka**
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.
Kafka is a unified platform for handling all the real-time data feeds. Kafka supports low latency message delivery and gives a guarantee for fault tolerance in the presence of machine failures. It has the ability to handle a large number of diverse consumers.
Kafka is very fast and performs 2 million writes/sec. Kafka persists all data to the disk, which essentially means that all the writes go to the page cache of the OS (RAM). This makes it very efficient to transfer data from a page cache to a network socket.
[Intro to Kafka](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kafka-concepts)
[Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
#### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
[PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
#### MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional [schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema).
Used by FlowX to store business process data and configuration information on the core/plugin components.
[MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
#### Redis
Redis is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store that is commonly used as a cache to store frequently accessed data in memory so that applications can be responsive to users.
It delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for applications.
It is also be used as a Pub/Sub messaging solution, allowing messages to be passed to channels and for all subscribers to that channel to receive that message. This feature enables information to flow quickly through the platform without using up space in the database as messages are not stored.
It is used by FLOWX.AI for caching the process definitions-related data.
[Intro to Redis](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-redis)
[Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/)
#### NGINX
Nginx Is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
FLOWX utilizes the Nginx engine as a load balancer and for routing the web traffic (API calls) from the SPA (single page application) to the backend service, to the engine, and to various plugins.
The FLOWX.AI Designer SPA will use the backend service to manage the platform via REST calls, will use API calls to manage specific content for the plugins, and will use REST and SSE calls to connect to the engine.
[Intro to NGINX](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-nginx)
[NGINX documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)
#### EFK (Elastic Search, Fluentd, Kibana)
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases.
As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning-fast search, fine‑tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.
Used by FLOWX.AI in the core component and optionally to allow searching for business process transaction data.
[Elastic stack documentation](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/)
[Fluentd documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/)
#### Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Service Sink
The Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Service Sink connector moves data from Apache Kafka® to Elasticsearch. It writes data from a topic in Kafka to an index in Elasticsearch. All data for a topic have the same type in Elasticsearch. This allows an independent evolution of schemas for data from different topics. This simplifies the schema evolution because Elasticsearch has one enforcement on mappings; that is, all fields with the same name in the same index must have the same mapping type.
#### S3 (MinIO)
FLOWX.AI uses [Min.IO](http://min.io/) as a cloud storage solution.
[MIN.IO documentation](https://min.io/)
[Docker available here](https://quay.io/repository/minio/minio?tab=tags\&tag=RELEASE.2022-05-26T05-48-41Z)
#### Oracle DB
Oracle Database is a relational database management system (RDBMS).
[Oracle DB documentation](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/)
#### Superset
Apache Superset is a business intelligence web application. It helps users to explore and visualize their data, from simple pie charts to detailed dashboards.
[Superset](https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro)
# Business filters
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/business-filters
An optional attribute, from the authorization token, that can be set in order to restrict access to process instances based on a business specific value (ex. bank branch name).
Using business filters we can make sure only the allowed users, with the same attribute, can access a [**process instance**](../../projects/runtime/active-process/process-instance).
In some cases it might be necessary to restrict access to process nodes based on certain [**business rules**](../../building-blocks/actions/business-rule-action/business-rule-action), for example only users from a specific bank branch can view the process instances started from that branch. This can be done by using business filters.
Before they can be used in the process definition the business filter attributes need to be set in the identity management platform. They have to be configured as a list of filters and should be made available on the authorization token. Application users will also have to be assigned this value.
When this filter needs to be applied, the process definition should include nodes with actions that will store the current business filter value to a custom `task.businessFilters` key on process parameters.
If this value is set in the process instance parameters, only users that have the correct business filter attribute will be able to interact with that process instance.
# Swimlanes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes
Swimlanes provide a way of grouping process nodes by process participants.
Using swimlanes we can make sure only certain user roles have access to certain process nodes.
In certain scenarios, it is necessary to restrict access to specific process [**nodes**](../../building-blocks/node/) based on user roles. This can be achieved by organizing nodes into different swimlanes.
Each swimlane can be configured to grant access only to users with specific roles defined in the chosen identity provider platform.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/multiple_swimlanes.png)
Depending on the type of node added within a swimlane, only users with the corresponding swimlane roles will have the ability to initiate process instances, view process instances, and perform actions on them.
[Scopes and roles for managing processes](../../../setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-access-roles-for-processes)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/swimlanes_permissions.gif)
When creating a new process definition, a default swimlane will automatically be added.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/swimlanes_default.gif)
As the token moves from one node to the next, it may transition between swimlanes. If a user interacting with the process instance no longer has access to the new swimlane, they will observe the process in read-only mode and will be unable to interact with it until the token returns to a swimlane they have access to.
Users will receive notifications when they can no longer interact with the process or when they can resume actions on it.

## **Changes**  🔧
<Info>
For clients upgrading from an older release (v3.x), we recommend consulting our [**Migrating from v3.x**](./migrating-from-v3.4.x/) guide for comprehensive migration instructions.
</Info>
Here's a summary of the changes introduced in version 4.0 after upgrading from v3.4.x for all microservices:
* **AuthToken Management**: The ui-sdk no longer relies on the authToken being stored in LOCAL\_STORAGE. Read more, [**here**](/4.0/sdks/angular-renderer#authorization).
* The **Subprocess Run** node is now called **Call activity** node.
* Business Rules: Enhancements for structured data management and improved attribute access via `instanceMetadata` new object. Read more, [**here**](./migrating-from-v3.4.x/process-configuration#business-rules).
* **Timer event scheduler**: Significant optimizations have been implemented in the timer event scheduler, resulting in improved efficiency and responsiveness.
* **UI Designer** updates and improvements.
* UI components style and props changes - consult the [**UI components change log**](./ui-components-changelog) for more information.
* Revised cache key organization. Read more [**here**](./migrating-from-v3.4.x/migrating-from-v3.4.x#revised-cache-key-organization).
* New environment variables to prevent log flooding. Read more, [**here**](./migrating-from-v3.4.x/migrating-from-v3.4.x#logging).
* Java 17 integration: Integrated Java 17 (all backend services - base image: `eclipse-temurin - 17.0.10_7-jre-jammy`) as default buildpack.
<Check>
Do not to forget to consult the [**migration guide**](./migrating-from-v3.4.x/) for more information.

### Admin - health monitoring
Improved health monitoring:
* Enabled role-based acccess control and added annotations to enable platform health by default.
* Established default annotations for platform health status.
* Adjusted liveness and readiness probes for improved reliability and responsiveness.
* Updated Prometheus scraping configuration for metric collection.
## **Bug Fixes** 🛠️
We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.
### Scheduler
* Tokens now leave the timer node promptly, no longer lingering like last-minute shoppers before closing time!
* Subprocesses can now rest easy knowing they won't trigger "Timer expression is not valid" errors when setting process expiry time in months—our code's time management just got a promotion!
### UI Designer
* Switch element label now obeys orders to move to the end—no more rebellious labels sticking to the start!
### Process Designer
* Small laptops users rejoice! Now you can scroll to see all subprocesses and audit logs without losing the last line—no more screen envy for external monitors!
* Start Subprocess Action now consistently saves selected version inputs and allows for multiple edits without page refreshes—no more need for extra clicks or browser gymnastics!
* Nodes now stay within swimlane borders when moved, preventing them from wandering off like lost sheep—no more unexpected node relocations disrupting your process layouts!
### FlowX Engine
* MVEL parser now (with the latest MVEL version update: 2.5.2) happily accepts arrays/lists after objects, eliminating JSON file frustrations and improving developer workflow—no more cryptic error messages ruining your day!
* Python Business Rules now reliably execute during runtime, ensuring consistent behavior between test and live modes—no more mysterious token standstills!
### Web SDK
* You can now seamlessly execute actions in processes with radio buttons and validators, even after page reloads—eliminating the frustration of encountering unresponsive buttons.
* Also you can now successfully execute UI Actions on image components without encountering "undefined token uuid" errors—no more frustrations with unresponsive image interactions!
* Custom validators now retain their specified async execution type upon saving, ensuring consistency and reliability in process validation—no more frustrating switches back to sync execution!
* Forget playing favorites in the WEB\_SDK! Now you can save data from both form elements and UI action custom body simultaneously. Say goodbye to tough decisions—saving data just got a whole lot easier and funnier!
### FlowX Admin
* Fixed issues with Persistent Database (PDB) API and service account auto-mount.
* Disabled auto service links in containers (all SVC/PORT variables).

## Gremlins to Watch Out For
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* Versioning: Merging branches without importing the latest committed version may result in a surprise merge conflict party. We're on it!
* UI Designer: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!

If you do not upgrade to the new configuration, make sure that in the actual configuration you will remove the protocol/schema, it is no longer needed: for example, instead of `http://localhost:9200` you will have `localhost:9200` as value.
</Info>
##### New configuration
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_PROTOCOL`: Default value is `https`; should be overridden if connection to Elasticsearch needs to be done over `http`.
Example:
```yaml
# New configuration with default value:
spring:
elasticsearch:
rest:
protocol: https / http # default value is https - should be overriden if connection to elastic needs to be done on http.
```
#### License core configuration
For the License core microservice you need to configure two different data sources: one for the engine database and one for the license database.
##### Old Engine database source
* `ENGINE_DATASOURCE_URL`
* `ENGINE_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL`
* `ENGINE_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
* `ENGINE_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
##### New Engine database source
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_ENGINE_URL: ${spring.datasource.jdbc-url}`: Pointing to old config for backwards compatibility.

# FlowX.AI 4.1.0 Release Notes (LTS)
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.1.0-may-2024/v4.1.0-may-2024
🎉 Welcome to the FlowX.AI 4.1.0 release!
<Info>
**Release Date:** 30th May 2024
</Info>
<Info>
This release is a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** version, ensuring extended support and stability.
</Info>
In this release, we've added some cool new features and enhancements to our already mind-blowing v4.0! Let's dive in and explore:
## **What's New?** 🆕
### Misconfigurations
The Misconfigurations Warnings feature introduces a proactive alert system that ensures alignment between process configurations and selected platforms.
With dynamic platform-specific settings, users receive alerts that guide them toward optimal configurations for navigation and UI design. These alerts, integrated into the frontend interface, empower users to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing the process configuration.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/misconfigurations.gif)
</Frame>
An additional step is required to compute and enable misconfigurations in existing processes from older releases:
<Card title="How to enable misconfigurations for existing processes?" href="./migrating-from-v3.4.x-to-v4.1#misconfigurations" icon="file" />
#### Generate for available platforms only
You can control which platforms you want to make available configurations for navigation areas, UI Designer or to enable/disable misconfigurations. Options include: web only, mobile, and omnichannel.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/proc_general_settings.png)
</Frame>
### Navigation areas - navigation inside zones and pages
We're enhancing navigation within zones and pages to enable a step-by-step or wizard-style experience.
In the Navigation Panel, a new option will be available exclusively for the web platform. Users can choose between "Single Page Form," which displays all tasks in the same zone (in parallel), and "Wizard," presenting tasks one at a time with custom navigation buttons.
<Frame>

</Frame>
Check the following section for more information:
<Card title="Navigation areas" href="../../4.1.x/docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas#zone" icon="link" />
### Static document management via CMS
Decoupled static document management from the Document Plugin, enabling independent management of documents such as terms and conditions, rules and regulations, and brochures.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/static_document_1.png)
</Frame>
The changes involve enhancing the platform's capabilities for managing static documents, particularly **PDFs**, within the **Media Library**. This includes enabling the upload of PDF files, updating information text to reflect PDF format specifications.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/static_document_2.png)
</Frame>
<Info>
PDF documents uploaded to the Media Library must adhere to a maximum file size limit of 10 MB. If you need to increase this limit for larger files, please refer to the following [**configuration options**](../../4.1.x/setup-guides/cms-setup#configuring-the-maximum-size-of-the-files).
</Info>
<Warning>
Please note that raising the file size limit may increase vulnerability to potential attacks. Consider carefully before making this change.
</Warning>
<Info>
With the introduction of the Media Library's static document management feature, the previous method of utilizing paths within the **Process Data** for **File Preview** component to display static documents will be phased out.
You can still use it if you have scenarios in which you need to [**generate templates from HTML**](../../4.1.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/documents-plugin/generating-from-html-templates) and then display them in a file preview.
</Info>
### Dismiss navigation on secondary token end
When a navigation sequence is initiated by a secondary token triggered by a boundary event, it will automatically be dismissed when the token reaches the stop process event. This feature ensures that informative modals are closed without requiring extra configurations.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/dismiss_token2nd.png)
</Frame>
### Theme Management
We've introduced preview options for more UI components. Now, you can review changes in the theming configurations before finalizing them.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/comp_previews.gif)
</Frame>
### UI Designer
We've added new properties, settings and styles across different UI components for an enhanced experience. Check the UI components - change log for the full list of improvements:
<Card title="UI components change log" href="./ui-components-changelog" icon="link" />
### Tracing - open telemetry
In our 4.1 release, we're thrilled to introduce tracing with Open Telemetry with additional FlowX custom span attributes, offering enhanced visibility and insights into application behavior. With its capabilities, users can pinpoint issues and optimize performance.
Consequently, we are phasing out Jaeger tracing to focus on the advanced features and broader support of Open Telemetry, ensuring a smooth transition.
For traces visualization, use tools like Grafana to filter and search spans based on custom attributes like `fx.processInstanceUuid`, `fx.nodeName`, `fx.actionName`, and others. This helps in pinpointing specific operations or issues within a trace.
Check the following section for more information and for more scenarios:
<Card title="Open Telemetry" href="../../4.1.x/docs/platform-deep-dive/integrations/open-telemetry" icon="file" />
**Additional configuration needed**! If you want to enable/configure Open Telemetry, check the following section:
<Card title="Open Telemetry configuration" href="../../4.1.x/setup-guides/open-telemetry-config" icon="page" />
For more information about the default Open Telemetry properties of FlowX.AI microservices, please refer to the following section:
<Card title="Open Telemetry default properties" href="../../4.1.x/setup-guides/ot-default-properties" icon="page" />
### Spring Boot upgrade (for BE Java services)
In the 4.1 release, we upgraded Spring Boot from version 2.5.4 to 3.2.x for all Java libraries and services. This update delivers significant performance enhancements and includes important bug fixes, thereby offering enhanced stability and functionality.
<Card title="Additional information" href="./migrating-from-v3.4.x-to-v4.1#spring-boot-upgrade" icon="link" />
## **Changes**  🔧
* **Process Designer**: The "Start Subprocess" functionality on Service Task nodes has been discontinued.
* **UI Designer**: Introduced `data test id` within the `Settings > Generic` tab across all UI components, facilitating seamless identification and interaction with UI elements during automated testing.
## **Bug Fixes** 🛠️
We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board.
* **Process Designer**: The error hiccups with embedded subprocesses and their error events have been smoothed out! No more getting stuck in a loop; now, you'll gracefully proceed to the embedded subprocess as expected.
* **Process Designer**: The versioning hiccup causing merge conflicts when trying to merge a branch with a main branch that wasn't imported into the environment has been fixed!
* **UI Designer**: The slider UI element's identity crisis has been resolved. No longer will it confuse its maximum value with its minimum counterpart.
* **UI Designer**: Concatenation glitch in text elements, where values from the collection prototype play hide and seek, has been patched up! No more disappearing acts - they'll be displayed side by side as intended.
* **UI Designer**: The glitch preventing the assignment of actions in button UI Actions with blank spaces in their names has been smoothed out!
## Gremlins to Watch Out For
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!

### Process instance data archiving
#### FlowX.AI configuration
New settings (new environment variables) have been added for process instance data partitioning and archiving. Check the following documentation sections for more details:

# Migrating from previous versions to v4.1.1
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.1.1-june-2024/migrating-from-previous-to-v4.1.1
If you are upgrading from a v3.4.x version, first check the following **migration guide** (to capture all the changes introduced in v4.0):
<Card title="Migrating from v3.4.x to v4.0" href="../v4.0.0-april-2024/migrating-from-v3.4.x/" icon="link" />
If you are upgrading from v4.0 to v4.1.1, do not forget to check the migration guides for the previous versions:
<Card title="Migrating from v4.0 to v4.1" href="../v4.1.0-may-2024/migrating-from-v3.4.x-to-v4.1" icon="link" />
If you are upgrading from v4.1 to v4.1.1, check the following migration guide:
## Migrating from v4.1 to v4.1.1
<Warning>
Before upgrading to v4.1.1, we recommend executing the initial data partitioning DB migrations manually. We recommend this no matter if you enable partitioning or not, as these DB migrations could take a lot of time.
After executing manually the SQL commands from Liquibase, all existing process instance related information will go into the initial partition.
</Warning>
<Info>
If partitioning is enabled, the initial partition will continue to be used until a new partition is generated according to the partitioning interval (DAY, WEEK, MONTH). Future partitions will be created automatically.
If partitioning is not enabled, all data will continue to be stored in this initial partition.

# FlowX.AI 4.1.1 Release Notes (LTS)
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.1.1-june-2024/v4.1.1-june-2024
<Info>
**Release Date:** 17th June 2024
</Info>
<Info>
This is a patch version part of the the long-term support for version 4.1.
</Info>
Welcome to FlowX.AI 4.1.1 release. Let's dive in and explore:
## **What's New?** 🆕
### FlowX.AI Engine: Process Instance Data Archiving
<Info>
Database Compatibility: Oracle and Postgres.
</Info>
We are introducing a new system for archiving data related to old process instances. This enables the implementation of data retention policies, with more predictable storage usage and costs.
<Tip>
Some operations involving process instance data can be snappier, given the lower amount of data in the system and new structure. Archiving relies on partitioning data based on the process instance start time. Each partition is associated with a time period (day, week, month), and retention is defined by the number of periods maintained in the system.
</Tip>
Archived data remains in new tables in the database, optionally compressed, and is no longer accessible in FlowX. These tables can be compressed, copied, moved, archived, or deleted without affecting other processes in FlowX.
For more details about process instance partitioning and archiving, including configuration of the feature, see:
<Card title="Process instance data archiving and partitioning" href="../../4.1.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/process-instance-data-archiving" />
## **Changes**  🔧
### Task Manager: base URL configuration
We have enhanced the Task Manager plugin by adding the ability to update the baseUrl for tasks. If the `task.baseUrl` is specified in the process parameters, it will now be sent to the Task Manager to update the tasks accordingly.
Example of a Business Rule:
```java
output.put("task", {"baseUrl": "https://your_base_url"});
```
This update streamlines the configuration process, ensuring that task URLs are dynamically updated and properly managed within the Task Manager.

## Gremlins to Watch Out For
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!

<Info>
This is a patch version part of the the long-term support for version 4.1.
</Info>
Welcome to FLowX.AI 4.1.2 release. Let’s dive in and explore:
## Enhancements ✨
### Web Renderer
* Improved PDF viewer locale setting based on renderer language configuration. Now, the PDF viewer menu will display localized content according to the chosen language setting, enhancing user experience.
## Bug fixes 🛠️
### FlowX.AI Engine
* **Fixed the Server-Sent Events (SSE) message issue** where they were playing hide-and-seek in the console. The problem stemmed from swimlanes lacking proper permissions and an overly strict event filter. After granting correct permissions and adjusting the filter, SSE messages are now reliably displayed.
* **Export Process/Copy & Paste**: Addressed an issue where soft-deleted UI actions were erroneously included in `GET /data` responses. Now, during export or copy-paste operations, only active UI actions are included, ensuring deleted actions remain hidden as intended.
## Gremlins to watch out for
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!

# FlowX.AI 4.1.3 Release Notes (LTS)
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.1.3-august-2024/v4.1.3-august-2024

Welcome to FLowX.AI 4.1.3 release. Let’s dive in and explore:
## Bug fixes 🛠️
### Process Designer
* **Copy/Paste Nodes**: Got a little too click-happy with those keyboard shortcuts in the Process Designer? You might have noticed multiple requests flooding in when you just wanted one. We’ve had a chat with the system, and it’s agreed to calm down. Now, one copy-paste equals one request. As it should be. ✂️📋
* **Stuck Nodes and Stubborn Swimlanes**: Tried to move a node or resize a swimlane after pasting and found everything frozen? The Process Designer had a little too much coffee. We’ve calmed it down, so now you can move and resize as you please. No more stuck nodes or swimlane stand-offs!
### FlowX.AI Engine
* **Business Rule Precision**: Occasionally, you might have encountered inconsistent outcomes when running the same business rule twice. This was due to a rare concurrency issue during rule compilation. We've addressed this by ensuring that, if an issue arises, the rule is recompiled rather than executing with an error. Now, your business rules run smoothly and consistently, just like you'd expect. 🎰🎯
## Gremlins to watch out for  👀
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **UI Designer**: When relocating UI elements between parents, the elements' order doesn't always get the memo, causing a mix-up in the family tree. We're untangling this knot!

# FlowX.AI 4.1.5 Release Notes (LTS)
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.1.5-september-2024/v4.1.5-september-2024
<Info>
**Release Date:** 23rd September 2024
</Info>
<Info>
This release is part of the long-term support (LTS) for version 4.1. While it’s a minor patch, we’ve focused on enhancing your security and overall experience with important fixes and updates.
</Info>
## Fixes 🛠️
* **UI templates - generic properties**: UI templates with generic properties (e.g., labels) were being overridden by platform-specific settings upon process start, causing unexpected changes. This override issue has been resolved—generic properties will now stay as configured.
* **Undo/redo (Windows)**: We’ve reminded the **Ctrl** key that it’s not the “Undo!” button, and it now behaves like a respectable key should. You can once again Copy, Paste, and Select All without your inputs mysteriously disappearing and reappearing.

# Deployment changes for v4.6.0
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.6.0-january-2025/migrating-from-v4.1.x-to-v4.6.0/migrating-from-v4.1.x
This document outlines the configuration and infrastructure changes introduced from v4.1.x to v4.6.0 for deploying the FlowX.AI platform.
## CMS Setup
### MongoDB configuration
In version 4.6.0, the CMS setup includes a more comprehensive MongoDB configuration, especially for runtime data handling:
* **Runtime MongoDB Instance**: A dedicated MongoDB instance for managing runtime data.
* **New Environment Variables**:
* `RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME`: Username for runtime MongoDB access.
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI`: Connection URI for the runtime MongoDB instance.
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE`: Specifies storage type for Azure environments (`mongodb` or `cosmosdb`). Default is `mongodb`.
* **Transaction Settings for Mongock Library**:
* `MONGOCK_TRANSACTIONENABLED`: Controls MongoDB transaction support with Mongock, defaulting to `false` due to compatibility concerns with MongoDB 5.
### Private storage configuration
Private CMS to securely store uploaded documents and AI-generated documents, ensuring they are accessible only via authenticated endpoints. This CMS will support AI services and workflows while maintaining strict access controls.
<Info>
Private CMS ensures secure file storage by keeping documents hidden from the Media Library and accessible only through authenticated endpoints with access token permissions. Files can be retrieved using tags (e.g., ai\_document, ref:UUID\_doc) and are excluded from project builds as they aren't needed at runtime.
</Info>
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_SERVER_URL`: This environment variable specifies the URL of the S3 server used for private file storage.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET_NAME`: This environment variable specifies the name of the S3 bucket dedicated to private file storage.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_CREATE_BUCKET`: This environment variable indicates whether the private S3 bucket should be created if it does not already exist. It can be set to true or false.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_ACCESS_KEY`: This environment variable holds the access key used to authenticate to the S3 server for private file storage.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY`: This environment variable holds the secret key used to authenticate to the S3 server for private file storage.
<Card title="CMS setup guide" href="../../../4.6.0/setup-guides/cms-setup" icon="file" />

* `DB_USERNAME`: Set to `data-model` for data model access.
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE`: Specifies storage type for Azure environments (`mongodb` or `cosmosdb`).
***
## Engine setup
### MongoDB configuration
The Engine configuration now includes additional setup for a runtime MongoDB instance to manage runtime builds:
* **Runtime MongoDB for Engine**:
* **New Environment Variables**:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI`: URI for connecting to the runtime MongoDB.
* `DB_USERNAME`: Set to `app-runtime` for runtime data access.
# Configuration and migration guide
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.6.0-january-2025/migrating-from-v4.1.x-to-v4.6.0/process-configuration
This guide outlines changes in process and UI configuration from v4.1.x to 4.6.0 version.
## Projects
The **Projects** feature in FlowX AI v4.6.0 is a new structure that organizes all dependencies and resources required for a project into a single deployable view. This enhancement simplifies configuration, deployment, and maintenance by layering projects on top of processes, offering a centralized workspace that encapsulates everything needed for project execution.
<Frame>
![FlowX.AI Designer](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/designer_new.png)
</Frame>
Several key configuration changes impact how resources and dependencies are managed, deployed, and maintained. This guide provides a breakdown of the configuration changes, automatic migration processes, and manual steps required to ensure a smooth transition.
<Frame>

</Frame>
***
### Consolidated resource management
* **Change**: All resources that were previously managed individually within processes are now grouped within Projects. This includes content management elements, integrations, themes, task configurations, and permissions.
* **Impact**: Resources like **enumerations**, **substitution tags**, and **generic parameters** are now managed within Projects, allowing centralized configuration and version control.
* **Migration**: All process-related resources will be migrated automatically into a **default project**, ensuring continuity of functionality in the new framework. After migration, you should verify that all critical resources are correctly configured within this default project.
<Card title="What are resources?" href="../../../4.6.0/docs/projects/resources" icon="page" />
### Enhanced version control and dependency management
* **Impact**: Projects support **dependency management** through **Libraries** and enforce version-controlled resources. Setting up a project now requires careful dependency management and versioning to prevent unintended updates.
* **Benefit**: Allows for modular, reusable resources and stable deployments across projects, reducing resource duplication and enhancing project compatibility.
### Migration checklist
To ensure a smooth transition, complete the following steps:
1. **Verify Process Migration**: Confirm that all existing process definitions have been correctly migrated into the default project.
2. **Set Configuration Parameter Overrides**: Post-deployment, adjust environment-specific Configuration Parameters in the default project.
3. **Update Task Views**: Replace the global "All Tasks" feature with project-specific Views in each project.
4. **Transfer Processes and Dependencies Manually**: If moving a process from the default project to another project, manually transfer associated resources and re-check dependencies.
***
## Generic parameters migration
* **Overview**: In version 4.6.0, global generic parameters (from versions prior to 4.6.0) have been migrated to project-level as Configuration Parameters, consolidating parameter management within specific projects for improved organization and control.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/Screenshot%202024-11-06%20at%2019.04.49.png)
</Frame>
* **Migration**: All generic parameters will be automatically migrated to Configuration Parameters section under a default project.
* **Business Rules Unaffected**: There is no impact on existing business rules; they will continue to function as before without requiring updates.
* **Process Export Considerations**: If you export a process from one project to another, ensure that you also transfer the associated configuration parameters. This step is crucial to maintain process functionality and consistency across projects.
* **Important Note**: Only values of generic parameters associated with the specific environment, or where `env = null` (displayed as "all" in the interface in versions prior to 4.6.0), will be migrated. You must ensure that you have correctly set the values for generic parameters, paying attention to environment values (which are case-sensitive), and export these generic parameters before migration to avoid any potential data loss.

</Frame>
* **Post-Deployment Step**: After the first deployment to an upper environment, you will need to create configuration parameter overrides with the specific values required for that environment. This ensures that all environment-specific configurations are accurately maintained and applied across different deployment stages.
<Tip>
To set configuration parameter overrides, navigate to **Your App -> Runtime -> Configuration Parameters Overrides**.

</Frame>
***
## Source systems migration
* **Change**: Source systems have not been migrated automatically and need to be manually recreated.
* **New Location**: In v4.6.0, source systems have been moved under Integration Designer.
* Manual Migration Required:
1. Navigate to Integration Designer.
2. Recreate each source system manually with the same code as in the original configuration.
3. Ensure the "Enable enumeration value mapping" checkbox is enabled.
* **Impact**: Failure to manually migrate source systems may result in broken integrations and missing data mappings.
**v4.6.0**:

***
## General
Before starting the migration, complete the following steps:
1. **Merge All Feature Branches**: Ensure all feature branches for processes are merged into the latest version on the main branch.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Resources**: Delete any test processes or resources that are no longer needed.
3. **Export Generic Parameters**: Export generic parameters as a backup to ensure they migrate accurately to project-specific Configuration Parameters.
### Migration steps
During migration, resources will be transferred into a single **default project** with one committed version.
* **Process Definitions**: Only the last committed process version on the main branch will migrate. If no committed version exists, the latest WIP version will be used.
* **Enumerations, Substitution Tags, and Task Manager**: These resources will be migrated to the default project.
* **Generic Parameters**: Migrated as **Configuration Parameters** within the default project, covering only values where `env = null` or that match the platform’s environment setting.
* **Languages**: Language settings (available languages and default) will be moved to project settings. Languages remain globally available.
### Resources excluded from migration
Some resources will remain globally available or are deprecated:
* **Themes**
* **Fonts**
* **Global Media Library** (for media used in themes)
* **Out of Office (Task Manager)**
* **Integration Management** (will not be available in v4.6.0)
***
## Datepicker Migration
In version 4.6.0, significant updates have been introduced to the **Datepicker** component to ensure compatibility with ISO 8601 date formats and enhanced handling of date attributes within the **Data Model**. This migration affects both newly created and existing processes.
### Key changes
1. **Introduction of Date Types**:
* **Standard Date**: Stores and displays date values in ISO 8601 format, respecting the project's locale and timezone settings.
* **Legacy Date**: Retains previous formatting to ensure compatibility with existing business rules and processes.
2. **Properties Updates**:
* The **Datepicker** now supports dependent properties such as `minDate`, `maxDate`, and `defaultValue`. These properties:
* Follow the formatting rules of the selected date type (Standard or Legacy).
* Ensure that dynamic date values pulled from the **Data Model** are displayed correctly.
3. **Backward Compatibility**:
* **Existing Processes**: All migrated processes with legacy Datepicker components will default to `Legacy Date` type. This preserves the original formatting and ensures no disruption in business rules or workflows.
* **New Processes**: Newly created processes will default to `Standard Date` type, saving values in ISO 8601 format.
***
### Migration process
1. **Legacy Datepickers**:
* Automatically flagged during migration.
* Continue to work with existing business rules.
* Require manual review for future updates to transition to the **Standard Date** format.
2. **Business Rules Updates**:
* Legacy Datepickers may require manual adjustments if associated business rules reference hardcoded date formats.
* Ensure that any dynamic dates used in business rules are compatible with the ISO 8601 standard.
3. **Standard Datepickers**:
* All new Datepicker components save date values directly in ISO 8601 format.
* Fully compatible with updated **Data Model** attributes, allowing seamless integration with external systems, adaptors, and reporting plugins.
### Considerations
* **Default Values**:
* For **Standard Datepickers**, the `defaultValue` must be in ISO 8601 format.
* Dynamic defaults can also be set using **Data Model** attributes or process data.
* **Data Model Integration**:
* All external and internal date attributes, including those used by adaptors or business rules, must be explicitly defined in the **Data Model**.
* **UI Designer Overrides**:
* Overrides can be applied to display dates differently for specific UI elements, ensuring flexibility for localized formatting.
### Recommendations for transition
* **Existing Processes**:
* Leave Datepicker components in `Legacy` mode unless business rules and workflows are updated to support ISO 8601.
* **New Processes**:
* Use `Standard Date` to ensure future compatibility and alignment with ISO 8601 formatting.
* **Documentation**:
* Review and update all timer expressions, adaptors, and external data feeds to use ISO 8601 format for consistency.
***
## Updates to expression evaluation
**What Changed:**
* A fix was implemented in the web expression evaluator regarding how string values are handled during process value replacement.
* Previously, when evaluating dynamic and computed expressions, string variables required manual insertion of double quotes (`""`) because the system did not automatically add them.
* With the recent fix, the system now **automatically adds the necessary quotes** for string replacements.
**Impact:**
* **Existing Expressions:** If your current dynamic or computed expressions include manually added quotes around string values, these might now result in redundant quotes or incorrect string formatting.
* **Behavioral Shift:** The automatic quote addition alters how string values are processed, which might affect outputs if the expressions were structured with the expectation of manual quotes.
**Action Required:**
1. **Review Your Expressions:** Check any dynamic and computed expressions in your processes that currently include manual double quotes around string values.
2. **Modify as Needed:** Remove unnecessary double quotes where the system now handles them automatically to prevent duplicate quoting or formatting issues.
***
## Export/import enumerations (CSV)
In the transition from version 4.1.x to 4.6.0, the following columns have been removed from the enum CSV export format:
* description.application
* description.draft
* contentValue.childContentDescription.application
* contentValue.childContentDescription.draft
* contentValue.childContentDescription.type
Existing CSV export/import processes should be updated to remove references to these columns to ensure compatibility with the 4.6.0 release.
***
## Post-migration recommendations
For complex projects with multiple use cases, **do not use the default project for ongoing development or production builds**. Instead:
1. **Create Branches within the Default Project**: Organize and streamline resources by creating branches. This enables a lightweight build focused on production.
2. **Split the Default Project into Smaller Projects**: Use the import/export feature to separate the default project into individual projects by use case.
* **Note**: When importing processes into a new project, resource references may need to be manually reconfigured.

# Renderer SDKs
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.6.0-january-2025/migrating-from-v4.1.x-to-v4.6.0/renderers
This guide assists in migrating from FlowX v4.1.x to v4.6.0.
## Android SDK migration guide
### Initialization config changes
A new configuration parameter named `locale` was added in order to improve formatting the dates, numbers and currencies.
When the SDK initialization happens through the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` method, the argument must be included inside the `config: SdkConfig` parameter value:
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(
...
config = SdkConfig(
baseUrl = "URL to FlowX backend",
imageBaseUrl = "URL to FlowX CMS Media Library",
enginePath = "some_path",
language = "en",
locale = Locale.getDefault(), // e.g. Locale("en", "US"), Locale("fr", "CA")
validators = mapOf("exact_25_in_length" to { it.length == 25 }),
enableLog = false,
),
...
)
```
### Changes when starting a Flowx process
Two new parameters were added:
| Name             | Description                                                                            | Type            | Requirement                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `projectId`      | The id of the project containing the process to be started                             | `String`        | Mandatory                        |
| `onProcessEnded` | Callback function where you can do additional processing when the started process ends | `(() -> Unit)?` | Optional. It defaults to `null`. |
```kotlin
fun startProcess(
projectId: String,
processName: String,
params: JSONObject = JSONObject(),
isModal: Boolean = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Unit)? = null,
closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```
### Changes when resuming a Flowx process
One new parameter was added:
| Name             | Description                                                                              | Type            | Requirement                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `onProcessEnded` | Callback function where you can do additional processing when the continued process ends | `(() -> Unit)?` | Optional. It defaults to `null`. |
```kotlin
fun continueProcess(
processUuid: String,
isModal: Boolean = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Unit)? = null,
closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```
### Changes regarding the implementation of Custom Components
The support for classical **[Android View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View)** system has been dropped.<br />
A Custom Component can now be implemented only by using the **[Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose)** UI system.
This means that the `CustomViewComponent` is now ignored in the internals of the SDK and has been marked as `@Deprecated`, in order to be completely removed in the next release.
<Info>
There is no immediate need to update any of the existing components.
</Info>
### Public API changes
The `changeLanguage` method has been updated and renamed to `changeLocaleSettings`, in order to accommodate the newly added `locale` config parameter:
```kotlin
fun changeLocaleSettings(locale: Locale, language: String)
```
### Library dependencies updates
* **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**: 1.9.22 **↗** **1.9.24**

## Angular SDK migration guide
### Upgrading to the new SDK libraries
The Angular SDK node packages have been updated and will use the latest versions Angular (version 19), thus all container apps that want to use the new SDKs should first update the Angular version of the container apps.
In the following we cover the migration guide for a container app from Angular v17 to v19 and the new SDKs.
<Steps>
<Step title="Remove old packages and their explicit dependencies (required dependency packages for new sdks are bundled in the libraries so we don't need)">
* remove `material-moment-adapter` unless its not used in custom components (usually together with material datepicker) and also the `moment` package (unless used elsewhere in the project )
```bash
npm uninstall @angular/material-moment-adapter
npm uninstall moment
```
* remove old FlowX SDK libraries:
```bash
npm uninstall @flowx/ui-sdk @flowx/ui-theme @flowx/ui-toolkit
```
* in `angular.json` remove references to old stylesheets:
```bash
"./node_modules/@flowx/ui-sdk/src/assets/scss/style.scss"
"./node_modules/paperflow-web-components/src/assets/scss"
"./node_modules/@flowx/ui-sdk/src/assets/scss"
```
* remove old FlowX SDKs explicit dependencies. Please check before removing that packages are not used in the container app or custom components.
```bash
npm uninstall date-fns event-source-polyfill inputmask ng2-pdfjs-viewer vanillajs-datepicker @ngneat/input-mask deepmerge-ts marked-mangle
```
* remove deprecated `Angular Flex` library (the new sdks don't use it anymore and the package has been deprecated by the Angular team) unless it is not used in container app or custom components
```bash
npm uninstall @angular/flex-layout
```
</Step>
<Step title="Update container app to Angular 18">
* Make sure to have the Angular CLI installed at version 18 (check with `ng --version`)
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@18
```
* Run the Angular update for version 18
```bash
ng update @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18
```
* Update Angular CDK or Angular Material
```bash
ng update @angular/cdk@18
```
or, if the container app uses Angular Material, run:
```bash
ng update @angular/material@18
```
* Optionally, if your project uses other angular packages (ex. `NgRx`) please run migrations to v18 for each of them before proceeding. You can find details on the libraries documentation pages.
* Angular has changed the default build path in the `dist` folder, it now uses a `browser` folder for the build output. In order to place the output of the build command directly in the `dist/[APP_NAME]` folder, add the following change in `angular.json`:
```json
{
...
"architect": {
...
"build": {
...
"options": {
...
"outputPath": {
"base": "dist/flowx-demo-app",
"browser": "" <-- add this line
},
}
}
}
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Update container app to Angular 19">
* Make sure to have the Angular CLI installed at version 19 (check with `ng --version`)
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@19
```
* Run the Angular update for version 19
```bash
ng update @angular/core@19 @angular/cli@19
```
* Update Angular CDK or Angular Material
```bash
ng update @angular/cdk@19
```
or, if the container app uses Angular material, run:
```bash
ng update @angular/material@19
```
* Optionally, if your project uses other Angular packages (ex. `NgRx`) please run migrations to v19 for each of them before proceeding. You can find details on the libraries documentation pages.
* Also, it is recommended that you update the `target` and `module` settings in the `tsconfig.json` file to the new version, although be advised that this might require additional changes in the codebase due to new compilation errors that might arise.
```json
{
...
"compilerOptions": {
...
"target": "ES2022",
"module": "ES2022"
}
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install the new FlowX SDK packages">
**Adding overrides for libraries that have a dependency on Angular version \< 19**
For some libraries, the required angular version might not be up to date or compatible with the new Angular version. In this case, you can add an override in the `package.json` file to force the library to use the new Angular version.
* For example, the `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` library has a dependency on Angular version 18 and will not work with the installed Angular version 19. To force the library to use the new Angular version, add the following override in the `package.json` file:
```json
{
...
"overrides": {
"ng2-pdfjs-viewer": {
"@angular/common": "^19.0.0",
"@angular/core": "^19.0.0",
"ng-packagr": "^19.0.0"
}
}
}
```
**Install new packages**:
<Warning>
**ACTION REQUIRED**: Update to the latest version 4.6 to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.
</Warning>
```bash
npm install @flowx/core-sdk@5.63.0 @flowx/core-theme@5.63.0 @flowx/angular-sdk@5.63.0 @flowx/angular-theme@5.63.0 @flowx/angular-ui-toolkit@5.62.1
```
* Install a type dependency for the SSE library:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/event-source-polyfill
```
* run through all the migration steps in the [New SDK Api changes](#new-sdk-api-changes) section below.
<Info>
Each migration requires a 'clean' repository state. Make sure to commit all changes before starting the next migration step.
</Info>
<Check>
After each Angular update it is recommended you restart your editor or TS Server, to use the new TS version since some import errors might appear.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
### New SDK API changes
#### Renderer SDK component usage
In the Angular SDK, the `<flx-process-renderer>` component has two new parameters have been introduced: `projectInfo` and `locale`. These additions help support localization and project-specific configurations.
| Name          | Description                                                                                     | Type                  | Requirement |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| `projectInfo` | Object containing an `projectId` key, which identifies the project of the process to be started | `{projectId: string}` | Mandatory   |
| `locale`      | Provides region-specific settings for localization.                                             | `string`              | Mandatory   |
Add the definitions for these properties in the class file of the component that uses the process renderer component:
```typescript
projectInfo = { projectId: 'your-project-id' },
locale = 'en-US',
```
Use these parameters in the template as inputs for the `<flx-process-renderer>` component:
```html
<flx-process-renderer
...
[projectInfo]="projectInfo"
[locale]="locale"
/>
```
#### API changes
Process Renderer:
| Category             | Old Approach                      | New Approach                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Process Renderer** | `FlxProcessModule.forRoot({...})` | `FlxProcessModule.withConfig({...})` |
#### Import path updates
| Category                   | Old Approach                                                                      | New Approach                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import Paths**           | `@flowx/ui-sdk`                                                                   | `@flowx/angular-sdk` (or, in some cases `@flowx/core-sdk`)                       |
|                            | `@flowx/ui-theme`                                                                 | `@flowx/angular-theme`                                                           |
|                            | `@flowx/ui-toolkit`                                                               | `@flowx/angular-ui-toolkit`                                                      |
| **Process Module**         | `import {FlxProcessModule} from '@flowx/ui-sdk';`                                 | `import {FlxProcessModule} from @flowx/angular-sdk`                              |
| **Localization Module**    | `import {FlxLocalizationModule} from '@flowx/ui-sdk';`  Include in module imports | `import {FlxLocalizePipe} from '@flowx/angular-sdk';` Remove from module imports |
| **Task Management**        | `import {FlxTaskManagementModule} from '@flowx/ui-sdk';`                          | `import {FlxTasksManagementComponent} from '@flowx/angular-sdk';`                |
| **Client Store Interface** | `import {ClientStoreInterface} from '@flowx/ui-sdk';`                             | `import {ClientStoreInterface} from '@flowx/core-sdk';`                          |
<Info>
You can also remove the `FlxLocalizationModule` from any `imports` arrays in modules, and import the `FlxLocalizePipe` instead
</Info>
### Icon module update
The `withExtraIconSet` method has been replaced with `provideExtraIconSet`, which should now be used in the providers array.
```typescript
@NgModule({
imports: [
IconModule,  // Import the IconModule
],
providers: [
// Use provideExtraIconSet to add your custom icon set
provideExtraIconSet({
customIcon1: 'path/to/custom-icon1.svg',
customIcon2: 'path/to/custom-icon2.svg',
// Add more icons as needed
})
]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
### Custom Interceptors
The new FlowX SDKs do not depend on Angular's `HttpClient` to make API calls, so existing interceptors must be adapted to a new format, for Request Interceptos (eg. custom headers) and Response Interceptors (eg. error handling)
For an overview of implementation details, please refer to the respective sections of the renderer documentation for the new API changes.

#### 🛠 Config vs Build Mode
**Config Mode**: Tinker, tweak, and perfect.
* Config mode is the environment where you set up, adjust, and manage your project's resources, processes, and configurations. It's the workspace where you fine-tune every aspect of the project before it's ready for deployment. Think of it as the design phase, where the focus is on setup, organization, and preparation.
**Build Mode**: Lock it, load it, deploy it.
* Build mode is the stage where the configurations you've set up are packaged into a deployable form. This is the runtime-ready version of your project, containing everything needed for it to function in a production environment. A build includes a snapshot of the project’s state at a given point, ensuring stability and predictability when deployed.

### Start new project instance action
We’ve introduced the Start New Project Instance node action, enabling users to initiate a completely new process from within an ongoing one. This functionality is perfect for scenarios where isolated use cases are managed across different projects or environments.

### Custom components validation
You are able to validate and retrieve data from a generated screen, including data from a custom form section. Additionally, you’ll have the ability to trigger and manage data directly within that section. This will be a major benefit for clients who have chosen to create custom components for the entire screen (for example, a form that isn’t supported natively by the platform).
<Card title="Validating elements" href="../../4.6.0/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/card#validating-elements" icon="file" />
***
### Autocomputed data to send
In previous platform versions, when creating your UI screens and working with data, you had to ensure that all the data stored in your process keys was saved in the process instance. This required adding an extra parameter called "Data to send" to the "Save Data" node action.
**Older versions** vs **v4.6.0**:
<Frame>
<Frame>
<img height="200" alt="older versions" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.x-aut.png" />

<img height="200" alt="v.4.6" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/4.2-aut.png" />
</Frame>
</Frame>
Now, with the autocompute feature, this step is no longer necessary, as the data is automatically saved and sent on your process instance.
<Tip>
You no longer need to add "Save Data" node actions, but make sure to include "Forms to Validate" on the UI Actions. This helps ensure that data is submitted correctly and automatically activates any added validators where they exist.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/post41/forms_to_validate.png)
</Frame>
</Tip>
However, you still have the option to customize which keys are included or excluded as needed.

</Frame>
<Info>
Values are saved in `params.analytics` via the PATCH `/actions` request.
</Info>
**Renderers updates**
Renderers now expose a public API for triggering analytics events:
* **Screen Events:** Triggered on user task display, using `flowxProps.analytics`.
* **Action Events:** Triggered on action execution, using `params.analytics`.
Dynamic values such as process store keys and replace tags are supported for more contextual tracking.
***
### Plugin updates
**Notifications** and **Documents** plugins have been integrated as **project resources**.
***
### Scheduled Processes: Timer management reimagined
We've completely redesigned how you manage timer-triggered processes. Before 4.6.0, timer activation was managed through a quick actions menu in process definition headers; now it's handled via dedicated UI section in the Runtime tab under Scheduled Processes.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/scheduled_processes.png)
</Frame>
🕒 Key Improvements:
* **Centralized Timer Management:** All process timers are now visible and manageable in one dedicated location
* **Persistent Settings:** Timer configurations persist across build exports/imports
* **Environment Control:** Activate or deactivate timers without redeploying your application

* **Improved Security for Hidden Fields**: Fixed a vulnerability where hidden fields could be accessed through browser developer tools.
* **Form Validation Reset on UI Dismissal**: Addressed an issue where form validation errors persisted after the UI was closed.
* **Keybinding Issues on Windows**: Fixed a bug where pressing specific keys triggered unintended operations in the designer.
* **Input Field Validation for Number Type**: Corrected the validation logic for number input fields to ensure consistent behavior.
* **Improved Datepicker Popup Positioning**: Resolved an issue where the datepicker popup overlapped the associated input field.
* **Manual Date Entry in Datepicker**: Fixed an issue where manually entering a date after selecting one from the datepicker caused errors.
* **Enhanced Update Mechanism for Custom Components**: Improved the reliability of updates for custom components to reflect changes consistently.
## Known issues 😢
We’re aware of a few quirks during merge conflicts and are working to fix them. Here’s a quick rundown:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Processes">
* After a merge, sequences without a connection to an end node may appear on the canvas in cases of conflicts related to deleted nodes in one of the versions. This may occur because the merge mechanism does not detect that a sequence needs to be deleted if, in the final version, the node remains deleted.
* Navigation areas – After a merge, inconsistencies in the navigation areas hierarchy calculated during merging may result in navigation areas being hidden in the final merged version.
* No merge conflict detected if a user task node is deleted in the source branch and its UI is modified in the destination branch.
* Nodes may end up having two different outgoing sequences in certain scenarios: When a node is not connected to another node, and both the source and target branches define different sequences to different nodes, the merged version may contain both sequences. In particular, this may cause inconsistencies for boundary nodes, which cannot have multiple outgoing sequences.
* Gateway nodes may lose some of their configurations during merging when conflicts arise.
* Conflicts arising from moving nodes to different swimlanes in both the source and target branches are not detected correctly and result in a merge error.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Enumerations">
* **Duplicate content values can be created during merging**: Merging branches with enumeration updates can result in duplicate content values or child enums with the same code. This occurs when identical names are added to the same enum in different branches, bypassing backend validation. Instead of flagging a conflict, the merge proceeds, creating duplicate entries. This issue disrupts the expected uniqueness constraint for enumeration values.
* **Enum content values might not save correctly in some cases**: In specific scenarios involving transformations of content values into child enums across branches, content values added in one branch may not appear after merging. Despite accepting changes from the branch where the content value was added, the merged version omits it, leading to incomplete or inconsistent enumeration data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflict Detection Gaps">
* **New substitution tags with the same name on different branches aren’t flagged**: Merging branches that include new substitution tags with identical names on different branches does not trigger a conflict. Instead, both tags are retained, resulting in duplicate substitution tags with the same name but different values. This issue bypasses expected conflict detection and can lead to inconsistencies in substitution tag usage.
* **Adding values to deleted data model keys does not raise conflicts**: When values are added to a data model key in one branch and the same key is deleted in another, merging does not generate a conflict. Instead, the added values from the first branch are silently lost in the merged version. This issue bypasses expected conflict detection, leading to data loss and inconsistencies in the resulting data model.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Media Library">
* Branches with media library assets sometimes fail to merge into the main branch: Merging branches with media library assets can result in a 500 Internal Server Error when changes to the same asset occur across multiple branches. This issue typically arises when one branch is merged into another, and then the combined branch is merged into the main branch. The failure occurs due to null parameter handling during the merge process, preventing the merge from completing successfully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Notification and document templates">
* Branches with notification and document templates fail to merge into the main branch
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI/UX">
* After a successful merge, the merged version is not selected in the versioning modal.
* Some entries in the merge conflicts tree may show numbers instead of specific identifiers (e.g. forms);
* **Unnecessary scrollbars appear in the merge modal for single items**: The merge conflict modal displays unnecessary scrollbars when only a single item is present in the list. This occurs in scenarios where media library assets with long keys are involved, creating a layout issue that affects the user interface. While functionality is not impacted, this visual inconsistency can reduce the overall user experience during conflict resolution.
* **Fields like `originalCreationTimestamp` and `flowxUuid` are incorrectly flagged as conflicts**: The merge conflict modal displays unnecessary scrollbars when only a single item is present in the list. This occurs in scenarios where media library assets with long keys are involved, creating a layout issue that affects the user interface. While functionality is not impacted, this visual inconsistency can reduce the overall user experience during conflict resolution.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## Changes 🔧
* **Web Renderer Caching:** Improved resource caching with browser mechanisms keyed to build IDs.
* **Process Designer:** Enhanced drag-and-drop functionality for node placement.

# FlowX.AI 4.6.1 Release Notes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.6.1-february-2025/v4.6.1-february-2025
FlowX.AI 4.6.1 is here with important fixes and improvements to keep things running smoothly. No new features this time—just focused updates to improve stability, fix bugs, and enhance overall performance. Simple, clean, and efficient.
## **What's new?** 🆕
### Rendering
**Form Elements** improvements:
* **Default Value Handling**: Defaults are applied only when no existing value is found, and set upon first display (with specific exceptions).
* **Data Consistency**: Form elements now save data in standardized formats based on type for improved reliability.
* **Smart Defaults**: Clear fallback behaviors for elements like switches, sliders, and checkboxes when no value is present.
* **Synchronized Inputs**: Linked form elements (e.g., input + slider) stay in sync with automatic value adjustments within set limits.
* **Dynamic Dependencies**: Form elements can dynamically adjust based on related components’ values for greater flexibility.
### Merge conflicts
* Improvement: merged version is now selected after a successful merge in versioning modal.
## Bug fixes 🐞
### Merge conflicts
* Fixed an issue that caused conflicts involving notification and document templates to fail.
* Fixed an issue where merges failed when a deleted configuration parameter was updated on a branch.
* Fixed an issue that resulted in duplicate substitution tag keys appearing in the merged version.
* Fixed an issue where merges failed due to the same dependency being added to both the source and target branches.
* Fixed issues related to workflow conflicts.
### Rendering
* Fixed an issue where documents from the media library were not loading correctly when added as a file preview in a user task.
### Integration Designer
* Fixed issue causing a 400 error when adding an enum mapper to the body tab due to incorrect data validation.
* Fixed issue where the last attribute in the objects table was not visible at higher zoom levels due to UI rendering constraints.
## Known issues 😢
We’re aware of a few quirks during merge conflicts and are working to fix them. Here’s a quick rundown:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Processes">
* After a merge, sequences without a connection to an end node may appear on the canvas in cases of conflicts related to deleted nodes in one of the versions. This may occur because the merge mechanism does not detect that a sequence needs to be deleted if, in the final version, the node remains deleted.
* Navigation areas – After a merge, inconsistencies in the navigation areas hierarchy calculated during merging may result in navigation areas being hidden in the final merged version.
* No merge conflict detected if a user task node is deleted in the source branch and its UI is modified in the destination branch.
* Nodes may end up having two different outgoing sequences in certain scenarios: When a node is not connected to another node, and both the source and target branches define different sequences to different nodes, the merged version may contain both sequences. In particular, this may cause inconsistencies for boundary nodes, which cannot have multiple outgoing sequences.
* Gateway nodes may lose some of their configurations during merging when conflicts arise.
* Conflicts arising from moving nodes to different swimlanes in both the source and target branches are not detected correctly and result in a merge error.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Enumerations">
* **Duplicate content values can be created during merging**: Merging branches with enumeration updates can result in duplicate content values or child enums with the same code. This occurs when identical names are added to the same enum in different branches, bypassing backend validation. Instead of flagging a conflict, the merge proceeds, creating duplicate entries. This issue disrupts the expected uniqueness constraint for enumeration values.
* **Enum content values might not save correctly in some cases**: In specific scenarios involving transformations of content values into child enums across branches, content values added in one branch may not appear after merging. Despite accepting changes from the branch where the content value was added, the merged version omits it, leading to incomplete or inconsistent enumeration data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflict Detection Gaps">
* **Adding values to deleted data model keys does not raise conflicts**: When values are added to a data model key in one branch and the same key is deleted in another, merging does not generate a conflict. Instead, the added values from the first branch are silently lost in the merged version. This issue bypasses expected conflict detection, leading to data loss and inconsistencies in the resulting data model.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Media Library">
* Branches with media library assets sometimes fail to merge into the main branch: Merging branches with media library assets can result in a 500 Internal Server Error when changes to the same asset occur across multiple branches. This issue typically arises when one branch is merged into another, and then the combined branch is merged into the main branch. The failure occurs due to null parameter handling during the merge process, preventing the merge from completing successfully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI/UX">
* After a successful merge, the merged version is not selected in the versioning modal.
* Some entries in the merge conflicts tree may show numbers instead of specific identifiers (e.g. forms);
* **Unnecessary scrollbars appear in the merge modal for single items**: The merge conflict modal displays unnecessary scrollbars when only a single item is present in the list. This occurs in scenarios where media library assets with long keys are involved, creating a layout issue that affects the user interface. While functionality is not impacted, this visual inconsistency can reduce the overall user experience during conflict resolution.
* **Fields like `originalCreationTimestamp` and `flowxUuid` are incorrectly flagged as conflicts**: The merge conflict modal displays unnecessary scrollbars when only a single item is present in the list. This occurs in scenarios where media library assets with long keys are involved, creating a layout issue that affects the user interface. While functionality is not impacted, this visual inconsistency can reduce the overall user experience during conflict resolution.

* **Replace** (overwrite the existing resource)
* **Use destination** (retain the existing resource without copying)
</Tab>
<Tab title="Why it’s better">
* **No broken references** – Everything stays connected.
* **Auto-add missing dependencies** – No manual setup required.
* **Works with WIP & committed versions (only from committed to WIP)** – Flexibility for your workflow.

### Duplicate resources
<Tabs>
<Tab title="What you can duplicate">
The **Duplicate Resource** feature lets users create a copy of an existing resource within the same project or library version, streamlining workflows and ensuring quick reusability.
<Frame>
<video controls className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/duplicate_resources.mp4" />
</Frame>
You can duplicate the following resources:
* **Processes**
* **Enumerations**
* **Media files (including Global media library files)**
* **Notification templates**
* **Document templates**
* **Views**
</Tab>
<Tab title="How it works">
* **Duplicate options** are available from each resource’s three-dot menu (table row & secondary navigation).
* When selected, a **"Duplicate" modal** opens with a prefilled name: *Copy of \[Resource Name]* (which can be edited).
* **Cancel** to discard changes or **Duplicate** to create an exact copy in the same project/library version.
* **Success confirmation:** The system navigates to the newly created resource and displays a success message.
* **Error handling:** If a resource with the same name/key exists, users will be prompted to rename it before proceeding.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Why it’s useful">
💡 **Use cases:**
* Quickly iterate on existing resources.
* Reduce redundant manual setup.
* Maintain consistency within projects.
* Easily clone complex configurations for testing and modifications.

### Configuration parameters overrides
🔹 **Libraries can now define configuration parameters** to help test processes or workflows that use those parameters.
🔹 However, **libraries do not support overrides**.
* **Overrides for library config parameters must be done within a project** where the library is added as a dependency.
* **Overrides cannot be added in libraries directly.**
<Frame>
<video controls className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.6/lib_ov.mp4" />
</Frame>
💡 **What this means:**
* Libraries provide **default values** for configuration parameters.
* Projects using those libraries **can override these values** as needed.
* This ensures **clear separation between library defaults and project-specific configurations** while maintaining flexibility.
<Tip>
✨ **Overrides take precedence** over library values—so you stay in control.

## SDK changes
### Expose Enumerations API in Angular SDK
Developers can now dynamically retrieve enumerations via the Angular SDK, making it easier to use enums in custom components like dropdowns.
<Tip>
How it Works?
A new method in the Angular SDK allows direct access to enumerations, reducing manual imports and improving flexibility.
</Tip>
**Usage**
The `getEnumeration()` function returns key-value pairs that can be used in components that need enumeration data:
```typescript
getEnumeration(enumName: string): { value: string; label: string }[]
```
* `enumName` (string) – The name of the enumeration to retrieve (e.g., 'UserRoles', 'cities')
* Returns: An array of objects containing value-label pairs representing the requested enumeration
<Accordion title="Example usage">
The enumeration service works seamlessly with Angular's resource API for reactive state management:
```typescript
import { Component, effect, model, resource } from '@angular/core';
import { getEnumeration } from '@flowx/angular-sdk';
@Component({
selector: 'app-dynamic-enum-select',
template: `
<select>
@for (option of options.value(); track option.value) {
<option [value]="option.value">{{ option.label }}</option>
}
</select>
<button (click)="enumName.set('cities')">Load Cities</button>
<button (click)="enumName.set('countries')">Load Countries</button>
`
})
export class DynamicEnumSelectComponent {
// Create a signal to track the currently selected enum
enumName = model<string>('UserRoles');
// Use resource API to reactively load enumerations when enumName changes
options = resource({
request: this.enumName,
loader: ({ request: enumName }) => getEnumeration(enumName),
});
constructor() {
effect(() => {
if (this.options.isLoading()) {
console.log(`Loading enumeration: ${this.enumName()}`);
} else {
console.log(`Loaded enumeration: ${this.enumName()}`, this.options.value());
}
});
}
}
```
</Accordion>

## Changes
### Dynamic kafka topics
FlowX 4.7.0 introduces **Dynamic Kafka Topics**, enabling more flexible and configurable messaging across processes.
🔹 **What’s new?**
* Use **Configuration Parameters** to dynamically assign Kafka topics in **Kafka Send** and **Kafka Receive** actions.
* Concatenate predefined parameters with process variables for **on-the-fly topic selection**.
* Reduce hardcoded values and **simplify environment-specific configurations**.
💡 **Why it matters:**
* Makes **Kafka integrations more scalable** across different deployments.
* Supports **multi-topic messaging** for different use cases without manual updates.
* Ensures better **reusability and maintainability** in process configurations.
📌 Check the [Kafka Send Action](../../4.7.0/docs/building-blocks/actions/kafka-send-action#dynamic-kafka-topics) section for setup details.
***
### Export/import compatibility
In version 4.7, the import-export functionality for application-version is no longer backward compatible.
* Zip files exported from version 4.7 cannot be imported into earlier FlowX versions.
* Similarly, zip files from earlier versions cannot be imported into 4.7.
<Info>
Zip files for builds and specific resources remain unaffected.

Python scripts now run at least 3 times faster than with Python 2.7.
</Card>
<Card title="Modern Python Features" icon="code">
Take advantage of Python 3's improved syntax, libraries, and security features.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
<Info>
**Important Configuration Note:** Python 2.7 remains the default runtime. To enable Python 3 support with its performance improvements, you must set the feature toggle `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM` to `true` in the [**Process Engine configuration**](/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup) and in the **AI Developer** (if used) agent configuration. If this configuration variable is missing or set to `false`, Python 2.7 will be used.
</Info>
More details about the scripting capabilities can be found in the [Supported scripting languages](../../4.7.x/docs/building-blocks/supported-scripts) section.
***
## Performance improvements 🚀
We've made significant performance enhancements throughout the platform to make your development and runtime experience smoother and faster.
### Design time improvements
For large processes, you'll notice dramatic improvements:
| Operation         | Improvement    |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Cloning a process | **5x faster**  |
| Opening a process | **70x faster** |
### Runtime enhancements
Platform average response time has been **reduced by 20%** in our comprehensive benchmark\*.
<Info>
\*The benchmark simulates a typical business process with a combination of user and service tasks. It includes rules that automate decision-making, as well as events for time-sensitive actions and communication. The process also covers various system functions, ensuring the platform can efficiently manage complex workflows with both individual and parallel tasks.
</Info>

## Security enhancements 🔒
We've significantly improved platform security by implementing proper endpoint access controls and separation between internal and public-facing APIs.
<CardGroup columns="2">
<Card title="Enhanced API Security" icon="shield-check">
Runtime execution proxy vulnerability addressed with comprehensive endpoint updates.
</Card>
<Card title="Access Control Improvements" icon="lock">
Better separation between design-time and runtime endpoints with proper access controls.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
### Endpoint security updates
We've implemented a comprehensive security update for runtime endpoints to prevent potential proxy vulnerabilities:
* Redesigned API structure to separate internal (`runtime-internal`) from external-facing (`runtime`) endpoints
* Migrated design-time operations to use `runtime-internal` endpoints for enhanced security
* Moved specific management operations to dedicated `build-mgmt` endpoints
* Updated all API clients to use the new secure endpoints
<Info>
**Important:** Make sure to update to the corresponding  version of the [**`flowx-admin`**](./deployment-guidelines-v4.7.1#component-versions) to benefit from these security enhancements.

initFlowXSdk()
}
private fun initFlowXSdk() {
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(
context = applicationContext,
config = SdkConfig(
baseUrl = "URL to FlowX backend",
imageBaseUrl = "URL to FlowX CMS Media Library",

// Send a broadcast message to notify the Activity currently displaying the running process.
// The Activity should handle the broadcast to reload and display the newly started process identified by `processInstanceUuid`.
}
)
}
}
```
The configuration properties that should be passed as `SdkConfig` data for the `config` parameter above are:
| Name           | Description                                                         | Type                                | Requirement                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `baseUrl`      | URL to connect to the FlowX back-end environment                    | `String`                            | Mandatory                                   |
| `imageBaseUrl` | URL to connect to the FlowX Media Library module of the CMS         | `String`                            | Mandatory                                   |
| `enginePath`   | URL path segment used to identify the process engine service        | `String`                            | Mandatory                                   |
| `language`     | The language used for retrieving enumerations and substitution tags | `String`                            | Optional. Defaults to `en`.                 |
| `locale`       | The locale used for date, number and currency formatting            | `java.util.Locale`                  | Optional. Defaults to `Locale.getDefault()` |
| `validators`   | Custom validators for form elements                                 | `Map<String, (String) -> Boolean>?` | Optional.                                   |
| `enableLog`    | Flag indicating if logs should be printed                           | `Boolean`                           | Optional. Defaults to `false`               |
#### Custom validators
The `custom validators` map is a collection of lambda functions, referenced by *name* (i.e. the value of the `key` in this map), each returning a `Boolean` based on the `String` which needs to be validated.
For a custom validator to be evaluated for a form field, its *name* must be specified in the form field process definition.
<Tip>
By looking at the example from above:
```kotlin
mapOf("exact_25_in_length" to { it.length == 25 })
```
if a form element should be validated using this lambda function, a custom validator named `"exact_25_in_length"` should be specified in the process definition.
</Tip>
## Using the library
### Authentication
To be able to use the SDK, **authentication is required**. Therefore, before calling any other method on the singleton instance, make sure that the access token provider is set by calling:
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().setAccessTokenProvider(accessTokenProvider = { "your access token" })
```
The lambda passed in as parameter has the `ai.flowx.android.sdk.FlowxSdkApi.Companion.AccessTokenProvider` type, which is actually a functional interface defined like this:
```kotlin
fun interface AccessTokenProvider {
fun get(): String
}
```
<Tip>Whenever the access token changes based on your own authentication logic, it must be updated in the renderer by calling the `setAccessTokenProvider` method again.</Tip>
### Theming
<Warning>Prior setting up the theme, make sure the `access token provider` was set.<br />Check the [authentication](#authentication) section for details.</Warning>
To be able to use styled components while rendering a process, the theming mechanism must be invoked by calling the `suspend`-ing `setupTheme(...)` method over the singleton instance of the SDK:
```kotlin
suspend fun setupTheme(
themeUuid: String,
fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath: String? = null,
@MainThread onCompletion: () -> Unit
)
```
#### Parameters
| Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Type         | Requirement                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `themeUuid`                       | UUID string of the theme configured in FlowX Designer                                                                                                        | `String`     | Mandatory. Can be empty      |
| `fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath` | Android asset relative path to the corresponding JSON file to be used as fallback, in case fetching the theme fails and there is no cached version available | `String?`    | Optional. Defaults to `null` |
| `onCompletion`                    | `@MainThread` invoked closure, called when setting up the theme completes                                                                                    | `() -> Unit` | Mandatory                    |
<Note>
If the `themeUuid` parameter value is empty (`""`), no theme will be fetched, and the mechanism will rely only on the fallback file, if set.<br /><br />
If the `fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath` parameter value is `null`, there will be no fallback mechanism set in place, meaning if fetching the theme fails, the redered process will have no style applied over it's displayed components.
</Note>
<Note>
The SDK caches the fetched themes, so if a theme fetch fails, a cached version will be used, if available. Otherwise, it will use the file given as fallback.
</Note>
#### Sample
```kotlin
viewModelScope.launch {
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().setupTheme(
themeUuid = "some uuid string",
fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath = "theme/a_fallback_theme.json",
) {
// theme setup complete
// do specific logic
}
}
```
<Tip>
The `fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath` always search for files under your project's `assets/` directory, meaning the example parameter value is translated to `file://android_asset/theme/a_fallback_theme.json` before being evaluated.
</Tip>
<Warning>Do not [start](#start-a-flowx-process) or [resume](#resume-a-flowx-process) a process before the completion of the theme setup mechanism.</Warning>
### Changing current locale settings
The current `locale` and `language` can be also changed after the [initial setup](#configuring-the-library), by calling the `changeLocaleSettings` function:
```kotlin
fun changeLocaleSettings(locale: Locale, language: String)
```
#### Parameters
| Name       | Description                   | Type               | Requirement |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `locale`   | The new locale                | `java.util.Locale` | Mandatory   |
| `language` | The code for the new language | `String`           | Mandatory   |
<Warning>
**Do not change the locale or the language while a process is rendered.**<br />
The change is successful only if made before [starting](#start-a-flowx-process) or [resuming](#resume-a-flowx-process) a process.
</Warning>
#### Sample
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().changeLocaleSettings(locale = Locale("en", "US"), language = "en")
```

This wrapper activity must display only the `@Composable` returned from the SDK (i.e. it occupies the whole activity screen space).
</Tip>
#### Sample
```kotlin
class ProcessActivity : ComponentActivity() {
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
...
setContent {
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().startProcess(
projectId = "your project id",
processName = "your process name",
params: JSONObject = JSONObject(),
isModal = true,
onProcessEnded = {
// NOTE: possible processing could involve doing something in the container app (i.e. navigating to a different screen)
},
closeModalFunc = { processName ->
// NOTE: possible handling could involve doing something differently based on the `processName` value
},
).invoke()
}
}
...
}
```
### Resume a FlowX process
<Warning>Prior resuming process, make sure the [authentication](#authentication) and [theming](#theming) were correctly set up</Warning>
To resume an existing instance of a FlowX process, after fulfilling all the prerequisites, use the `continueProcess` function:
```kotlin
fun continueProcess(
processUuid: String,
isModal: Boolean = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Unit)? = null,
closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```

This wrapper activity must display only the `@Composable` returned from the SDK (i.e. it occupies the whole activity screen space).
</Tip>
#### Sample
```kotlin
class ProcessActivity : ComponentActivity() {
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {

// NOTE: possible processing could involve doing something in the container app (i.e. navigating to a different screen)
},
closeModalFunc = { processName ->
// NOTE: possible handling could involve doing something differently based on the `processName` value
},
).invoke()
}
}
...
}
```
## Custom components
The container application should decide which custom component view to provide using the `componentIdentifier` configured in the UI designer.
A custom component receives `data` to populate the view and `actions` available to execute, as described below.<br />
It can also be validated and provide data back into the process when executing an action.
To handle custom components, an *implementation* of the `CustomComponentsProvider` interface should be passed as a parameter when initializing the SDK:
```kotlin
interface CustomComponentsProvider {
fun provideCustomComposableComponent(): CustomComposableComponent?
}
```
#### Sample
```kotlin
class CustomComponentsProviderImpl : CustomComponentsProvider {
override fun provideCustomComposableComponent(): CustomComposableComponent? {
return object : CustomComposableComponent {...}
}
}
```
### CustomComposableComponent
The implementation for providing a custom component is based on creating and binding a user defined [@Composable](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Composable) function, through the `CustomComposable` interface:
```kotlin
interface CustomComposableComponent {
fun provideCustomComposable(componentIdentifier: String): CustomComposable
}
```
The returned `CustomComposable` object is an interface defined like this:
```kotlin
interface CustomComposable {
@Deprecated(message = "Will be removed in future releases")
val isDefined: Boolean // always MUST return `true`
// `@Composable` definitions for the custom components that can be handled
val composable: @Composable () -> Unit
/**
* Called when the data is available for the custom component
* (i.e. when the User Task that contains the custom component is displayed)
*
* @param data used to populate the custom component
*/
fun populateUi(data: Any?)
/**
* Called when the actions are available for the custom component
* (i.e. when the User Task that contains the custom component is displayed)
*
* @param actions that need to be attached to the custom component (e.g. onClick events)
*/
fun populateUi(actions: Map<String, CustomComponentAction>)
/**
* This will be called when executing an action from a FlowX.AI UI Component, when the platform needs to know if the specified/marked components are valid.
* Defaults to `true`.
*/
fun validate(): Boolean = true
/**
* This will be called when executing an action from a FlowX.AI UI Component, on computing the data to be sent as body on the network request.
* Returning `null` (i.e. default) means it does not contribute with any data to be sent.
*/
fun saveData(): JSONObject? = null
}
```
<Tip>
The value for the `data` parameter received in the `populateUi(data: Any?)` could be:<br />
* `Boolean`
* `String`
* `java.lang.Number`
* `org.json.JSONObject`
* `org.json.JSONArray`
The appropriate way to check and cast the data accordingly to the needs must belong to the implementation details of the custom component.
</Tip>
<Tip>
Both validation and providing data back into process are optional, and, based on the needs, it may be included in the implementation or not.
</Tip>
#### Sample
Among multiple existing custom components, there may be one that:
* allows the input of a value representing an `age`
* the value should be validated (e.g. to be at least 35 years old)
* the value will be passed back into the process

override fun saveData(): JSONObject? = null
}
}
```
### Execute action
The custom components which the container app provides may contain FlowX actions available for execution.<br /><br />
These actions are received through the `actions` parameter of the `populateUi(actions: Map<String, CustomComponentAction>)` method.<br /><br />
In order to run an action (i.e. on a click of a button in the custom component) you need to call the `executeAction` method:
```kotlin
fun executeAction(action: CustomComponentAction, params: JSONObject? = null)
```
#### Parameters
| Name     | Description                                                                 | Type                                                          | Requirement                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `action` | Action object extracted from the `actions` received in the custom component | `ai.flowx.android.sdk.component.custom.CustomComponentAction` | Mandatory                       |
| `params` | Parameters needed to execute the `action`                                   | `JSONObject?`                                                 | Optional. It defaults to `null` |
### Get a substitution tag value by key
```kotlin
fun replaceSubstitutionTag(key: String): String
```
All substitution tags will be retrieved by the SDK before starting the process and will be stored in memory.
Whenever the container app needs a substitution tag value for populating the UI of the custom components, it can request the substitution tag using the method above, by providing the `key`.
It returns:
* the key's counterpart, if the `key` is valid and found
* the empty string, if the `key` is valid, but not found
* the unaltered string, if the key has the wrong format (i.e. not starting with `@@`)
### Get a media item url by key
```kotlin
fun getMediaResourceUrl(key: String): String?
```
All media items will be retrieved by the SDK before starting the process and will be stored in memory.
Whenever the container app needs a media item url for populating the UI of the custom components, it can request the url using the method above, by providing the `key`.
It returns the `URL` string of the media resource, or `null`, if not found.
## Custom header view for the [STEPPER](../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas#stepper) component
The container application can opt for providing a custom view in order to be used, for all the [Stepper](../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas#stepper) components, as a replacement for the built-in header.<br />
The custom view receives `data` to populate its UI, as described below.
To provide a custom header for the [Stepper](../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas#stepper), an *implementation* of the `CustomStepperHeaderProvider` interface should be passed as a parameter when initializing the SDK:
```kotlin
interface CustomStepperHeaderProvider {
fun provideCustomComposableStepperHeader(): CustomComposableStepperHeader?
}
```
#### Sample
```kotlin
class CustomStepperHeaderProviderImpl : CustomStepperHeaderProvider {
override fun provideCustomComposableStepperHeader(): CustomComposableStepperHeader? {
return object : CustomComposableStepperHeader {...}
}
}
```
### CustomComposableStepperHeader
To provide the custom header view as a [@Composable](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Composable) function, you have to implement the `CustomComposableStepperHeader` interface:
```kotlin
interface CustomComposableStepperHeader {
fun provideComposableStepperHeader(): ComposableStepperHeader
}
```
The returned `ComposableStepperHeader` object is an interface defined like this:
```kotlin
interface ComposableStepperHeader {
/**
* `@Composable` definition for the custom header view
* The received argument contains the stepper header necessary data to render the view.
*/
val composable: @Composable (data: CustomStepperHeaderData) -> Unit
}
```
The value for the `data` parameter received as function argument is an interface defined like this:<br />
```kotlin
interface CustomStepperHeaderData {
// title for the current step; can be empty or null
val stepTitle: String?
// title for the current selected substep; optional;
// can be empty ("") if not defined or `null` if currently there is no selected substep
val substepTitle: String?
// 1-based index of the current step
val step: Int
// total number of steps
val totalSteps: Int
// 1-based index of the current substep; can be `null` when there are no defined substeps
val substep: Int?
// total number of substeps in the current step; can be `null` or `0`
val totalSubsteps: Int?
}
```
#### Sample
```kotlin
override fun provideComposableStepperHeader(): ComposableStepperHeader? {
return object : ComposableStepperHeader {
override val composable: @Composable (data: CustomStepperHeaderData) -> Unit
get() = @Composable { data ->
/* add some @Composable implementation which displays `data` */
}
}
}
```
## Collecting analytics events
To be able to collect analytics events from the SDK, an implementation for the `AnalyticsCollector` functional interface may be provided when initializing the SDK:
```kotlin
fun interface AnalyticsCollector {
fun onEvent(event: Event)
}
```
where the `Event` looks like this:
```kotlin
interface Event {
val type: String
val value: String
}
```
#### Sample
The implementation can be passed as a lambda, like:
```kotlin
analyticsCollector = { event ->
// do whatever is needed (e.g. log the event)
Log.i("Analytics", "Event(type = ${event.type}, value = ${event.value})")
}
```
## Handling "Start of a new process"
When an action of type `START_PROJECT` is executed, the `onNewProcessStarted` lambda provided in the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` function is invoked.
This callback provides the UUID of the newly started process, which can be used to resume the process by calling the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().continueProcess(...)` method.
It is the responsibility of the container application's developer to implement the necessary logic for displaying the appropriate UI for the newly started process.
#### Sample
One way to handle this is to send a broadcast message to notify the Activity currently displaying the running process.
The Activity should handle the broadcast to reload and display the newly started process identified by `processInstanceUuid` (received in the broadcast intent).
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(
...
onNewProcessStarted = { processInstanceUuid ->
applicationContext.sendBroadcast(
Intent("some.intent.filter.indentifier").apply {
putExtra("processInstanceUuid", processInstanceUuid)
setPackage("your.application.package")
}
)
}
...
)
class ProcessActivity : ComponentActivity() {
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
...
setContent {
val yourBroadcastReceiver = remember {
YourBroadcastReceiver(handler = { processInstanceUuid -> /* do your own logic to refresh `ProcessContent()` */ })
}
val context = LocalContext.current
LifecycleStartEffect(true) {
ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context.applicationContext, yourBroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter("some.intent.filter.indentifier"), ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED)
onStopOrDispose {
runCatching {
context.applicationContext.unregisterReceiver(yourBroadcastReceiver)
}
}
}
ProcessContent()
}
}
@Composable
private fun ProcessContent(...) { ... }
}
class YourBroadcastReceiver(private val handler: (String) -> Unit) : BroadcastReceiver() {
override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {
intent?.extras?.getString("processInstanceUuid")?.let { processUuid -> handler.invoke(processUuid) }
}
}
```

# Angular SDK
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/sdks/angular-renderer
FlowxProcessRenderer is a library designed to render the UI of processes created via the Flowx Process Designer.
<Warning>
**Breaking changes**: Starting with version 4.0 the ui-sdk will no longer expect the authToken to be present in the `LOCAL_STORAGE`. Instead, the authToken will be passed as an input to the flx-process-renderer component. This is mandatory for the SSE to work properly.
</Warning>
## Prerequisites
* Node.js min version 20 - [**Download Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.9.0)
* Angular CLI version 19. Install Angular CLI globally using the following command:
```npm
npm install -g @angular/cli@19
```
This will allow you to run ng related commands from the terminal.
## Angular project requirements
Your app MUST be created using the NG app from the @angular/cli\~19 package. It also MUST use SCSS for styling.
```npm
npm install -g @angular/cli@19
ng new my-flowx-app
```
<Check>
To install the npm libraries provided by FLOWX you will need to obtain access to the private FlowX Nexus registry. Please consult with your project DevOps.
</Check>
<Info>
The library uses Angular version **@angular\~19**, **npm v10.1.0** and **node v20.9.0**.
</Info>
<Check>
If you are using an older version of Angular (for example, v16), please consult the following link for update instructions:
[**Update Angular from v16.0 to v19.0**](https://angular.dev/update-guide?v=16.0-19.0\&l=1)
</Check>
## Installing the library
Use the following command to install the **renderer** library and its required dependencies:
```bash
npm install \
@flowx/core-sdk@<version>\
@flowx/core-theme@<version> \
@flowx/angular-sdk@<version> \
@flowx/angular-theme@<version> \
@flowx/angular-ui-toolkit@<version> \
@angular/cdk@19 \
@types/event-source-polyfill
```
<Warning>
Replace `<version>` with the correct version corresponding to your platform version.
To find the right version, navigate to: **Release Notes → Choose your platform version → Deployment guidelines → Component versions**.
</Warning>
A few configurations are needed in the projects `angular.json`:
* in order to successfully link the pdf viewer, add the following declaration in the assets property:
```json
{
"glob": "**/*",
"input": "node_modules/ng2-pdfjs-viewer/pdfjs",
"output": "/assets/pdfjs"
}
```
## Initial setup
Once installed, `FlxProcessModule` will be imported in the `AppModule` as `FlxProcessModule.withConfig({})`.
You **MUST** also import the dependencies of `FlxProcessModule`: `HttpClientModule` from `@angular/common/http`
### Theming
Component theming is done through the `@flowx/angular-theme` library. The theme id is a required input for the renderer SDK component and is used to fetch the theme configuration. The id can be obtained from the admin panel in the themes section.

</Frame>
### Authorization
<Info>
Every request from the **FlowX** renderer SDK will be made using the **HttpClientModule** of the client app, which means those requests will go through every interceptor you define here. This is most important to know when building the auth method as it will be the job of the client app to intercept and decorate the requests with the necessary auth info (eg. `Authorziation: Bearer ...`).
</Info>
<Info>
It's the responsibility of the client app to implement the authorization flow (using the **OpenID Connect** standard). The renderer SDK will expect the authToken to be passed to the `flx-process-renderer` as an input.
</Info>
```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule, HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
import { FlxProcessModule } from '@flowx/angular-sdk';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
@NgModule({
declarations: [
AppComponent,
],
imports: [
BrowserModule,
AppRoutingModule,
// will be used by the renderer SDK to make requests
HttpClientModule,
// needed by the renderer SDK
FlxProcessModule.withConfig({
components: {},
services: {},
}),
],
// this interceptor with decorate the requests with the Authorization header
providers: [
{ provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true },
],
bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
The `withConfig()` call is required in the application module where the process will be rendered. The `withConfig()` method accepts a config argument where you can pass extra config info, register a **custom component**, **service**, or **custom validators**.
**Custom components** will be referenced by name when creating the template config for a user task.
**Custom validators** will be referenced by name (`currentOrLastYear`) in the template config panel in the validators section of each generated form field.
```typescript
// example with custom component, custom services and custom validator
FlxProcessModule.withConfig({
components: {
YourCustomComponentIdentifier: CustomComponent,
},
services: {
NomenclatorService,
LocalDataStoreService,
},
validators: { currentOrLastYear },
})
// example of a custom validator that restricts data selection to
// the current or the previous year
currentOrLastYear: function currentOrLastYear(AC: AbstractControl): { [key: string]: any } {
if (!AC) {
return null;
}
const yearDate = moment(AC.value, YEAR_FORMAT, true);
const currentDateYear = moment(new Date()).startOf('year');
const lastYear = moment(new Date()).subtract(1, 'year').startOf('year');
if (!yearDate.isSame(currentDateYear) && !yearDate.isSame(lastYear)) {
return { currentOrLastYear: true };
}
return null;
}
```
<Warning>
The error that the validator returns **MUST** match the validator name.
</Warning>

### Data and actions
Custom components will be hydrated with data through the \$data input observable which must be defined in the custom component class.
```typescript
@Component({
selector: 'my-custom-component',
templateUrl: './custom-component.component.html',
styleUrls: ['./custom-component.component.scss'],
})
export class CustomComponentComponent  {
data$ = input<Observable<any> | null>(null)
}
```
Component actions are always found under `data` -> `actionsFn` key.
Action names are configurable via the process editor.
```typescript
# data object example
data: {
actionsFn: {
action_one: () => void;
action_two: () => void;
}
}
```
#### Custom component validation
Custom components can validate their own status. We can inject the `FLX_VALIDATOR_SERVICE` service and use it to validate the component. Whe service exposes the following properties:
* `validate(isValid: boolean)` - used to validate the component
* `saveData(data: any)` - used to save data
* `validated$` - used to monitor external submission from the process
Example of the a custom component that validates an input with a required validator:
```ts
@Component({
selector: 'flx-custom-validation',
imports: [CommonModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
template: `
Custom validation:
<input [formControl]="fc" />
@if (formSubmitted() && fc.invalid) {
<span>error</span>
}
`
})
export class FlxCustomValidationComponent implements OnInit {
data$ = input<Observable<any> | null>(null) // can be used to get process data & actions
validationService = inject(FLX_VALIDATOR_SERVICE) // service used to validate the custom component - ony use in components that need validation
fc = new FormControl('', Validators.required) // the form control has a required validator.
formSubmitted = signal(false)
ngOnInit(): void {
// update validity
this.fc.statusChanges.subscribe((status) => {
this.validationService.validate(status === 'VALID')
})
// save data
this.fc.valueChanges.subscribe((value) => {
this.validationService.saveData({ app: { test1: value, test2: `${value}${value}` } })
})
// monitor external submission
this.validationService.validated$.subscribe(() => {
this.formSubmitted.set(true)
})
}
}
```
### Custom Interceptors
* Starting from the FlowX SDKs version 4.6, the Angular `HttpClientModule` is no longer used internally to make HTTP requests. Thus, we have a new mechanism that allows you to create custom interceptors for handling HTTP requests.
#### Request Interceptors
* Here is an example that illustrates how to create an interceptor that adds a custom header to all outgoing requests:
```typescript
// Import the necessary types
import { FLX_REQUEST_INTERCEPTORS_CONFIG } from '@flowx/angular-sdk'
import { HttpRequestInterceptor } from '@flowx/core-sdk'
// create the interceptor factory function
const customHeaderInterceptor: HttpRequestInterceptor[] = [
{
onFulfilled: (response) => {
response.headers['custom-header'] = 'custom-value'
return response
},
}
]
// Add the interceptor to the providers array in the main app module
{
provide: FLX_REQUEST_INTERCEPTORS_CONFIG,
useValue: customHeaderInterceptor,
}
```
#### Response Interceptors
* Here is an example that illustrates how to create an interceptor that shows a message when a response errors out:
```typescript
import { FLX_RESPONSE_INTERCEPTORS_CONFIG } from '@flowx/angular-sdk'
import { HttpResponseInterceptor } from '@flowx/core-sdk'
const customHErrorInterceptor: HttpResponseInterceptor[] = [
{
onRejected: (response) => {
if (response.status !== 200) {
console.error('Something went wrong, we should handle this!', response.message)
}
return response
}
}
]
// Add the interceptor to the providers array in the main app module
{
provide: FLX_RESPONSE_INTERCEPTORS_CONFIG,
useValue: customHErrorInterceptor,
}
```
#### Interceptors that use Dependency injection
* If you need to use a service in your interceptor, you can use provider factories coupled with the `deps` property to inject the service into the interceptor:
```typescript
// the interceptor factory function that receives the custom service as an argument through dependency injection:
const interceptor: (custom: any) => HttpRequestInterceptor[] = (customService: CustomService) => [{
onFulfilled: (response) => {
// do something with the custom service
// interceptor logic
return response
}
}]
// Add the interceptor to the providers array in the main app module
{
provide: FLX_REQUEST_INTERCEPTORS_CONFIG,
useFactory: (customService: CustomService) => [
interceptorFactory(customService),
],
deps: [CustomService], // provider factory dependencies
}
```
### Using custom icons
The SDK provides a mechanism for using custom icons. Providers for custom icons should be included in the main app module in order to be available for the whole application.
```ts
import { FlxIconModule } from '@flowx/angular-ui-toolkit'
// create a custom dictionary of icons
const customIconDictionary = {
'custom-icon': 'custom icon svg'
}
// add the custom icon dictionary to the providers array in the main app module.
providers: [
...
importProvidersFrom(FlxIconModule),
provideExtraIconSet(customIconDictionary),
]
```
### Enumerations and translations
The SDK library provides a mechanism for handling enumerations and translations. The api for the method that handles enumerations is provided by the `getEnumeration` method which is `Promise` based.
<Warning>
These methods should only be used in custom components and within a process context because internal requests depend on the presence of a running project details.
</Warning>
#### Custom enumerations
```ts
import {getEnumeration} from '@flowx/angular-sdk'
// get an enumeration by name
const enumeration = await getEnumeration('enumerationName')
// get enumeration with a parent
const enumeration = await getEnumeration('enumerationName', 'parentName')
// get enumerations and cache the result for subsequent calls
const enumerations = await getEnumerations('enumerationName', null, true)
```
#### Translations
The SDK provides a `FlxLocalizePipe` that allows you to manage translations within your application. The pipe is standalone and can be used both in templates and in custom components.
* Here is an example of how to use the pipe in a template:
```ts
// import the pipe in the module where you want to use it
import { FlxLocalizePipe } from '@flowx/angular-sdk'
imports: [
...
FlxLocalizePipe
]
```
```html
<!-- use the pipe in the template of a custom component -->
<span>{{ 'hello' | flxLocalize }}</span>
```
* Here is an example of how to use the pipe in a custom component:
```ts
const localize = new FlxLocalizePipe()
const translatedText = localize.transform('@@substitution_tag')
```
### Caching
The SDK provides a caching mechanism for static resources. The cache is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the `cache` input of the `flx-process-renderer` component to `false`. When turned on, the cache will store the static resources in the browser's cache storage.
In order to reset the cache, you can go to the `Application` (Chrome) or `Storage` (Firefox) tab in the browser Dev tools and either clear the cache or disable the cache for the current site.
|   Browser   |  Dev Tools Tab  |                                                                Screenshot                                                                |
| :---------: | :-------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  **Chrome** | Application tab | <Frame caption="Chrome - Application tab">![Chrome Cache](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/chrome_cahce.png)</Frame> |
| **Firefox** |   Storage tab   |  <Frame caption="Firefox - Storage tab">![Firefox Cache](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/470/firefox_cache.png)</Frame> |
**How to clear the cache**:
* **Chrome**: Navigate to Application → Storage → Cache storage → Right-click on "flowx-resources-cache" → Clear
* **Firefox**: Navigate to Storage → Cache Storage → Right-click → Clear
### Interacting with the process
Data from the process is communicated via the **Server Send Event** protocol under the following keys:
| Name            |                                        Description                                       | Example |   |
| --------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----: | - |
| Data            |             data updates for process model bound to default/custom components            |         |   |
| ProcessMetadata | updates about process metadata, ex: progress update, data about how to render components |         |   |
| RunAction       |                       instructs the UI to perform the given action                       |         |   |
### Task management component
The `flx-task-manager` component is available in the `FlxTaskManagementComponent`. To use it, import the required module in your Angular project:
```bash
import { FlxTasksManagementComponent } from '@flowx/angular-sdk';
```
#### Usage
Include the component in your template:
```xml
<flx-task-management
[apiUrl]="apiUrl"
[authToken]="accessToken"
[appId]="appId()"
[language]="language()"
[themeId]="themeId()"
[staticAssetsPath]="staticUrl"
[viewDefinitionId]="viewDefinitionId()"
[locale]="locale()"
[buildId]="buildId()"
></flx-task-management>
```

#### Coding style tests
Always follow the Angular official [coding styles](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).
Below you will find a Storybook which will demonstrate how components behave under different states, props, and conditions, it allows you to preview and interact with individual UI components in isolation, without the need for a full-fledged application:
<Card title="Storybook (v4.7.0)" href="https://storybooks.flowxai.dev/" icon="book" />
# iOS SDK
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/sdks/ios-renderer
# Using the iOS Renderer
## iOS Project Requirements
The minimum requirements are:
* iOS 15
* Swift 5.7
## Installing the library
The iOS Renderer is available through Cocoapods.
### Cocoapods
#### Prerequisites
* Cocoapods gem installed
#### Cocoapods private trunk setup
Add the private trunk repo to your local Cocoapods installation with the command:
```ruby
pod repo add flowx-specs git@github.com:flowx-ai-external/flowx-ios-specs.git
```
#### Adding the dependency
Add the source of the private repository in the Podfile
```ruby
source 'git@github.com:flowx-ai-external/flowx-ios-specs.git'
```
Add a post install hook in the Podfile setting `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION` to `YES`.
```ruby
post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
target.build_configurations.each do |config|
config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
end
end
end
```
Add the pod and then run `pod install`
```ruby
pod 'FlowX'
```
Example
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/flowx-ai-external/flowx-ios-specs.git'

# Pods for testing
end
target 'AppTemplateUITests' do
# Pods for testing
end
end
```
### Library dependencies
* Alamofire
* SDWebImageSwiftUI
* SDWebImageSVGCoder
## Configuring the library
The SDK has 2 configurations, available through shared instances: `FXConfig` which holds general purpose properties, and `FXSessionConfig` which holds user session properties.
It is recommended to call the `FXConfig` configuration method at app launch.
Call the FXSessionConfig configure method after the user logs in and a valid user session is available.
### FXConfig
This config is used for general purpose properties.
#### Properties
| Name         | Description                                                         | Type   | Requirement                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| baseURL      | The base URL used for REST networking                               | String | Mandatory                      |
| enginePath   | The process engine url path component                               | String | Mandatory                      |
| imageBaseURL | The base URL used for static assets                                 | String | Mandatory                      |
| locale       | The locale used for localization                                    | String | Mandatory. Defaults to "en-us" |
| language     | The language used for retrieving enumerations and substitution tags | String | Mandatory. Defaults to "en"    |
| logLevel     | Enum value indicating the log level logging. Default is none        | Bool   | Optional                       |
**Sample**
```swift
FXConfig.sharedInstance.configure { (config) in
config.baseURL = myBaseURL
config.enginePath = "engine"
config.imageBaseURL = myImageBaseURL
config.locale = "en-us"
config.language = "en"
config.logLevel = .verbose
}
```
#### Changing the current language
The current language and locale can be changed after the initial configuration, by calling the `changeLocaleSettings` method:
```swift
FXConfig.sharedInstance.changeLocaleSettings(locale: "ro-ro",
language: "en")
```
### FXSessionConfig
This config is used for providing networking or auth session-specific properties.
The library expects either the JWT access token or an Alamofire Session instance managed by the container app. In case a session object is provided, the request adapting should be handled by the container app.
#### Properties
| Name           | Description                                         | Type    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| sessionManager | Alamofire session instance used for REST networking | Session |
| token          | JWT authentication access token                     | String  |
#### Sample for access token
```swift
...
func configureFlowXSession() {
FXSessionConfig.sharedInstance.configure { config in
config.token = myAccessToken
}
}
```
#### Sample for session
```swift
import Alamofire
```
```swift
...
func configureFlowXSession() {
FXSessionConfig.sharedInstance.configure { config in
config.sessionManager = Session(interceptor: MyRequestInterceptor())
}
}
```
```swift
class MyRequestInterceptor: RequestInterceptor {
func adapt(_ urlRequest: URLRequest, for session: Session, completion: @escaping (Swift.Result<URLRequest, Error>) -> Void) {
var urlRequest = urlRequest
urlRequest.setValue("Bearer " + accessToken, forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
completion(.success(urlRequest))
}
}
```
### Theming
<Warning>Make sure the `FXSessionConfig` configure method was called with a valid session before setting up the theme.</Warning>
Before starting or resuming a process, the theme setup API should be called.
The start or continue process APIs should be called only after the theme setup was completed.
### Theme setup
The setup theme is called using the shared instance of `FXTheme`
```swift
public func setupTheme(withUuid uuid: String,
localFileUrl: URL? = nil,
completion: (() -> Void)?)
```
* `uuid` - the UUID of the theme configured in the FlowX Designer.
* `localFileUrl` - optional parameter for providing a fallback theme file, in case the fetch theme request fails.
* `completion` - a completion closure called when the theme setup finishes.
In addition to the `completion` parameter, FXTheme's shared instance also provides a Combine publisher named `themeFetched` which sends `true` if the theme setup was finished.
#### Sample
```swift
FXTheme.sharedInstance.setupTheme(withUuid: myThemeUuid,
localFileUrl: Bundle.main.url(forResource: "theme", withExtension: "json"),
completion: {
print("theme setup finished")
})
```
```swift
...
var subscription: AnyCancellable?
func myMethodForThemeSetupFinished() {
subscription = FXTheme.sharedInstance.themeFetched.sink { result in
if result {
DispatchQueue.main.async {
// you can now start/continue a process
}
}
}
}
}
...
```
## Using the library
### Public API
The library's public APIs described in this section are called using the shared instance of FlowX, `FlowX.sharedInstance`.
### Check renderer compatibility
Before using the iOS SDK, it is recommended to check the compatibility between the renderer and the deployed FlowX services.
This can be done by calling the `checkRendererVersion` which has a completion handler containing a Bool value.
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.checkRendererVersion { compatible in
print(compatible)
}
```
### How to start and end FlowX session
After all the configurations are set, you can start a FlowX session by calling the `startSession()` method.
This is optional, as the session starts lazily when the first process is started.
`FlowX.sharedInstance.startSession()`
When you want to end a FlowX session, you can call the `endSession()` method. This also does a complete clean-up of the started processes.
You might want to use this method in a variety of scenarios, for instance when the user logs out.
`FlowX.sharedInstance.endSession()`
### How to start a process
There are 3 methods available for starting a FlowX process.
The container app is responsible with presenting the navigation controller or tab controller holding the process navigation.
1. Start a process which renders inside an instance of `UINavigationController` or `UITabBarController`, depending on the BPMN diagram of the process.
The controller to be presented will be provided inside the `completion` closure parameter of the method.
<Tip>Use this method when you want the process to be rendered inside a controller themed using the FlowX Theme defined in the FlowX Designer.</Tip>
```swift
public func startProcess(projectId: String,
name: String,
params: [String: Any]?,
isModal: Bool = false,
showLoader: Bool = false,
completion: ((UIViewController?) -> Void)?,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
* `projectId` - the uuid of the project
* `name` - the name of the process
* `params` - the start parameters, if any
* `isModal` - a boolean indicating whether the process navigation is modally displayed. When the process navigation is displayed modally, a close bar button item is displayed on each screen displayed throughout the process navigation.
* `showLoader` - a boolean indicating whether the loader should be displayed when starting the process.
* `completion` - a completion closure which passes either an instance of `UINavigationController` or `UITabBarController` to be presented.
* `onProcessEnded` - a closure called when the process ends. The closure is strongly referenced inside the SDK. Avoid reference cycles by using \[weak self]
2. Start a process which renders inside a provided instance of a `UINavigationController`.
<Tip>Use this method when you want the process to be rendered inside a custom instance of `UINavigationController`.<br />Optionally you can pass an instance of `FXNavigationViewController`, which has the appearance set in the FlowX Theme, using the `FXNavigationViewController`s class func `FXNavigationViewController.navigationController()`.</Tip>
If you use this method, make sure that the process does not use a tab controller as root view.
```swift
public func startProcess(navigationController: UINavigationController,
projectId: String,
name: String,
params: [String: Any]?,
isModal: Bool = false,
showLoader: Bool = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
* `navigationController` - the instance of UINavigationController which will hold the process navigation stack
* `projectId` - the uuid of the project
* `name` - the name of the process
* `params` - the start parameters, if any
* `isModal` - a boolean indicating whether the process navigation is modally displayed. When the process navigation is displayed modally, a close bar button item is displayed on each screen displayed throughout the process navigation.
* `showLoader` - a boolean indicating whether the loader should be displayed when starting the process.
* `onProcessEnded` - a closure called when the process ends. The closure is strongly referenced inside the SDK. Avoid reference cycles by using \[weak self]
3. Start a process which renders inside a provided instance of a `UITabBarController`.
<Tip>Use this method when you want the process to be rendered inside a custom instance of `UITabBarController`.</Tip>
<Warning>If you use this method, make sure that the process has a tab controller as root view.</Warning>
```swift
public func startProcess(tabBarController: UITabBarController,
projectId: String,
name: String,
params: [String: Any]?,
isModal: Bool = false,
showLoader: Bool = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
* `tabBarController` - the instance of UITabBarController which will hold the process navigation
* `projectId` - the uuid of the project
* `name` - the name of the process
* `params` - the start parameters, if any
* `isModal` - a boolean indicating whether the process navigation is modally displayed. When the process navigation is displayed modally, a close bar button item is displayed on each screen displayed throughout the process navigation.
* `showLoader` - a boolean indicating whether the loader should be displayed when starting the process.
* `onProcessEnded` - a closure called when the process ends. The closure is strongly referenced inside the SDK. Avoid reference cycles by using \[weak self]
#### Sample
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.startProcess(projectId: projectId,
name: processName,
params: [:],
isModal: true,
showLoader: true) { processRootViewController in
if let processRootViewController = processRootViewController {
processRootViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
self.present(processRootViewController, animated: false)
}
} onProcessEnded: { [weak self] in
//TODO
}
```
or
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.startProcess(navigationController: processNavigationController,
projectId: projectId,
name: processName,
params: startParams,
isModal: true
showLoader: true)
self.present(processNavigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
or
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.startProcess(tabBarController: processTabController,

```
### How to resume an existing process
There are 3 methods available for resuming a FlowX process.
The container app is responsible with presenting the navigation controller or tab controller holding the process navigation.
1. Continue a process which renders inside an instance of `UINavigationController` or `UITabBarController`, depending on the BPMN diagram of the process.
The controller to be presented will be provided inside the `completion` closure parameter of the method.
<Tip>Use this method when you want the process to be rendered inside a controller themed using the FlowX Theme defined in the FlowX Designer. </Tip>
```swift
public func continueExistingProcess(uuid: String,
name: String,
isModal: Bool = false,
completion: ((UIViewController?) -> Void)? = nil,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
* `name` - the name of the process
* `isModal` - a boolean indicating whether the process navigation is modally displayed. When the process navigation is displayed modally, a close bar button item is displayed on each screen displayed throughout the process navigation.
* `showLoader` - a boolean indicating whether the loader should be displayed when starting the process.
* `completion` - a completion closure which passes either an instance of `UINavigationController` or `UITabBarController` to be presented.
* `onProcessEnded` - a closure called when the process ends. The closure is strongly referenced inside the SDK. Avoid reference cycles by using \[weak self]
2. Continue a process which renders inside a provided instance of a `UINavigationController`.
<Tip>Use this method when you want the process to be rendered inside a custom instance of `UINavigationController`.<br />Optionally you can pass an instance of `FXNavigationViewController`, which has the appearance set in the FlowX Theme, using the `FXNavigationViewController`s class func `FXNavigationViewController.navigationController()`.</Tip>
If you use this method, make sure that the process does not use a tab controller as root view.
```swift
public func continueExistingProcess(uuid: String,
name: String,
navigationController: UINavigationController,
isModal: Bool = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
* `uuid` - the UUID string of the process
* `name` - the name of the process
* `navigationController` - the instance of UINavigationController which will hold the process navigation stack
* `isModal` - a boolean indicating whether the process navigation is modally displayed. When the process navigation is displayed modally, a close bar button item is displayed on each screen displayed throughout the process navigation.
* `onProcessEnded` - a closure called when the process ends. The closure is strongly referenced inside the SDK. Avoid reference cycles by using \[weak self]
3. Continue a process which renders inside a provided instance of a `UITabBarController`.
<Tip>Use this method when you want the process to be rendered inside a custom instance of `UITabBarController`.</Tip>
<Warning>If you use this method, make sure that the process has a tab controller as root view.</Warning>
```swift
public func continueExistingProcess(uuid: String,
name: String,
tabBarController: UITabBarController,
isModal: Bool = false,
onProcessEnded: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
* `uuid` - the UUID string of the process
* `name` - the name of the process
* `tabBarController` - the instance of UITabBarController which will hold the process navigation
* `isModal` - a boolean indicating whether the process navigation is modally displayed. When the process navigation is displayed modally, a close bar button item is displayed on each screen displayed throughout the process navigation.
* `onProcessEnded` - a closure called when the process ends. The closure is strongly referenced inside the SDK. Avoid reference cycles by using \[weak self]
#### Sample
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.continueExistingProcess(uuid: uuid,
name: processName,
isModal: true) { processRootViewController in
if let processRootViewController = processRootViewController {
processRootViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
self.present(processRootViewController, animated: true)
}
} onProcessEnded: { [weak self] in
}
```
or
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.continueExistingProcess(uuid: uuid,
name: processName,
navigationController: processNavigationController,
isModal: true)
processNavigationController.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
self.present(processNavigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
or
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.continueExistingProcess(uuid: uuid,
name: processName,
tabBarController: processTabBarController,
isModal: false)
processTabBarController.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
self.present(processTabBarController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
### How to end a process
You can manually end a process by calling the `stopProcess(name: String)` method.
This is useful when you want to explicitly ask the FlowX shared instance to clean up the instance of the process sent as parameter.
For example, it could be used for modally displayed processes that are dismissed by the user, in which case the `dismissRequested(forProcess process: String, navigationController: UINavigationController)` method of the FXDataSource will be called.
#### Sample
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.stopProcess(name: processName)
```
### FXDataSource
The library offers a way of communication with the container app through the `FXDataSource` protocol.
The data source is a public property of FlowX shared instance.
`public weak var dataSource: FXDataSource?`
```swift
public protocol FXDataSource: AnyObject {
func controllerFor(componentIdentifier: String) -> FXController?
func viewFor(componentIdentifier: String) -> FXView?
func viewFor(componentIdentifier: String, customComponentViewModel: FXCustomComponentViewModel) -> AnyView?
func navigationController() -> UINavigationController?
func errorReceivedForAction(name: String?)
func validate(validatorName: String, value: String) -> Bool
func dismissRequested(forProcess process: String, navigationController: UINavigationController)
func viewForStepperHeader(stepViewModel: StepViewModel) -> AnyView?
func track(event: TrackEvent)
func newProcessStarted(processInstanceUuid: String)
}
```
* `func controllerFor(componentIdentifier: String) -> FXController?`
This method is used for providing a custom component using UIKit UIViewController, identified by the componentIdentifier argument.
* `func viewFor(componentIdentifier: String) -> FXView?`
This method is used for providing a custom component using UIKit UIView, identified by the componentIdentifier argument.
* `func viewFor(componentIdentifier: String, customComponentViewModel: FXCustomComponentViewModel) -> AnyView?`
This method is used for providing a custom component using SwiftUI View, identified by the componentIdentifier argument.
A view model is provided as an ObservableObject to be added as @ObservedObject inside the SwiftUI view for component data observation.
* `func navigationController() -> UINavigationController?`
This method is used for providing a navigation controller. It can be either a custom `UINavigationController` class, or just a regular `UINavigationController` instance themed by the container app.
* `func errorReceivedForAction(name: String?)`
This method is called when an error occurs after an action is executed.
* `func validate(validatorName: String, value: String) -> Bool`
This method is used for custom validators. It provides the name of the validator and the value to be validated. The method returns a boolean indicating whether the value is valid or not.
* `func dismissRequested(forProcess process: String, navigationController: UINavigationController)`
This method is called, on a modally displayed process navigation, when the user attempts to dismiss the modal navigation. Typically it is used when you want to present a confirmation pop-up.
The container app is responsible with dismissing the UI and calling the stop process APIs.
* `func viewForStepperHeader(stepViewModel: StepViewModel) -> AnyView?`
This method is used for providing a custom SwiftUI view for the stepper navigation header.
* `func track(event: TrackEvent)`
This method is used for collecting analytics events from the SDK. The parameter is a `TrackEvent` enum, which can represent a screen or an action.
```swift
public enum TrackEvent {
case screen(String)
case action(String)
}
```
* `func newProcessStarted(processInstanceUuid: String)`
This method is used for handling the start of another main process as a result of a `START_PROJECT` action. The parameter is the uuid of the process instance. The container app is responsible for dismissing the navigation of the current process and displaying the new process navigation.
#### Sample
```swift
class MyFXDataSource: FXDataSource {
func controllerFor(componentIdentifier: String) -> FXController? {
switch componentIdentifier {
case "customComponent1":
let customComponent: CustomViewController = viewController()
return customComponent
default:
return nil
}
}
func viewFor(componentIdentifier: String) -> FXView? {
switch componentIdentifier {
case "customComponent2":
return CustomView()
default:
return nil
}
}
func viewFor(componentIdentifier: String, customComponentViewModel: FXCustomComponentViewModel) -> AnyView? {
switch componentIdentifier {
case "customComponent2":
return AnyView(SUICustomView(viewModel: customComponentViewModel))
default:
return nil
}
}
func navigationController() -> UINavigationController? {
nil
}
func errorReceivedForAction(name: String?) {
}
func validate(validatorName: String, value: Any) -> Bool {
switch validatorName {
case "myCustomValidator":
let myCustomValidator = MyCustomValidator(input: value as? String)
return myCustomValidator.isValid()
default:
return true
}
}
func dismissRequested(forProcess process: String, navigationController: UINavigationController) {
navigationController.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
FlowX.sharedInstance.stopProcess(name: process)
}
func viewForStepperHeader(stepViewModel: StepViewModel) -> AnyView? {
return AnyView(CustomStepperHeaderView(stepViewModel: stepViewModel))
}
func track(event: TrackEvent) {
//TODO: track event using the desired analytics tool.
}
func newProcessStarted(processInstanceUuid: String) {
//TODO present new process instance navigation
}
}
```
### Custom components
#### FXController
FXController is an open class subclassing UIViewController, which helps the container app provide full custom screens the renderer.
It needs to be subclassed for each custom screen.
<Warning>Use this only when the custom component configured in the UI Designer is the root component of the User Task node.</Warning>
```swift
open class FXController: UIViewController {
internal(set) public var data: Any?
internal(set) public var actions: [ProcessActionModel]?
open func titleForScreen() -> String? {
return nil
}
open func populateUI() {
}
open func updateUI() {
}
}
```
* `internal(set) public var data: Any?`
`data` is the property, containing the data model for the custom component. The type is Any, as it could be a primitive value, a dictionary or an array, depending on the component configuration.
* `internal(set) public var actions: [ProcessActionModel]?`
`actions` is the array of actions provided to the custom component.
* `func titleForScreen() -> String?`
This method is used for setting the screen title. It is called by the renderer when the view controller is displayed.
* `func populateUI()`
This method is called by the renderer, after the controller has been presented, when the data is available.
This will happen asynchronously. It is the container app's responsibility to make sure that the initial state of the view controller does not have default/residual values displayed.
* `func updateUI()`
This method is called by the renderer when an already displayed view controller needs to update the data shown.
#### FXView
FXView is a protocol that helps the container app provide custom UIKit subviews to the renderer. It needs to be implemented by `UIView` instances. Similar to `FXController` it has data and actions properties and a populate method.
```swift
public protocol FXView: UIView {
var data: Any? { get set }
var actions: [ProcessActionModel]? { get set }
func populateUI()
}
```
* `var data: [String: Any]?`
`data` is the property, containing the data model for the custom view. The type is Any, as it could be a primitive value, a dictionary or an array, depending on the component configuration.
* `var actions: [ProcessActionModel]?`
`actions` is the array of actions provided to the custom view.
* `func populateUI()`
This method is called by the renderer after the screen containing the view has been displayed.
It is the container app's responsibility to make sure that the initial state of the view does not have default/residual values displayed.
<Warning>It is mandatory for views implementing the FXView protocol to provide the intrinsic content size.</Warning>
```swift
override var intrinsicContentSize: CGSize {
return CGSize(width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width, height: 100)
}
```
#### SwiftUI Custom components
Custom SwiftUI components can be provided as type-erased views.
`FXCustomComponentViewModel` is a class implementing the `ObservableObject` protocol. It is used for managing the state of custom SwiftUI views.
It has two published properties, for data and actions. It also includes a `saveData` dictionary and a `validate` closure used for submitting and validating data from the custom components.
```swift
@Published public var data: Any?
@Published public var actions: [ProcessActionModel] = []
public var saveData: [String: Any]?
public var validate: (() -> Bool)?
```
Example
```swift
struct SampleView: View {
@ObservedObject var viewModel: FXCustomComponentViewModel
var body: some View {
Text("Lorem")
}
}
```
### Validating SwiftUI Custom Components
A SwiftUI Custom Component can validate and submit data from a custom component, when executing an action from a FlowX.AI UI Component.
* `public var saveData: [String: Any]?`
Used for setting data to be submitted from the custom component.
* `public var validate: (() -> Bool)?`
Used for validating the custom component data before executing the action.
#### Sample
```swift
struct MyCustomView: View {
@ObservedObject var viewModel: FXCustomComponentViewModel
var body: some View {
VStack {
...
}
.onAppear {
viewModel.saveData = ["customKey": "customValue"]
viewModel.validate = {
return true
}
}
.frame(height: 200)
}
}
```
### Custom header view for Stepper navigation
The container application can provide a custom view that will be used as the stepper navigation header, using the `FXDataSource` protocol method `viewForStepperHeader`.
The method has a parameter, which provides the data needed for populating the view's UI.
```swift
public struct StepViewModel {
// title for the current step; optional
public var stepTitle: String?
// title for the current substep, if there is a stepper in stepper configured; optional
public var substepTitle: String?
// 1-based index of the current step
public var step: Int
// total number of steps
public var totalSteps: Int
// 1-based index of the current substep, if there is a stepper in stepper configured; optional
public var substep: Int?
// total number of substeps in the current step, if there is a stepper in stepper configured; optional
public var totalSubsteps: Int?
}
```
#### Sample
```swift
struct CustomStepperHeaderView: View {
let viewModel: StepViewModel
var body: some View {
VStack(spacing: 16) {
ProgressView(value: Float(stepViewModel.step) / Float(stepViewModel.totalSteps))
.foregroundStyle(Color.blue)
if let stepTitle = stepViewModel.stepTitle {
Text(stepTitle)
}
if let substepTitle = stepViewModel.substepTitle {
Text(substepTitle)
}
}
.background(Color.white)
.shadow(radius: 10)
}
}
```
### How to run an action from a custom component
The custom components which the container app provides will contain FlowX actions to be executed. In order to run an action you need to call the following method:
```swift
public func runAction(action: ProcessActionModel,
params: [String: Any]? = nil)
```
`action` - the `ProcessActionModel` action object
`params` - the parameters for the action
### How to run an upload action from a custom component
```swift
public func runUploadAction(action: ProcessActionModel,
image: UIImage)
```
`action` - the `ProcessActionModel` action object
`image` - the image to upload
```swift
public func runUploadAction(action: ProcessActionModel,
fileURL: URL)
```
`action` - the `ProcessActionModel` action object
`fileURL` - the local URL of the image
### Getting a substitution tag value by key
```swift
public func getTag(withKey key: String) -> String?
```
All substitution tags will be retrieved by the SDK before starting the first process and will be stored in memory.&#x20;
Whenever the container app needs a substitution tag value for populating the UI of the custom components, it can request the substitution tag using the method above, providing the key.
### Getting a media item url by key
```swift
public func getMediaItemURL(withKey key: String) -> String?
```
All media items will be retrieved by the SDK before starting the first process and will be stored in memory.
Whenever the container app needs a media item url for populating the UI of the custom components, it can request the url using the method above, providing the key.
### Handling authorization token changes
When the access token of the auth session changes, you can update it in the renderer using the `func updateAuthorization(token: String)` method.
```swift
FlowX.sharedInstance.updateAuthorization(token: accessToken)
```
# React SDK
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/sdks/react-renderer
The FlowxProcessRenderer is a low code library designed to render UI configured via the Flowx Process Editor.
## React project requirements
Your app MUST use SCSS for styling.
<Check>
To install the npm libraries provided by FLOWX you will need to obtain access to the private FLOWX Nexus registry. Please consult with your project DevOps.
</Check>
<Info>
The library uses React version **react\~18**, **npm v10.8.0** and **node v18.16.9**.
</Info>
## Installing the library
Use the following command to install the **renderer** library and its required dependencies:
<Check>
Installing `react` and `react-dom` can be skipped if you already have them installed in your project.
</Check>
```bash
npm install \
react@18 \
react-dom@18 \
@flowx/core-sdk@<version> \
@flowx/core-theme@<version> \
@flowx/react-sdk@<version> \
@flowx/react-theme@<version> \
@flowx/react-ui-toolkit@<version> \
air-datepicker@3 \
axios \
ag-grid-react@32
```
<Warning>
Replace `<version>` with the correct version corresponding to your platform version.
To find the right version, navigate to: **Release Notes → Choose your platform version → Deployment guidelines → Component versions**.
</Warning>
## Initial setup
Once installed, `FlxProcessRenderer` will be imported in the from the `@flowx/react-sdk` package.
### Theming
Component theming is done through the `@flowx/react-theme` library. The theme id is a required input for the renderer SDK component and is used to fetch the theme configuration. The id can be obtained from the admin panel in the themes section.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/2024-04-08%2013.45.10.gif)
</Frame>
### Authorization
<Info>
It's the responsibility of the client app to implement the authorization flow (using the **OpenID Connect** standard). The renderer SDK will expect the authToken to be passed to the `FlxProcessRenderer` as an input.
</Info>
```typescript.tsx
import { FlxProcessRenderer } from '@flowx/react-sdk';
export function MyFlxContainer() {
return <FlxProcessRenderer
apiUrl={'your API url'}
language={...}
authToken={...}
processName={...}
processStartData={...}
processApiPath={...}
themeId="12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
staticAssetsPath={...}
locale="en-US"
language="en"
projectInfo={
projectId: ...
}
/>
}
```
The `FlxProcessRenderer` component is required in the application module where the process will be rendered. The component accepts a props where you can pass extra config info, register a **custom component** or **custom validators**.
**Custom components** will be referenced by name when creating the template config for a user task.
**Custom validators** will be referenced by name (`customValidator`) in the template config panel in the validators section of each generated form field.
```typescript.tsx
import { FlxProcessRenderer } from '@flowx/react-sdk';
export function MyFlxContainer() {
return <FlxProcessRenderer
apiUrl={'your API url'}
language={...}
authToken={...}
processName={...}
processStartData={...}
processApiPath={...}
themeId="12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
components={{ MyCustomComponentIdentifier: MyCustomComponent }}
validators={{ customValidator: (...params: string[]) => (v: string) => v === '4.5'}}
staticAssetsPath={...}
locale="en-US"
language="en"
projectInfo={{
projectId: ...
}}
/>
}
```
The entry point of the library is the `<FlxProcessRenderer />` component. A list of accepted inputs is found below:
```
<FlxProcessRenderer
apiUrl={apiUrl}
language={language}
authToken={authToken}
processName={processName}
processStartData={processStartData}
processApiPath={apiPath}

## Starting a process
### Prerequisites
* **Process Name**: You need to know the name of the process you want to start. This name is used to identify the process in the system.
* **FlowX Project UUID**: You need the UUID of the FlowX Project that contains the process you want to start. This UUID is used to identify the project in the system.
* **Locale**: You can specify the locale of the process to apply date, currency, and number formatting to data model values.
* **Language**: You can specify the language used to localize the enumerations inside the application.
### Getting the project UUID
The project UUID can be obtained from the FlowX Dashboard. Navigate to the Projects section and select the project you want to start a process in. The UUID can be copied from the project actions popover.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/copy_uuid_application.png)
### Getting the process name
The process name can be obtained from the FlowX Designer. Navigate to the process you want to start and copy the process name from the breadcrumbs.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/copy_process_name.png)
### Initializing the process renderer
To start a process, you need to initialize the `FlxProcessRenderer` component in your application. The component accepts various props that define the process to start, the theme to use, and other configuration options.
```typescript.tsx
import { FlxProcessRenderer } from '@flowx/react-sdk';
export function MyFlxContainer() {
return <FlxProcessRenderer
{...props}
locale="en-US"
language="en"
processName={processName}
projectInfo={{ projectId }}
/>
}
```
## Custom components
Custom components will be hydrated with data through the data input prop which must be defined in the custom component.
Custom components will be provided through the `components` parameter to the `<FlxProcessRenderer />` component.
<Warning>
The object keys passed in the `components` prop **MUST** match the custom component names defined in the FlowX process.
</Warning>
<Check>
Component data defined through an `inputKey` is available under `data` -> `data`
</Check>
<Check>
Component actions are always found under `data` -> `actionsFn` key.
</Check>
```typescript.tsx
export const MyCustomComponent = ( {data }) => {...}
```
```typescript
# data object example
data: {
data: {
input1: ''
},
actionsFn: {
action_one: () => void;
action_two: () => void; }
}
```
To add a custom component in the template config tree, we need to know its unique identifier and the data it should receive from the process model.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui_designer_custom.png)
The properties that can be configured are as follows:
* **Identifier** - This enables the custom component to be displayed within the component hierarchy and determines the actions available for the component.
* **Input keys** - These are used to specify the pathway to the process data that components will utilize to receive their information.
* [**UI Actions**](../../4.5.0/docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-actions) - actions defined here will be made available to the custom component
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui_designer_custom_settings.png#center)
</Frame>
### Prerequisites (before creation)
* **React Knowledge**: You should have a good understanding of React, as custom components are created and imported using React.
* **Development Environment**: Set up a development environment for React development, including Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
* **Component Identifier**: You need a unique identifier for your custom component. This identifier is used for referencing the component within the application.
### Creating a custom component
To create a Custom Component in React, follow these steps:
1. Create a new React component.
2. Implement the necessary HTML structure, TypeScript logic, and SCSS styling to define the appearance and behavior of your custom component.
### Importing the component
After creating the Custom Component, you need to import it into your application.
In your `<FlxProcessRenderer />` component, add the following property:
```tsx
<FlxProcessRenderer
{...otherProps}
components={{ MyCustomComponentIdentifier: MyCustomComponent }}
/>
```
### Using the custom component
Once your Custom Component is declared, you can use it for configuration within your application.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/loader_component.gif)
### Data input and actions
The Custom Component accepts input data from processes and can also include actions extracted from a process. These inputs and actions allow you to configure and interact with the component dynamically.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/cst_input_data.png)
### Extracting data from processes
There are multiple ways to extract data from processes to use within your Custom Component. You can utilize the data provided by the process or map actions from the BPMN process to Angular actions within your component.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/cst_loader_input.png)
</Frame>
<Warning>
Make sure that the React actions that you declare match the names of the process actions.
</Warning>
### Styling with CSS
To apply CSS classes to UI elements within your Custom Component, you first need to identify the UI element identifiers within your component's HTML structure. Once identified, you can apply defined CSS classes to style these elements as desired.
Example:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/Screenshot%202023-10-10%20at%2012.29.51.png)
</Frame>
### Additional considerations
* **Naming Conventions**: Be consistent with naming conventions for components, identifiers, and actions. Ensure that Angular actions match the names of process actions as mentioned in the documentation.
* **Component Hierarchy**: Understand how the component fits into the overall component hierarchy of your application. This will help determine where the component is displayed and what actions are available for it.
* **Documentation and Testing**: Document your custom component thoroughly for future reference. Additionally, testing is crucial to ensure that the component behaves as expected in various scenarios.
* **Security**: If your custom component interacts with sensitive data or performs critical actions, consider security measures to protect the application from potential vulnerabilities.
* **Integration with FLOWX Designer**: Ensure that your custom component integrates seamlessly with FLOWX Designer, as it is part of the application's process modeling capabilities.
## Custom validators
You may also define custom validators in your FlowX processes and pass their implementation through the `validators` prop of the `<FlxProcessRenderer />` component.
The validators are then processed and piped through the popular [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register/) library, taking into account how the error messages are defined in your process.
A validator must have the following type:
```typescript
const customValidator = (...params: string[]) => (v: any) => boolean | Promise<boolean>
```
<Warning>
The object keys passed in the `validators` prop **MUST** match the custom validator names defined in the FlowX process.
</Warning>
## Custom CSS
The renderer SDK allows you to pass custom CSS classes on any component inside the process. These classes are then applied to the component's root element.
To add a CSS custom class to a component, you need to define the class in the process designer by navigating to the styles tab of the component, expanding the Advanced accordion and writing down the CSS class.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/add_css_class.gif)
<Warning>
The classes will be applied last on the element, so they will override the classes already defined on the element.
</Warning>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/4.5/react/css_class_inspector.png)
## Storybook
Below you will find a Storybook which will demonstrate how components behave under different states, props, and conditions, it allows you to preview and interact with individual UI components in isolation, without the need for a full-fledged application:

# SDKs overview
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/sdks/sdks-overview
FLOWX.AI provides web and native mobile SDKs. These SDKs enable developers to create applications that can be displayed in a browser, embedded in an internet banking interface, or in a mobile banking app. The SDKs automatically generate the user interface (UI) based on the business process and data points created by a business analyst, reducing the need for UX/UI expertise.
SDKs are used in the Angular, React, iOS, and Android applications to render the process screens and orchestrate the custom components.

# IAM solution
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/access-management/access-management-overview
Identity and access management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies and technologies that facilitates the management of electronic or digital identities. With an IAM framework in place, you can control user access to critical information/components within an organization.
## What is an Identity Provider (IdP)?
The IdP, Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), Privileged Identity/Access Management (PIM/PAM), Multi-factor/Two-factor Authentication (MFA/2FA), and numerous other subcategories are included in the IAM category.
IdP is a subset of an IAM solution that is dedicated to handling fundamental user IDs. The IdP serves as the authoritative source for defining and confirming user identities.
The IdP can be considered maybe the most important subcategory of the IAM field because it often lays the foundation of an organization's overall identity management infrastructure. In fact, other IAM categories and solutions, such as [IDaaS](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/identity-as-a-service-idaas), PIM/PAM, MFA/2FA, and others are often layered on top of the core IdP and serve to federate core user identities from the IdP to various endpoints. Therefore, your choice in IdP will have a profound influence on your overall IAM architecture.
<Info>
We recommend **Keycloak**, a component that allows you to create users and store credentials. It can be also used for authorization - defining groups, and assigning roles to users.
Every communication that comes from a consumer application, goes through a public entry point (API Gateway). To communicate with this component, the consumer application tries to start a process and the public entry point will check for authentication (Keycloak will send you a token) and the entry point validates it.
</Info>
## Configuring access rights
Granular access rights can be configured for restricting access to the FLOWX.AI components and their features or to define allowed actions for each type of user. Access rights are based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity provider management solution.
<Info>
To configure the roles for the users, they need to be added first to an identity provider (IdP) solution. **The access rights-related configuration needs to be set up for each microservice**. Default options are preconfigured. They can be overwritten using environment variables.

# Application manager access rights
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/access-management/app-manager-access-rights
Granular access rights can be configured for restricting access to the Application-manager component.
The **Application Manager** component provides granular access rights, allowing users to perform various actions depending on their assigned roles and the configured scopes.
<Info>
These access rights are also used by to the runtime-manager microservice.

### Configuring access
To define or adjust access for these roles, use the following format in your environment variables:
```plaintext
SECURITY_ACCESSAUTHORIZATIONS_<AUTHORIZATIONNAME>_SCOPES_<SCOPENAME>_ROLESALLOWED: NEEDED_ROLE_NAMES
```
<Info>
Roles must be defined in your identity provider (e.g., Keycloak, RH-SSO, Entra or any compatible provider).
</Info>
Custom roles can be configured as needed, and multiple roles can be assigned to each scope.
# Admin access rights

Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring a minimal Keycloak setup to manage users, roles, and applications efficiently.
We will walk you through configuring a minimal Keycloak setup to efficiently manage users, roles, and applications. Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution that makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no coding.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
* Keycloak installed
* Administrative access to the Keycloak server
* Basic understanding of IAM concepts
<Info>
Recommended keycloak version: **22.x**
</Info>
## Recommended Keycloak setup
To configure a minimal required Keycloak setup, in this guide we will covere the following steps:
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new realm" href="#creating-a-new-realm">
Define available roles and realm-level roles assigned to new users.
</Step>
<Step title="Create/import user roles and groups" href="#creatingimporting-user-groups-and-roles" />
<Step title="Create new users" href="#creating-new-users" />
<Step title="Add clients" href="#adding-clients">
Configure the client authentication, valid redirect URIs, and enable the necessary flows.
</Step>
<Step title="Add mappers" href="#adding-protocol-mappers" />
<Step title="Add service accounts" href="#adding-service-accounts">
Set up **admin**, **task management**, **process engine** and **scheduler** service accounts.
</Step>
</Steps>
Before starting, if you need further information or a broader understanding of Keycloak, refer to the official Keycloak documentation:
<Card title="Keycloak documentation" href="https://www.keycloak.org/documentation" icon="link" />
## Creating a new realm
A realm is a space where you manage objects, including users, applications, roles, and groups. Creating a new realm is the first step in setting up Keycloak. Follow the steps below to create a new realm in Keycloak:
<Steps>
<Step title="Log in to the Keycloak Admin Console">
Log in to the Keycloak Admin Console using the appropriate URL for your environment (e.g., QA, development, production).
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/iam1.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Create Realm">
In the top left corner dropdown menu, click **Create Realm**. If you are logged in to the master realm, this dropdown menu lists all the realms created.
<Info>
If you are logged in to the master realm, this dropdown menu lists all the realms created.

## Adding protocol mappers
Protocol mappers in Keycloak allow you to transform tokens and documents, enabling actions such as mapping user data into protocol claims and modifying requests between clients and the authentication server. This provides greater customization and control over the information contained in tokens and exchanged during authentication processes.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/keycloak_11.png)
</Frame>
To enhance your clients' functionality, add the following common mappers:
* [Group Membership mapper ](#group-membership-mapper) (`realm-groups`)
* Maps user groups to the authorization token.
* [User Attribute mapper](#user-attribute-mapper) (`business filter mapper`)
* Maps custom attributes, for example, mapping the [businessFilters ](/4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/business-filters) list, to the token claim.
* [User Realm role](#user-realm-role) (`realm-roles`)
* Maps a user's realm role to a token claim.
<Info>
The mappers we use can also be configured to control the data returned by the `/userinfo` endpoint, in addition to being included in tokens. This capability is a feature that not all Identity Providers (IDPs) support.
</Info>
By incorporating these mappers, you can further customize and enrich the information contained within your tokens, ensuring they carry the necessary data for your applications.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3. Token and API Permissions">
* Token Configuration includes defining claims (e.g., `email`, `groups`) for use in JWTs, which are used for secure identity validation across services.
* API Permissions are managed using Microsoft Graph, which governs access to resources like user profiles and groups within FlowX.AI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="4. Custom Attributes">
Custom attribute extensions (e.g., `businessFilter`) allow organizations to apply additional filters or metadata to user and group profiles, configured and managed using Microsoft Graph CLI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="5. Helm Chart Configuration">
* Helm charts provide a structured setup for deploying FlowX.AI applications in containerized environments.
* Key values such as `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` are configured to support authentication and secure access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="6. Example JWT Tokens">
JWT tokens are configured to carry user claims, roles, and custom attributes, ensuring that each token provides comprehensive identity details for FlowX.AI applications.

### Adding custom attributes
Using Microsoft Graph CLI, you can add custom attributes such as `businessFilter`.
<Tip>
For more information about Microsoft Graph CLI, check the following docs:
<Card title="Get started with Microsoft Graph CLI" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cli/get-started" icon="link" />
</Tip>
#### Prerequisites
* [Install the Microsoft Graph CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cli/installation?tabs=macos).
#### Create an attribute extension property
Create an Attribute Extension Property on the flowx-api app registration:
1. Log in to Microsoft Graph CLI with the necessary permissions:
```bash
$ mgc login --scopes Directory.Read.All
```
<Tip>
You can add additional permissions by repeating the mgc login command with the new permission scopes.
</Tip>
2. Create the attribute extension property by running the following command. Replace `<application_object_id>` with the object ID of your flowx-api application:
```bash
$ mgc applications extension-properties create --application-id <application_object_id> --body '
{
"dataType": "String",
"name": "businessFilter",
"targetObjects": [
"User", "Group"
]
}'
```
#### Retrieve the attribute extension name
To confirm the attribute extension name, use the command below. This will output the exact name of the created extension property.
```bash
$ mgc applications extension-properties list --application-id <application_object_id> --select name
```
Example output:
```json
{
"@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#applications(\u0027<application_object_id>\u0027)/extensionProperties(name)",
"value": [
{
"name": "extension_ec959542898b42bcb6922e7d3f9df282_businessFilter"
}
]
}
```
#### Configure token claim
1. Go to the **flowx-api** app registration in the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to **Token configuration**.
3. Click **Add optional claim**.
* Select **Token type** as **Access**.
* Check the box for `extn.businessFilter`.
4. Click Add to save the changes.
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/entra/Screenshot%202024-11-04%20at%2019.31.05.png)
</Frame>
#### Assign attribute extension to a user
1. Log in with the required permissions to modify user attributes:
```bash
$ mgc login --scopes User.ReadWrite.All
```
2. Assign the `businessFilter` attribute to a user by running the command below. Replace `<user_object_id>` with the user's `object ID`:
```bash
$ mgc users patch --user-id <user_object_id> --body '
{
"extension_ec959542898b42bcb6922e7d3f9df282_businessFilter": "docs"
}'
```
#### Assign attribute extension to a group
Follow similar steps to assign the `businessFilter` attribute to a group. Replace `<group_object_id>` with the group’s `object ID` and use the following command:
1. Log in with the required permissions to modify group attributes:
```bash
$ mgc login --scopes User.ReadWrite.All
```
2. Assign the custom attribute by  the command below, replacing `<user_object_id>` with the user’s object ID. The businessFilter attribute is set to "docs" in this example.
```bash
$ mgc groups patch --group-id <group_object_id> --body '
{
"extension_ec959542898b42bcb6922e7d3f9df282_businessFilter": "docs"
}'
```
***
## Example JWT token for user
To verify that the custom attributes and roles have been correctly applied, you can inspect a sample JWT token issued to a user. This token will include standard claims along with any custom attributes and roles configured in your Entra ID setup.
### Steps to retrieve a JWT token
1. **Login to the FlowX.AI Application**\
Log in to the FlowX.AI application as the user for whom the JWT token needs to be inspected.
2. **Retrieve the JWT Token**\
After logging in, retrieve the JWT token by one of the following methods:
* Using browser developer tools to inspect network requests (look for requests with an `Authorization` header).
* Accessing a token endpoint if available, using a tool like Postman.
3. **Decode the JWT Token**\
Use a JWT decoding tool, such as [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/), to decode and inspect the token.
***
### Sample JWT token structure
Below is an example JWT token structure that includes key claims, custom attributes, and roles:

# FlowX Admin setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/admin-setup-guide
The FlowX.AI Admin microservice manages process-related entities and provides the REST API used by the FlowX.AI Designer. The processes defined here will be handled by the FlowX.AI Engine. The Admin microservice uses most of the same resources as the FlowX.AI Engine.
## Infrastructure prerequisites
Before setting up the Admin microservice, ensure the following components are properly set up:
* **Database Instance**: The Admin microservice connects to the same database as the FlowX.AI Engine.
## Dependencies
Ensure the following dependencies are met:
* **[Database](#database-configuration)**: Properly configured database instance.
* **[Datasource](#datasource-configuration)**: Configuration details for connecting to the database where also the FlowX.Ai Engine is connected.
* **Kafka cluster**: If you intend to use the [**FlowX.AI Audit**](../../4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/audit) functionality, ensure that the backend microservice can connect to the Kafka cluster. When connected to Kafka, it sends details about all database transactions to a configured Kafka topic.
## Datasource configuration
To store process definitions the Admin microservice connects to the same Postgres / Oracle database as the Engine. Make sure to set the needed database connection details.
The following configuration details need to be added using environment variables:
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`: This environment variable is used to specify the URL of the database that the Admin microservice and Engine connect to. The URL typically includes the necessary information to connect to the database server, such as the host, port, and database name. It follows the format of the database's JDBC URL, which is specific to the type of database being used (e.g., PostgreSQL or Oracle).
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`: This environment variable sets the username that the Admin microservice and Engine used to authenticate themselves when connecting to the database. The username is used to identify the user account that has access to the specified database.
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`: This environment variable specifies the password associated with the username provided in the `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` variable. The password is used to authenticate the user and grant access to the database.
<Warning>
You will need to make sure that the user, password, connection link and db name are configured correctly, otherwise, you will receive errors at start time.
</Warning>
<Info>
The database schema is managed by a [liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) script provided with the Engine.
</Info>
### MongoDB configuration
The Admin microservice also connects to a MongoDB database instance for additional data management. Configure the MongoDB connection with the following environment variables:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI` - URI for connecting to the Admin MongoDB instance
* Format: `mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@<host1>,<host2>,<arbiter-host>:<port>/${DB_NAME}?retryWrites=false`
* `DB_USERNAME`: `admin`.
* `DB_PASSWORD`: DB password.
* `DB_NAME`: `admin`.
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE` - Specifies the storage type used for the Runtime MongoDB instance (Azure environments only)
* **Possible Values:** `mongodb`, `cosmosdb`
* **Default Value:** `mongodb`
<Info>
Ensure that the MongoDB configuration is compatible with the same database requirements as the FlowX.AI Engine, especially if sharing database instances.
</Info>
## Kafka configuration
**Kafka** is used for saving audit logs, using scheduled timer events, managing platform component versions, and sending updates for start timer events. Both producers and consumers may need to be configured depending on the application's functionality. The environment variables that need to be set are:
### General configuration
* `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - the Kafka bootstrap servers URL
* **Default**: `localhost:9092`
* `KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL` - protocol used for Kafka communication
* **Default**: `"PLAINTEXT"`
* `KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES` - maximum size for Kafka messages
* **Default**: `52428800` (50MB)
### Topic environment variables
#### Audit topics
* **Audit Output**:
* **Environment variable**: `KAFKA_TOPIC_AUDIT_OUT`
* **Pattern**: `${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}core${dot}trigger${dot}save${dot}audit${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}`
* **Purpose**: For sending audit-related events.
* **Example**: `ai.flowx.core.trigger.save.audit.v1`
#### Platform topics
* **Components Versions Caching**:
* **Environment variable**: `KAFKA_TOPIC_PLATFORM_COMPONENTS_VERSIONS_IN`
* **Pattern**: `${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}core${dot}trigger${dot}platform${dot}versions${dot}caching${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}`
* **Purpose**: For caching platform component versions.
* **Example**: `ai.flowx.core.trigger.platform.versions.caching.v1`
#### Events Gateway topics
* **Commands Message Output**:
* **Environment variable**: `KAFKA_TOPIC_EVENTS_GATEWAY_OUT_MESSAGE`
* **Pattern**: `${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}eventsgateway${dot}process${dot}commands${dot}message${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}`
* **Purpose**: For sending process command messages through the events gateway.
* **Example**: `ai.flowx.eventsgateway.process.commands.message.v1`
#### Build topics
* **Start Timer Events Updates**:
* **Environment variable**: `KAFKA_TOPIC_BUILD_START_TIMER_EVENTS_OUT_UPDATES`
* **Pattern**: `${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}build${dot}start${dash}timer${dash}events${dot}updates${dot}in${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}`
* **Purpose**: Sends updates from the admin to the application manager about start timer events, specifically if they have been edited or deleted.
* **Example**: `ai.flowx.build.start-timer-events.updates.in.v1`
## Redis configuration
The following values should be set with the corresponding Redis-related values:
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST`
* `SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD`
## Logging
The following environment variables could be set in order to control log levels:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT` - root Spring Boot microservice logs
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP` - app level logs
## Authorization & access roles
The following variables need to be set in order to connect to the identity management platform:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`
A specific service account should be configured in the OpenID provider to allow the Admin microservice to access realm-specific data. It can be configured using the following environment variables:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID` - the openid service account username
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` - the openid service account client secret
Configuration needed to clear the offline sessions of a user session from the identity provider solution:
* `FLOWX_AUTHENTICATE_CLIENTID`
<Card title="Configuring access rights for admin" href="./access-management/configuring-access-rights-for-admin" />
## Elasticsearch
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_URIS`
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_DISABLESSL`
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_SETTINGS_NAME`
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_USERNAME`
* `SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_PASSWORD`
## Undo/redo actions
```yaml
flowx:
undo-redo:
ttl: 6000000  # Redis TTL for undoable actions by user+nodeid (in seconds)
cleanup:
cronExpression: "0 2 * * * *"  # Every day at 2am
days: 2  # Items marked as deleted will be permanently removed if older than this number of days
```
# FlowX Advancing Controller setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/advancing-controller-setup-guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you configure and deploy the Advancing Controller effectively.
## Infrastructure prerequisites
Before setting up the Advancing Controller, ensure the following components are properly set up:
* **FlowX.AI Engine Deployment**: The Advancing Controller depends on the FlowX Engine and must be deployed in the same environment. Refer to the FlowX Engine [**setup guide**](./flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup) for more information on setting up the Engine.
* **Database Instance**: The Advancing Controller uses a PostgreSQL or OracleDB instance as its database.
## Dependencies
Ensure the following dependencies are met:
* [Database](#database-configuration): Properly configured database instance.
* [Datasource](#configuring-datasource): Configuration details for connecting to the database.
* [FlowX.AI Engine](./flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup): Must be set up and running. Refer to the FlowX Engine setup guide.
### Database compatibility
The Advancing Controller supports both PostgreSQL and OracleDB databases. However, the FlowX.AI Engine and the Advancing Controller must be configured to use the same type of database at any given time. The FlowX.AI Engine employs two databases: one shared with the FlowX.AI Admin microservice for process metadata and instances, and the other dedicated to advancement.
<Warning>
Mixing PostgreSQL and OracleDB is not supported; both databases must be of the same type.
</Warning>
## Database configuration
### PostgreSQL
A basic PostgreSQL configuration for Advancing:
```yaml
postgresql:
enabled: true
postgresqlUsername: "postgres"
postgresqlPassword: ""
postgresqlDatabase: "advancing"
existingSecret: "postgresql-generic"
postgresqlMaxConnections: 200
persistence:
enabled: true
storageClass: standard-rwo
size: 20Gi
resources:
limits:
cpu: 1000m
memory: 1024Mi
requests:
memory: 256Mi
cpu: 100m
metrics:
enabled: true
serviceMonitor:
enabled: false
prometheusRule:
enabled: false
primary:
nodeSelector:
preemptible: "false"
```
<Warning>
If the parallel advancing configuration already exists, you must reset the 'advancing' database by executing the SQL command `DROP DATABASE advancing;`. Once the database has been dropped, the Liquibase script will automatically re-enable it.
</Warning>
## Configuration
The Advancing Controller uses a PostgreSQL or an Oracle database as a dependency.
* Ensure that the user, password, connection link, and database name are correctly configured. If these details are not configured correctly, errors will occur at startup.
* The datasource is configured automatically via a Liquibase script inside the engine. All updates will include migration scripts.
### Configuring datasource
If you need to change the datasource configuration detail, you can use the following environment variables:
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`: Environment variable used to configure a data source URL for a Spring application. It typically contains the JDBC driver name, the server name, port number, and database name.
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`: Environment variable used to set the username for the database connection. This can be used to connect to a database instance.
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`: Environment variable used to store the password for the database connection. This can be used to secure access to the database and ensure that only authorized users have access to the data.
* `SPRING_JPA_DATABASE`: Specifies the type of database that the Spring application should connect to (accepted values: `oracle` or `postgresql`).
* `SPRING_JPA_PROPERTIES_HIBERNATE_DEFAULTSCHEMA` (❗️only for Oracle DBs): Specifies the default schema to use for the database (default value: `public`).
<Info>
It's important to keep in mind that the Advancing Controller is tightly integrated with the FlowX.AI Engine. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that both the Engine and the Advancing Controller are configured correctly and are in sync.
</Info>
# Application Manager setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/application-manager
The Application Manager is a backend microservice for managing FlowX applications, libraries, versions, manifests, configurations, and builds. This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the service and configuring its components through environment variables.
The Application Manager is a backend microservice in FlowX.AI that:
✅ Manages FlowX applications, versions, manifests, and configurations.\
✅ Acts as a proxy for front-end resource requests.

To control the log levels, set the following environment variables:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT` - the log level for the root Spring Boot microservice logs
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP` - the log level for app-level logs
<Warning>
Make sure to overwrite the placeholders (where needed) with the appropriate values before starting the service.
</Warning>
# FlowX CMS setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/cms-setup
The CMS service is a microservice designed for managing taxonomies and content inside an application. Delivered as a Docker image, it simplifies content editing and analysis. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the service and configuring it to suit your needs.
Ensure the following infrastructure components are available before starting the CMS service:
* **Docker Engine**: Version 17.06 or higher.
* **MongoDB**: Version 4.4 or higher for storing taxonomies and content.
* **Redis**: Version 6.0 or higher.
* **Kafka**: Version 2.8 or higher.
* **Elasticsearch**: Version 7.11.0 or higher.
<Info>
The service is pre-configured with most default values. However, some environment variables require customization during setup.
</Info>
## Dependencies overview
* [**MongoDB instance**](#mongodb-database)
* [**Authorization & access roles**](#configuring-authorization-access-roles)
* [**Redis**](#configuring-redis)
* [**Kafka**](#configuring-kafka)
## Configuration
### Set application defaults
Define the default application name for retrieving content:
```yaml
application:
defaultApplication: ${DEFAULT_APPLICATION:flowx}
```
<Info>
If this configuration is not provided, the default value will be set to `flowx`.
</Info>
### Configuring authorization & access roles
Connect the CMS to an OAuth 2.0 identity management platform by setting the following variables:
* **`SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`**: Specifies the base URL for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, which handles authentication and token issuance.
* **`SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`**: Unique identifier for the client application. Used during authentication with the OAuth 2.0 server.
* **`SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET`**: Secret key to authenticate requests from the client application.
* **`SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`**: Defines the realm name for OAuth 2.0 provider authentication in Spring Security.
For detailed role and access configuration, refer to:
<Card title="FlowX CMS access rights" href="./access-management/configuring-access-rights-for-cms" icon="file" />
### Configuring MongoDB
The CMS requires MongoDB for taxonomy and content storage. Configure MongoDB with the following variables:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI`: URI for connecting to the CMS MongoDB instance.
* Format: `mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@<host1>,<host2>,<arbiter-host>:<port>/${DB_NAME}?retryWrites=false`
* `DB_USERNAME` : `cms-core`
* `DB_NAME`: `cms-core`
* `DB_PASSWORD`: DB password.
* `MONGOCK_TRANSACTIONENABLED`: Enables or disables transactions in MongoDB for compatibility with the Mongock library.
* **Default Value:** `false` (Set it to `false` to support successful migrations).
* **Note:** Set to `false` due to known issues with transactions in MongoDB version 5.
#### Configuring MongoDB (runtime database - additional data)
In addition to core storage, CMS also connects to a Runtime MongoDB instance for operational data. Configure using these variables:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI` - URI for connecting to the Runtime MongoDB instance (`app-runtime`)
* Format: `mongodb://${RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME}:${RUNTIME_DB_PASSWORD}@<host1>,<host2>,<arbiter-host>:<port>/${RUNTIME_DB_NAME}?retryWrites=false`
* `RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME`: `app-runtime`
* `RUNTIME_DB_NAME`: `app-runtime`
* `RUNTIME_DB_PASSWORD`: DB password.
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_STORAGE` - Specifies the storage type used for the Runtime MongoDB instance (Azure environments only)
* **Possible Values:** `mongodb`, `cosmosdb`
* **Default Value:** `mongodb`
### Configuring Redis
<Info>
The service can use the [**Redis component**](./setup-guides-overview#redis-configuration) already deployed for the engine.
</Info>
The following values should be set with the corresponding Redis-related values:
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST`: Hostname or IP address of the Redis server.
* `SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD`: Authentication password for the Redis server.
* `REDIS_TTL`: Used to specify the maximum time-to-live (TTL) for a key in Redis, it is used to set a limit on how long a key can exist before it is automatically expired (Redis will delete the key after the specified TTL has expired).
All the data produced by the service will be stored in Redis under a specific key. The name of the key can be configured using the environment variable:
### Configuring Kafka
To configure the Kafka server, you need to set the following environment variables:
* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Address of the Kafka server (host:port).
* `SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID`: Defines the Kafka consumer group.
* `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS`: Number of Kafka consumer threads.
* `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL`: Retry interval after an authorization exception.
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_AUDIT_OUT`: Topic for audit logs.
#### Request content topics
| Environment Variable                | Default FLOWX.AI value (Customizable)                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_REQUEST\_CONTENT\_IN  | ai.flowx.dev.plugin.cms.trigger.retrieve.content.v1                |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_REQUEST\_CONTENT\_OUT | ai.flowx.dev.engine.receive.plugin.cms.retrieve.content.results.v1 |
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_REQUEST_CONTENT_IN`: This variable defines the topic used by the CMS to listen for incoming content retrieval requests.
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_REQUEST_CONTENT_OUT`: This variable defines the topic where the CMS sends the results of content retrieval requests back to the FlowX Engine.
Each action available in the service corresponds to a Kafka event. A separate Kafka topic must be configured for each use case.
<Tip>
It is important to note that all the actions that start with a configured pattern will be consumed by the engine.
</Tip>
### Configuring logging
To control the log levels, the following environment variables can be set:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT`: Log level for the root service logs.
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP`: Log level for application-specific logs.
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_MONGO_DRIVER`: Log level for the MongoDB driver.
### Configuring file storage
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SERVER_URL`: URL of the S3 server for file storage.

* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PUBLIC_URL`: Public URL for accessing files.
#### Private storage configuration
Private CMS to securely store uploaded documents and AI-generated documents, ensuring they are accessible only via authenticated endpoints. This CMS will support AI services and workflows while maintaining strict access controls.
<Info>
Private CMS ensures secure file storage by keeping documents hidden from the Media Library and accessible only through authenticated endpoints with access token permissions. Files can be retrieved using tags (e.g., ai\_document, ref:UUID\_doc) and are excluded from application builds as they aren't needed at runtime.
</Info>
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_SERVER_URL`: This environment variable specifies the URL of the S3 server used for private file storage.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET_NAME`: This environment variable specifies the name of the S3 bucket dedicated to private file storage.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_CREATE_BUCKET`: This environment variable indicates whether the private S3 bucket should be created if it does not already exist. It can be set to true or false.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_ACCESS_KEY`: This environment variable holds the access key used to authenticate to the S3 server for private file storage.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY`: This environment variable holds the secret key used to authenticate to the S3 server for private file storage.
### Configuring the maximum file size for uploads
To set the maximum file size for uploads through the CMS service (e.g., the Media Library), you can adjust the following environment variables:
* `SPRING_SERVLET_MULTIPART_MAX_FILE_SIZE: ${MULTIPART_MAX_FILE_SIZE:50MB}`: Defines the maximum file size allowed for uploads. Default is 50 MB.
* `SPRING_SERVLET_MULTIPART_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE: ${MULTIPART_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE:50MB}`: Defines the maximum request size allowed for uploads. Default is 50 MB.
<Warning>
Please note that raising the file size to a high limit may increase vulnerability to potential attacks. Consider carefully before making this change.
</Warning>
### Configuring application management
The FlowX helm chart provides a management service with the necessary parameters to integrate with the Prometheus operator. However, this integration is disabled by default.
#### Prometheus metrics export configuration
<Warning>
Old configuration from \< v4.1 releases (will be deprecated in v4.5):
* `MANAGEMENT_METRICS_EXPORT_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`: Enables or disables Prometheus metrics export.
</Warning>
<Info>
New configuration, starting from v4.1 release, available below. Note that this setup is backwards compatible, it does not affect the configuration from v3.4.x. The configuration files will still work until v4.5 release.
</Info>

# Data-sync job setup guide
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/data-sync
This guide provides essential environment variables for configuring the Data-Sync Job. You should use these environment variables to set up and run the Job in your Kubernetes environment.
# Overview
The Data-Sync Job is designed to synchronize and transfer data across multiple databases, ensuring data consistency and up-to-date information across all connected systems.
It operates by connecting to multiple databases, retrieves data, and synchronizes changes across them. The job logs its actions and can be scheduled to run regularly, keeping all databases in sync and up-to-date.
# Data-sync job setup guide
This guide details the essential environment variables required to configure and run the Data-Sync Job for synchronizing data across various databases.
## Required environment variables
### Config profile
* `CONFIG_PROFILE` - This environment variable must be set explicitly and exactly to ensure that no unintended profiles are loaded by mistake. The value of this variable should represent a minimal configuration state, relying only on defaults specified in the `application.properties` file of the application.
Example:
```yaml
- name: CONFIG_PROFILE
value: k8stemplate_v2,kafka-auth
```
### Skipping services for data-sync
If your deployment doesn't have certain plugins or other microservices installed, you should configure data-sync to skip migrations for those:
* `FLOWX_SKIPPEDRESOURCESERVICES` - Comma-separated list of service names for which data-sync should skip running migrations.
Example:
```yaml
# Skip data-sync for document and notification plugins
- name: FLOWX_SKIPPEDRESOURCESERVICES
value: "document-plugin,notification-plugin"
```
<Warning>
Avoid blank spaces in the value of the `FLOWX_SKIPPEDRESOURCESERVICES` variable.
</Warning>
This prevents data-sync from failing when trying to synchronize databases for services that aren't installed in your environment.
<Info>
Available services datasources are:
* `scheduler-core`: scheduler
* `cms-core`: cms
* `task-management-plugin`: task-manager

# FlowX Designer setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/designer-setup-guide
To set up FlowX Designer in your environment, follow this guide.
## Prerequisites Management
### NGINX
For optimal operation the FlowX.AI Designer should use a separate [NGINX](../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-nginx) load balancer from the **FlowX Engine**. This routing mechanism handles API calls from the [SPA](./designer-setup-guide#for-configuring-the-spa) (single page application) to the backend service, to the engine and to various plugins.
Here's an example/suggestion of an NGINX setup:
#### For routing calls to plugins:
```jsx
metadata:
annotations:
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:80,http://localhost:8080"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
name: flowx-admin-plugins-subpaths
spec:
rules:
- host: {{host}}
http:
paths:
- path: /notification(/|$)(.*)
backend:
serviceName: notification
servicePort: 80
- path: /document(/|$)(.*)
backend:
serviceName: document
servicePort: 80
tls:
- hosts:
- {{host}}
secretName: {{tls secret}}
```
#### For routing calls to the engine
Three different configurations are needed:
1. For viewing the current instances of processes running in the Engine:
```jsx
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
annotations:
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /api/instances/$2
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:80,http://localhost:8080"
name: flowx-admin-engine-instances
spec:
rules:
- host: {{host}}
http:
paths:
- path: /api/instances(/|$)(.*)
backend:
serviceName: {{engine-service-name}}
servicePort: 80
```
2. For testing process definitions from the FLOWX Designer, route API calls and SSE communication to the Engine backend.
Setup for routing REST calls:
```jsx
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
annotations:
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /api/$2
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:80,http://localhost:8080"
name: flowx-admin-engine-rest-api
spec:
rules:
- host: {{host}}
http:
paths:
- path: /{{PROCESS_API_PATH}}/api(/|$)(.*)
backend:
serviceName: {{engine-service-name}}
servicePort: 80
```
Setup for routing SSE communication:
```jsx
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-headers: "<your_defaultCorsAllowHeaders_value>"
name: flowx-public-subpath-events-rewrite
spec:
rules:
- host: {{host}}
http:
paths:
- backend:
service:
name: events-gateway
port:
name: http
path: /api/events(/|$)(.*)
```
3. For accessing the REST API of the backend microservice
```jsx
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
annotations:
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "4m"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:80,http://localhost:8080"
name: flowx-admin-api
spec:
rules:
- host: {{host}}
http:
paths:
- path: /
backend:
serviceName: {{flowx-admin-service-name}}
servicePort: 80
tls:
- hosts:
- {{host}}
secretName: {{tls secret}}
```
#### For configuring the SPA
```jsx
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
annotations:
certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie
name: flowx-designer-spa
spec:
rules:
- host: {{host of web app}}
http:
paths:
- backend:
serviceName: {{flowx-designer-service-name}}
servicePort: 80
tls:
- hosts:
- {{host of web app}}
secretName: {{tls secret}}
```
## Steps to deploy Frontend app
The FlowX.AI Designer is an SPA application that is packaged in a docker image with `nginx:1.19.10`. The web application allows an authenticated user to administrate the FLOWX platform.
In order to configure the docker image you need to configure the next parameters:
```jsx
flowx-process-renderer:
env:
BASE_API_URL: {{the one configured as host in the nginx}}
PROCESS_API_PATH: {{something like /engine}}
KEYCLOAK_ISSUER: {{openid provider - ex: https://something/auth/realms/realmName}}
KEYCLOAK_REDIRECT_URI: {{url of the SPA}}
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID: {{client ID}}
STATIC_ASSETS_PATH: {{mediaLibrary.s3.publicUrl }}/{{env}}
```
# FlowX Events Gateway setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/events-gateway-setup
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the events-gateway service.
## Infrastructure prerequisites
Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that the following components have been set up:
* **Redis** - version 6.0 or higher
* **Kafka** - version 2.8 or higher
## Dependencies
* **Kafka** - used for event communication
* **Redis** - used for caching
## Configuration
### Configuring Kafka
Set the following Kafka-related configurations using environment variables:
* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - the address of the Kafka server, it should be in the format "host:port"
#### Groupd IDs
The configuration parameters "KAFKA\_CONSUMER\_GROUP\_ID\_\*" are used to set the consumer group name for Kafka consumers that consume messages from topics. Consumer groups in Kafka allow for parallel message processing by distributing the workload among multiple consumer instances. By configuring the consumer group ID, you can specify the logical grouping of consumers that work together to process messages from the same topic, enabling scalable and fault-tolerant message consumption in your Kafka application.
| Configuration Parameter                                      | Default value                | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID_PROCESS_ENGINE_COMMANDS_MESSAGE`    | `engine-commands-message`    | Consumer group ID for processing engine commands messages            |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID_PROCESS_ENGINE_COMMANDS_DISCONNECT` | `engine-commands-disconnect` | Consumer group ID for processing engine commands disconnect messages |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID_PROCESS_ENGINE_COMMANDS_CONNECT`    | `engine-commands-connect`    | Consumer group ID for processing engine commands connect messages    |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID_PROCESS_TASK_COMMANDS`              | `task-commands-message`      | Consumer group ID for processing task commands                       |
#### Threads
The configuration parameters "KAFKA\_CONSUMER\_THREADS\_\*" are utilized to specify the number of threads assigned to Kafka consumers for processing messages from topics. These parameters allow you to fine-tune the concurrency and parallelism of your Kafka consumer application, enabling efficient and scalable message consumption from Kafka topics.
| Configuration Parameter                                     | Default value | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_ENGINE_COMMANDS_MESSAGE`    | 10            | Number of threads for processing engine commands messages                                |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_ENGINE_COMMANDS_DISCONNECT` | 5             | Number of threads for processing engine commands disconnect messages                     |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_PROCESS_ENGINE_COMMANDS_CONNECT`    | 5             | Number of threads for processing engine commands connect messages                        |
| `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_TASK_COMMANDS`                      | 10            | Number of threads for task commands                                                      |
| `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL`                       | 10            | Interval between retries after an AuthorizationException is thrown by the Kafka consumer |
#### Kafka topics related to process instances
| Configuration Parameter                                     | Default value                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC_EVENTS_GATEWAY_PROCESS_INSTANCE_IN_MESSAGE`    | `ai.flowx.dev.eventsgateway.engine.commands.message.v1`    |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC_EVENTS_GATEWAY_PROCESS_INSTANCE_IN_DISCONNECT` | `ai.flowx.dev.eventsgateway.engine.commands.disconnect.v1` |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC_EVENTS_GATEWAY_PROCESS_INSTANCE_IN_CONNECT`    | `ai.flowx.dev.eventsgateway.engine.commands.connect.v1`    |
#### Kafka topics related to tasks
| Configuration Parameter                      | Default value                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC_EVENTS_GATEWAY_TASK_IN_MESSAGE` | `ai.flowx.eventsgateway.task.commands.message.v1` |
### Configuring authorization & access roles
Set the following environment variables to connect to the identity management platform:
| Configuration Parameter                | Description                             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`      | Base URL of the OAuth2 server           |
| `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`     | Client ID for OAuth2 authentication     |
| `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for OAuth2 authentication |
| `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`                | Realm for OAuth2 authentication         |
### Redis
The process engine sends the messages to the events-gateway, which is responsible for sending them to Redis.
| Configuration Parameter      | Description                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `SPRING_DATA_REDIS_HOST`     | Hostname of the Redis server |
| `SPRING_DATA_REDIS_PASSWORD` | Password for Redis server    |
| `SPRING_DATA_REDIS_PORT`     | Connect to the Redis server  |
#### Master replica
The events-gateway can be configured to communicate with Redis using the MASTER\_REPLICA replication mode by configuring the following property:
`spring.data.redis.sentinel.nodes: replica1, replica2, replica3`, etc...
Correspondent environment variable:
* `SPRING_DATA_REDIS_SENTINEL_NODES`
##### Example
```makefile
spring.redis.sentinel.nodes=host1:26379,host2:26379,host3:26379
```
In the above example, the Spring Boot application will connect to three Redis Sentinel nodes: host1:26379, host2:26379, and host3:26379.
The property value should be a comma-separated list of host:port pairs, where each pair represents the hostname or IP address and the port number of a Redis Sentinel node.
<Info>
By default, Redis is standalone, so the configuration with `redis-replicas` is optional for high load use cases.
</Info>
In the context of Spring Boot and Redis Sentinel integration, the `spring.redis.sentinel.nodes` property is used to specify the list of Redis Sentinel nodes that the Spring application should connect to. These nodes are responsible for monitoring and managing Redis instances.
### Events
This configuration helps manage how event data is stored and accessed in Redis.
| Configuration Parameter        | Default | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EVENTS_REDIS_FREQUENCYMILLIS` | 200     | Time interval (in milliseconds) between Redis queries by the events gateway to check for new messages |
| `EVENTS_REDIS_TTLHOURS`        | 4       | Sets the time-to-live for events in Redis to 4 hours                                                  |
### Configuring logging
The following environment variables could be set in order to control log levels:
| Configuration Parameter | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT`    | Logging level for the root Spring Boot microservice logs |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP`     | Logging level for the application-level logs             |
# Configuring access roles for processes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-access-roles-for-processes
## Access to a process definition
Setting up user role-based access on process definitions is done by configuring swimlanes on the process definition.
<Card title="Swimlanes" href="/4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/swimlanes" icon="file" />
By default, all process nodes belong to the same swimlane. If more swimlanes are needed, they can be edited in the process definition settings panel.
Swimlane role settings apply to the whole process, the process nodes or the actions to be performed on the nodes.
First, the desired user roles need to be configured in the identity provider solution and users must be assigned the correct roles.
<Tip>
You can use the **Access management** tab under **General Settings** to administrate all the roles.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/access_management_roles.png)
</Tip>
<Info>
To be able to access the roles defined in the identity provider solution, a [**service account**](../access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#process-engine-service-account) with appropriate permissions needs to be added in the identity provider. And the details of that service account [**need to be set up in the platform configuration**](../../setup-guides//designer-setup-guide#authorization--access-roles).
</Info>
The defined roles will then be available to be used in the process definition settings (**Permissions** tab) panel for configuring swimlane access.
A **Default** swimlane comes with two default permissions assigned based on a specific role.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/swimlane_default_roles.png)
* **execute** - the user will be able to start process instances and run actions on them
* **self-assign** - the user can assign a process instance to them and start working on it
<Info>
This is valid for **> 2.11.0** FLOWX.AI platform release.
</Info>
Other **Permissions** can be added manually, depending on the needs of the user. Some permissions are needed to be configured so you can use features inside [Task Management](/4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management/task-management-overview) plugin. Specific roles need to be assigned separately on a few available process operations. These are:
* **view** - the user will be able to view process instance data
* **assign** - user can assign tasks to other users (this operation is only accessible through the **Task management** plugin)
* **unassign** - user can unassign tasks from other users (this operation is only accessible through the **Task management** plugin)
* **hold** - user can mark the process instance as on hold (this operation is only accessible through the **Task management** plugin)
* **unhold** - user can mark the process instance as not on hold (this operation is only accessible through the **Task management** plugin)
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/process_permissions.png)
<Warning>
**\< 2.11.0 platform release** - if no role is configured on an operation, no restrictions will be applied.
</Warning>
## Configuration examples
<Info>
Valid for \< 2.11.0 release version.
</Info>
### Regular user
Below you can find an example of configuration of roles for a regular user:
![example configuration of roles for a regular user](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/regular_user_roles.png)
### Admin
Below you can find an example of configuration of roles for an admin user:
![example configuration of roles for an admin user](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/admin_user_roles.png)
<Warning>
Starting with [**2.11.0**](https://old-docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v2.11.0-august-2022/) release, specific roles are needed, otherwise, restrictions will be applied.
</Warning>
After setting up your preferred identity provider solution, you will need to add the desired access roles in the application configuration for the FLOWX Engine (using environment variables):
[Authorization & access roles](./engine-setup#authorization-and-access-roles)
## Restricting process instance access based on business filters
[Business filters](/4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/user-roles-management/business-filters)
Before they can be used in the process definition the business filter attributes need to be set in the identity management platform. They have to be configured as a list of filters and should be made available on the authorization token. Application users will also have to be assigned this value.
## Viewing processes instances
Active process instances and their related data can be viewed from the FLOWX Designer. A user needs to be assigned to a specific role in the identity provider solution to be able to view this information.
By default, this role is named `FLOWX_ROLE`, but its name can be changed from the application configuration of the Engine by setting the following environment variable:
`FLOWX_PROCESS_DEFAULTROLES`
When viewing process instance-related data, it can be configured whether to hide specific sensitive user data. This can be configured using the `FLOWX_DATA_ANONYMIZATION` environment variable.
## Starting processes
The`FLOWX_ROLE` is also used to grant permissions for starting processes.
## Access to REST API
To restrict API calls by user role, you will need to add the user roles in the application config:
```yaml
security:
pathAuthorizations:
-
path: "/api/**"
rolesAllowed: "ANY_AUTHENTICATED_USER" or "USER_ROLE_FROM_IDENTITY_PROVIDER"
```
# Configuring Elasticsearch indexing
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/elasticsearch-indexing
This section provides configuration steps for enabling process instance indexing using the Kafka transport strategy.
<Tip>
Before proceeding, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with Elasticsearch and its indexing process by referring to the Intro to Elasticsearch section.
</Tip>
<Card title="Intro to Elasticsearch" href="../../../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-elasticsearch" icon="file" />
## Configuration updates
To enable Kafka indexing strategy, the previous configuration parameter `flowx.use-elasticsearch` is being replaced. However, to ensure backward compatibility, it will still be preserved in the configuration. Below is an example of how to configure it:
```yaml
spring:
elasticsearch:
index-settings:
name: process_instance
shards: 1
replicas: 1
```
Instead of the removed configuration, a new configuration area has been added:
```yaml
flowx:
indexing:
enabled: true  // true | false - specifies if the indexing with Elasticsearch for the whole app is enabled or disabled.
processInstance:  // set of configurations for indexing process instances. Can be duplicated for other objects.
indexing-type: kafka  // no-indexing | http | kafka - the chosen indexing strategy.
index-name: process_instance  // the index name that is part of the search pattern.
shards: 1
replicas: 1
```
The `flowx.indexing.enabled` property determines whether indexing with Elasticsearch is enabled. When set to false or missing, no indexing will be performed for any entities defined below. When set to true, indexing with Elasticsearch is enabled.
<Info>
If the FlowX indexing configuration is set to false, the following configuration information and guidelines are not applicable to your use case.
</Info>
The `flowx.indexing.processInstance.indexing-type` property defines the indexing strategy for process instances. It can have one of the following values:
* **no-indexing**: No indexing will be performed for process instances.
* **http**: Direct connection from the process engine to Elasticsearch through HTTP calls.
* **kafka**: Data will be sent to be indexed via a Kafka topic using the new strategy. To implement this strategy, the Kafka Connect with Elasticsearch Sink Connector must be deployed in the infrastructure.
## Configuration steps
To enable indexing with Elasticsearch for the entire application, update the process-engine configuration with the following parameters:
* `FLOWX_INDEXING_ENABLED`: Set this parameter to `true` to enable indexing with Elastisearch for the entire application.
| Variable Name            | Enabled | Description                                               |

### Kafka Elasticsearch Connector
```yaml
spec:
class: io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector
tasksMax: 2
config:
tasks.max: "2" # The maximum number of tasks that can be run in parallel for this connector, which is 2 in this case. You can start with 2 and increase in case of huge load, but pay attention to the load that will be produced on Elasticsearch and also to the resources that you allocate to KafkaConnect so that it can support the threads.
topics: "ai.flowx.core.index.process.v1" # Source Kafka topic. Must be the same as the one declared in the process defined as ${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}.core.index.process${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}
key.ignore: "false" # Don't change this value! This tells Kafka Connect (KC) to process the key of the message - it will be used as the ID of the object in Elasticsearch.
schema.ignore: "true" # Don't change this value!!! This tells KC to ignore the mapping from the Kafka message. Elasticsearch will use internal mapping. See below.
connection.url: "https://elasticsearch-es-http:9200" # The URL to Elasticsearch. You should configure this.
connection.username: "elastic" # The username to authenticate with Elasticsearch. You should configure this.
connection.password: "Yyh03ZI66310Hyw59MXcR8xt" # The password to authenticate with Elasticsearch. You should configure this.
elastic.security.protocol: "SSL" # The security protocol to use for connecting to Elasticsearch. You should use SSL if possible.
elastic.https.ssl.keystore.location: "/opt/kafka/external-configuration/elasticsearch-keystore-volume/keystore.jks" # You should configure the path to the keystore where the Elasticsearch key is added.
elastic.https.ssl.keystore.password: "MPx57vkACsRWKVap" # The password for the keystore file. You should configure this.
elastic.https.ssl.key.password: "MPx57vkACsRWKVap" # The password for the key within the keystore file.
elastic.https.ssl.keystore.type: "JKS" # The type of the keystore file. It is set to "JKS" (Java KeyStore).
elastic.https.ssl.truststore.location: "/opt/kafka/external-configuration/elasticsearch-keystore-volume/keystore.jks" # you should configure the path to the keystore where the Elasticsearch key is added.
elastic.https.ssl.truststore.password: "MPx57vkACsRWKVap" # The password for the truststore file. You should configure this
elastic.https.ssl.truststore.type: "JKS" # The type of the truststore file. It is set to "JKS".
elastic.https.ssl.protocol: "TLS" # The SSL/TLS protocol to use for communication. It is set to "TLS".
batch.size: 1000 # The size of the message batch that KC will process. This should be fine as default value. If you experience slowness and want to increase the speed, changing this may help but it will be based on your scenario. Consult the documentation for more details.
linger.ms: 1 # #Start with this value and change it only if needed. Consult the documentation for connector for more details.
read.timeout.ms: 30000 # Increased to 30000 from the default 3000 due to flush.synchronously = true.
flush.synchronously: "true" # Don't change this value! The way of writing to Elasticsearch. It must stay "true" for the router below to work.
drop.invalid.message: "true" # Don't change this value! If set to false, the connector will wait for a configuration that allows processing the message. If set to true, the connector will drop the invalid message.
behavior.on.null.values: "IGNORE" # Don't change this value! Must be set to IGNORE to avoid blocking the processing of null messages.
behavior.on.malformed.documents: "IGNORE" # Don't change this value!  Must be IGNORE to avoid blocking the processing of invalid JSONs.
write.method: "UPSERT" # Don't change this value!  UPSERT to create or update the index.
type.name: "_doc" # Don't change this value! This is the name of the Elasticsearch type for indexing.
key.converter: "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter" # Don't change this value!
key.converter.schemas.enable: "false" # Don't change this value! No schema defined for the key in the message.
value.converter: "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter" # Don't change this value!
value.converter.schemas.enable: "false" # Don't change this value! No schema defined for the value in the message body.
transforms: "routeTS" # Don't change this value! This represents router that helps create indices dynamically based on the timestamp (process instance start date).
transforms.routeTS.type: "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.TimestampRouter" # Don't change this value! It helps with routing the message to the correct index.
transforms.routeTS.topic.format: "process_instance-${timestamp}" # You should configure this. It is important that this value must start with the value defined in process-engine config: flowx.indexing.processInstance.index-name. The name of the index will start with a prefix ("process_instance-" in this example) and must have the timestamp appended after for dynamically creating indices. For backward compatibility (utilizing the data in the existing index), the prefix must be "process_instance-". However, backward compatibility isn't specifically required here.
transforms.routeTS.timestamp.format: "yyyyMMdd" # This format ensures that the timestamp is represented consistently and can be easily parsed when creating or searching for indices based on the process instance start date. You can change this with the value you want. If you want monthly indexes set it to "yyyyMM". But be aware that once you set it, when you change it, the existing object indexed will not be updated anymore. The update messages will be treated as new objects and indexed again because they are going to be sent to new indexes. This is important! Try to find your index size and stick with it.
```
### HTTP indexing
```yaml
flowx:
indexing:
enabled: true
processInstance:
indexing-type: http
index-name: process_instance
shards: 1
replicas: 1
```
If you don't want to remove the existing configuration parameters, you can use the following example:
```yaml
spring:
elasticsearch:
index-settings:
name: process_instance
shards: 1
replicas: 1
flowx.use-elasticsearch: true
flowx:
indexing:
enabled: ${flowx.use-elasticsearch}
processInstance:
indexing-type: http
index-name: ${spring.elasticsearch.index-settings.name}
shards: ${spring.elasticsearch.index-settings.shards}
replicas: ${spring.elasticsearch.index-settings.replicas}
```
## Querying Elasticsearch
To read from multiple indices, queries in Elasticsearch have been updated. The queries now run against an index pattern that identifies multiple indices instead of a single index. The index pattern is derived from the value defined in the configuration property:
`flowx.indexing.processInstance.index-name`
## Kafka topics - process events messages
This topic is used for sending the data to be indexed from Process engine. The data from this topic will be read by Kafka Connect.
* Key: `${kafka.topic.process.index.out}`
* Value: `${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}.core.index.process${kafka.topic.naming.suffix}`
| Default parameter (env var)       | Default FLOWX.AI value (can be overwritten) |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_INDEX\_OUT | ai.flowx.dev.core.index.process.v1          |
<Info>
The topic name, defined in the value, will be used by Kafka Connect as source for the messages to be sent to Elasticsearch for indexing.
The attribute `indexLastUpdatedTime` is new and will be populated for the kafka-connect strategy. This will tell the timestamp when the last operation was done on the object in the index.ß
</Info>
## Elasticsearch update (index template)
The mappings between messages and Elasticsearch data types need to be specified. This is achieved through an index template created by the process engine during startup. The template applies to indices starting with the value defined in `flowx.indexing.processInstance.index-name` config. Here's an example of the index template:
```json
//process_instance_template
{
"index_patterns": ["process_instance*"],
"priority": 300,
"template":
{
"mappings": {
"_doc": {
"properties": {
"_class": {

}
}
}
}
}
},
"settings":{
"number_of_shards":5, //This value will be overwritten by the value that you set at `FLOWX_INDEXING_PROCESSINSTANCE_SHARDS` environment variable.
"number_of_replicas":1
}
}
}
```
Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

# Indexing config guidelines
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/process-instance-indexing-config-guidelines
The configuration of Elasticsearch for process instances indexing depends on various factors related to the application load, the number of process instances, parallel requests, and indexed keys per process. Although the best approach to sizing and configuring Elasticsearch is through testing and monitoring under load, here are some guidelines to help you get started
## Indexing strategy
* Advantages of Multiple Small Indices:
* Fast indexing process.
* Flexibility in cleaning up old data.
* Potential Drawbacks:
* Hitting the maximum number of shards per node, resulting in exceptions when creating new indices.
* Increased search response time and memory footprint.
* Deletion
* When deleting data in Elasticsearch, it's recommended to delete entire indices instead of individual documents. Creating multiple smaller indices provides the flexibility to delete entire indices of old data that are no longer needed.
Alternatively, you can create fewer indices that span longer periods of time, such as one index per year. This approach offers small search response times but may result in longer indexing times and difficulty in cleaning up and recovering data in case of failure.
<Card title="What is indexing?" href="../../../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-elasticsearch#indexing" icon="question" />
## Shard and replica configuration
The solution includes an index template that gets created with the settings from the process-engine app (name, shards, replicas) when running the app for the first time. This template controls the settings and mapping of all newly created indices.
<Card title="What is sharding?" href="../../../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-elasticsearch#sharding" icon="question" />
<Card title="Index template" href="./elasticsearch-indexing#elasticsearch-update-index-template" icon="file" />
Once an index is created, you cannot update its number of shards and replicas. However, you can update the settings from the index template at runtime in Elasticsearch, and new indices will be created with the updated settings. Note that the mapping should not be altered as it is required by the application.
## Recommendations for resource management
To manage functional indexing operations and resources efficiently, consider the following recommendations:
* [Sizing indexes upon creation](#sizing-indexes-upon-creation)
* [Balancing](#balancing)
* [Delete unneeded indices](#delete-unneeded-indices)
* [Reindex large indices](#reindex-large-indices)
* [Force merge indices](#force-merge-indices)
* [Shrink indices](#shrink-indices)
* [Combine indices](#combine-indices)
#### Sizing indexes upon creation
Recommendations:
* Start with monthly indexes that have 2 shards and 1 replica. This setup is typically sufficient for handling up to 200k process instances per day; ensures a parallel indexing in two main shards and has also 1 replica per each main shard (4 shards in total). This would create 48 shards per year in the Elasticsearch nodes; A lot less than the default 1000 shards, so you will have enough space for other indexes as well.
* If you observe that the indexing gets really, really slow, then you should look at the physical resources / shard size and start adapting the config.
* If you observe that indexing one monthly index gets massive and affects the performance, then think about switching to weekly indices.
* If you have huge spikes of parallel indexing load (even though that depends on the Kafka connect cluster configuration), then think about adding more main shards.
* Consider having at least one replica for high availability. However, keep in mind that the number of replicas is applied to each shard, so creating many replicas may lead to increased resource usage.
* Monitor the number of shards created and estimate when you might reach the maximum shards per node, taking into account the number of nodes in your cluster.
#### Balancing
When configuring index settings, consider the number of nodes in your cluster. The total number of shards (calculated by the formula: primary\_shards\_number \* (replicas\_number +1)) for an index should be directly proportional to the number of nodes. This helps Elasticsearch distribute the load evenly across nodes and avoid overloading a single node. Avoid adding shards and replicas unnecessarily.
#### Delete unneeded indices
Deleting unnecessary indices reduces memory footprint, the number of used shards, and search time.
#### Reindex large indices
If you have large indices, consider reindexing them. Process instance indexing involves multiple updates on an initially indexed process instance, resulting in multiple versions of the same document in the index. Reindexing creates a new index with only the latest version, reducing storage size, memory footprint, and search response time.
#### Force merge indices
If there are indices with no write operations performed anymore, perform force merge to reduce the number of segments in the index. This operation reduces memory footprint and response time. Only perform force merge during off-peak hours when the index is no longer used for writing.
#### Shrink indices
If you have indices with many shards, consider shrinking them using the shrink operation. This reindexes the data into an index with fewer shards. Perform this operation during off-peak hours.
#### Combine indices
If there are indices with no write operations performed anymore (e.g., process\_instance indices older than 6 months), combine these indices into a larger one and delete the smaller ones. Use the reindexing operation during off-peak hours. Ensure that write operations are no longer needed from the FLOWX platform for these indices.
# FlowX Engine setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup
This guide provides instructions on how to set up and configure the FlowX.AI Engine to meet specific requirements.
## Infrastructure prerequisites
Before initiating the FlowX.AI Engine, ensure the following infrastructure components are properly installed and configured:
* **Kafka**: Version 2.8 or higher.
* **Elasticsearch**: Version 7.11.0 or higher.
* **PostgreSQL** - version 13 or higher for storing application data (could vary based on your preferred relational database)
* **MongoDB** - version 4.4 or higher for managing runtime builds
## Dependencies
The FlowX Engine interacts with various components critical for its operation:
* **Database**: Primary storage for the engine.
* **Redis Server**: Used for caching purposes. Refer to [Redis Configuration](../setup-guides-overview#redis-configuration).
* **Kafka**: Facilitates messaging and event-driven architecture. Details on [Configuring Kafka](#configuring-kafka).
For a microservices architecture, it’s common for services to manage their data via dedicated databases.
### Required External Services
* **Redis Cluster**: Essential for caching process definitions, compiled scripts, and Kafka responses.
* **Kafka Cluster**: Serves as the communication backbone with external plugins and integration.
## Configuration Setup
FlowX.AI Engine utilizes environment variables for configuration. Below are the key environment variables you need to configure:
* [**Database configuration**]()
* [**Configuring authorization and access roles**](#authorization--access-roles)
* [**Configuring the data source**](../setup-guides-overview#datasource-configuration)
* [**Configuring Redis**](../setup-guides-overview#redis-configuration)
* [**Configuring logging**](../setup-guides-overview#logging)
* [**Configuring Kafka**](#configuring-kafka)
* [**Configuring access roles for processes**](./configuring-access-roles-for-processes)
## Database configuration
### PostgreSQL
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` - Database URL for PostgreSQL
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` - Username for PostgreSQL
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` - Password for PostgreSQL
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME` - Driver class for PostgreSQL
### Configuring MongoDB (runtime database - additional data)
The Process Engine requires to connect to Runtime MongoDB instance to access runtime build information. Use the following environment variables for configuration:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI` - URI for connecting to MongoDB for Runtime DB (`app-runtime`)
* Format: `mongodb://${RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@<host1>,<host2>,<arbiter-host>:<port>/${DB_NAME}?retryWrites=false`
* `RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME`: ` app-runtime`
* `DB_NAME`: `app-runtime`
## Configuring script engine
FlowX.AI Engine supports multiple scripting languages for business rules and actions. Use the following environment variables to configure the script engine behavior:
<Info>
You must also enable the environment variable on **AI Developer** agent, if you have it set up.
</Info>
### Python Runtime Configuration
<Info>
**Important**: By default, FlowX.AI 4.7.1 uses Python 2.7 (Jython) as the Python runtime. To enable Python 3 via GraalPy with its 3x performance improvements, you must explicitly set the feature toggle.
</Info>
| Environment Variable            | Description                                                                                                                            | Default Value | Possible Values |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM` | Determines which Python runtime to use. When `false` or missing, Python 2.7 (Jython) is used. When `true`, Python 3 (GraalPy) is used. | `false`       | `true`, `false` |
<Warning>
Python 2.7 support will be deprecated in FlowX.AI 5.0. We recommend migrating your Python scripts to Python 3 to take advantage of improved performance and modern language features.
</Warning>
### GraalVM Cache Configuration
When using GraalVM (when `FLOWX_SCRIPTENGINE_USEGRAALVM=true`), you must ensure the engine has proper access to a cache directory within the container. By default, this is configured in the `/tmp` directory.
<Info>
For environments with filesystem restrictions or custom configurations, you need to ensure the GraalVM cache is properly configured.
</Info>
There are two methods to configure the GraalVM cache location:
#### Option 1: Using Java Options (Preferred)
Add the following Java option to your deployment configuration:
```
-Dpolyglot.engine.userResourceCache=/tmp
```
This option is set by default in the standard Docker image but might need to be included if you're overriding the Java options.

## Authorization & access roles
This section outlines the OAuth2 configuration settings for securing the Spring application, including resource server settings, security type, and access authorizations.
### Resource server settings (OAuth2 configuration)
<Warning>
Old configuration from \< v4.1 releases:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`: The base URL for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, which is responsible for authentication and authorization for clients and users, it is used to authorize clients, as well as to issue and validate access tokens.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`: A unique identifier for a client application that is registered with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, this is used to authenticate the client application when it attempts to access resources on behalf of a user.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET`: Secret Key that is used to authenticate requests made by an authorization client.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`: Security configuration env var in the Spring Security OAuth2 framework, it is used to specify the realm name used when authenticating with OAuth2 providers.
</Warning>
<Info>
New configuration, starting from v4.1 release, available below.

## Configuring Kafka
Kafka handles all communication between the FlowX.AI Engine and external plugins and integrations. It is also used for notifying running process instances when certain events occur.
### Kafka connection settings
| Environment Variable             | Description                 | Default Value    |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` | Kafka bootstrap servers     | `localhost:9092` |
| `SPRING_KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL` | Security protocol for Kafka | `"PLAINTEXT"`    |
### Kafka consumer retry settings
| Environment Variable                  | Description                                                        | Default Value |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL` | Interval between retries after `AuthorizationException` is thrown. | `10`          |
### Consumer groups & consumer threads configuration
Both a producer and a consumer must be configured:

</Frame>
### Consumer groups & consumer threads
In Kafka a consumer group is a group of consumers that jointly consume and process messages from one or more Kafka topics. Each consumer group has a unique identifier called a group ID, which is used by Kafka to manage message consumption and distribution among the members of the group.
Thread numbers, on the other hand, refer to the number of threads that a consumer application uses to process messages from Kafka. By default, each consumer instance runs in a single thread, which can limit the throughput of message processing. Increasing the number of consumer threads can help to improve the parallelism and efficiency of message consumption, especially when dealing with high message volumes.
Both group IDs and thread numbers can be configured in Kafka to optimize the processing of messages according to specific requirements, such as message volume, message type, and processing latency.
The configuration related to consumers (group ids and thread numbers) can be configured separately for each message type as it follows:
#### Consumer group configuration

### Configuring Kafka topics
<Tip>
The suggested topic pattern naming convention is the following:
```yaml
topic:
naming:
package: "ai.flowx."
environment: "dev."
version: ".v1"
prefix: ${kafka.topic.naming.package}${kafka.topic.naming.environment}
suffix: ${kafka.topic.naming.version}
engineReceivePattern: engine.receive.
pattern: ${kafka.topic.naming.prefix}${kafka.topic.naming.engineReceivePattern}*
```

## Configuring application management
The FlowX helm chart provides a management service with the necessary parameters to integrate with the Prometheus operator. However, this integration is disabled by default.
<Warning>
Old configuration from \< v4.1 releases (will be deprecated in v4.5):
* `MANAGEMENT_METRICS_EXPORT_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`: Enables or disables Prometheus metrics export.
</Warning>
<Info>
New configuration, starting from v4.1 release, available below. Note that this setup is backwards compatible, it does not affect the configuration from v3.4.x. The configuration files will still work until v4.5 release.
</Info>

# Partitioning & archiving
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/process-instance-data-archiving
Improving data management using data partitioning and the archival processes.
## Overview
<Tip>
Starting with release v4.1.1 you can enable data partitioning on FlowX.AI Engine.
</Tip>
Partitioning and archiving are data management strategies used to handle large volumes of data efficiently. They improve database performance, manageability, and storage optimization. By dividing data into partitions and archiving older or less frequently accessed data, organizations can ensure better data management, quicker query responses, and optimized storage use.
## Partitioning
Partitioning is the process of dividing a large database table into smaller, more manageable pieces, called partitions. Each partition can be managed and queried independently. The primary goal is to improve performance, enhance manageability, and simplify maintenance tasks such as backups and archiving.
Partitions can be created per day, week or month. This means that a partition ID is computed at insert time for each row of process\_instance and related tables.
Afterwards, a retention period can be setup (eg: 3 partitions). A flowx engine-driven cron job (with configurable start interval) will check if there is any partition which needs to be archived and will perform the necessary actions.
### Benefits of partitioning
* **Improved Query Performance**: By scanning only relevant partitions instead of the entire table.
* **Simplified Maintenance**: Easier to perform maintenance tasks like backups and index maintenance.
* **Data Management**: Better data organization and management by dividing data based on specific criteria such as date, range, or list.
<Info>
Database Compatibility: OracleDB and PostgreSQL.
</Info>
## Archiving
Archiving involves moving old data from the primary tables to separate archive tables. This helps in reducing the load on the primary tables, thus improving performance and manageability.
### Benefits of archiving
* **Storage Optimization**: Archived data can be compressed, saving storage space.
* **Performance Improvement**: Reduces the volume of data in primary tables, leading to faster query responses.
* **Historical Data Management**: Maintains historical data in a separate, manageable form.
## Partitioning and archiving in OracleDB
### OracleDB partitioning
<Steps>
<Step title="Concept">
OracleDB [**partitioned tables**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/vldbg/partition-concepts.html#GUID-6D369646-16AF-487B-BF32-5F6569D27C8A) are utilized, allowing for efficient data management and query performance.
</Step>
<Step title="Implementation">
Each partition can be managed and queried independently.
Example: A `process_instance` table can be partitioned by day, week, or month.
</Step>
<Step title="Benefits">
Improved query performance by scanning only relevant partitions.
Simplified maintenance tasks like backups and archiving.
</Step>
</Steps>
### OracleDB archiving
<Steps>
<Step title="Process">
Detaching the partition from the main table.
Converting the detached partition into a new table named `archived_${table_name}_${interval_name}_${reference}` for example: `archived_process_instance_monthly_2024_03` .
<Info>
The DATE is in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` if the interval is `DAY`, or in the format `yyyy-MM` if the interval is `MONTH`, or in the format `yyyy-weekOfYear` if the interval is `WEEK`.
</Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Steps">
Identify partitions eligible for archiving based on retention settings.
Detach the partition from the main table.
Create a new table with the data from the detached partition.
Optionally compress the new table to save space.
</Step>
<Step title="Benefits">
Manages historical data by moving it to separate tables, reducing the load on the main table.
Compression options (OFF, BASIC, ADVANCED) further optimize storage.
<Info>
Oracle offers several compression options—OFF, BASIC, and ADVANCED—that optimize storage. Each option provides varying levels of data compression, impacting storage savings and performance differently.
* **OFF**: No compression is applied.
* **BASIC**: Suitable for read-only or read-mostly environments, it compresses data without requiring additional licenses.
* **ADVANCED**: Offers the highest level of compression, supporting a wide range of data types and operations. It requires an Advanced Compression license and provides significant storage savings and performance improvements by keeping data compressed in memory.
For more details, you can refer to Oracle's [**Advanced Compression documentation**](https://www.oracle.com/database/advanced-compression/#rc30related).
</Info>
</Step>
</Steps>
## PostgreSQL archiving
<Steps>
<Step title="Process">
Creating a new table for the partition being archived.
Moving data from the main table to the new archive table (in batches).
<Info>
Since here the DB has more work to do than just changing some labels (actual data insert and delete vs relabel a partition into a table, for OracleDB) the data move is batched and the batch size is configurable.
</Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Steps">
Identify partitions eligible for archiving based on retention settings.
Create a new table following this naming convention: `archived__${table_name}__${interval_name}_${reference}`, example: *archived\_\_process\_instance\_\_weekly\_2024\_09* .
<Tip>
The new table is created (same name format as for OracleDB: `archived__${table_name}__${interval_name}_${reference}`) and data is moved from the primary table here.
</Tip>
Configure the batch size for data movement to control the load on the database.
</Step>
<Step title="Benefits">
Efficiently manages historical data.
Batch processing allows for better control over the archiving process and system performance.
</Step>
</Steps>
<Info>
Differences from Oracle DBs:
Archiving involves actual data movement (insert and delete operations), unlike OracleDBs  where it is mainly a relabeling of partitions.
The batch size for data movement is configurable, allowing fine-tuning of the archiving process.
</Info>
## Daily operations
Once set up, the partitioning and archiving process involves the following operations:
<Steps>
<Step title="Partition ID Calculation">
The `partition_id` is automatically calculated based on the configured interval (DAY, WEEK, MONTH).
Example for daily partitioning: `2024-03-01 13:00:00` results in `partition_id = 124061`. See the [**Partition ID calculation**](#partition-id-calculation) section.
</Step>
<Step title="Retention Management">
Data older than the configured retention interval becomes eligible for archiving and compressing.
</Step>
<Step title="Archiving process">
A cron job checks for eligible partitions.
Eligible partitions are archived and optionally compressed.
The process includes deactivating foreign keys, creating new archive tables, moving data references, reactivating foreign keys, and dropping the original partition.
</Step>
<Step title="Space management">
Archived tables remain in the database but occupy less space if compression is enabled.
**Recommendation**: to free up space, consider moving archived tables to a different database or tablespace. Additionally, you have the option to move only process instances or copy definitions depending on your needs.
</Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
When enabling partitioning, please consider the following:
**Ensure Process Termination**: Make sure that process instances get terminated. Archiving removes process instance data from the working data, making it not available in FlowX. Started instances should be finished before archiving takes place.
**Set Process Expiry**: To ensure termination of process instances prior to archiving, it is recommended to configure process expiration. Refer to the following section for guidance on setting up process expiry using FlowX Designer:
[Timer Expressions](../../docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-expressions)
</Warning>
<Info>
Future schema updates or migrations will not affect archived tables. They retain the schema from the moment of archiving.
</Info>
## Configuring partitioning and archiving
<Info>
The Partitioning and Archiving feature is optional and can be configured as needed.
</Info>
<Tip>
When starting a new version of the process-engine, we recommend manually executing the setup SQL commands from Liquibase, as they may take more time. After setup, all existing information will go into the initial partition.
</Tip>
This section contains environment variables that control the settings for data partitioning and archiving and also for the archiving scheduler. These settings determine how data is partitioned, retained, and managed, including compression and batch processing.

* When archiving process instances, data from Elasticsearch must be deleted, not just the cache but also indexed keys (e.g., those indexed for data search on process instances).
</Card>
### Elasticsearch indexing configuration
Check the Elasticsearch indexing setup here:
<Card title="Elasticsearch indexing setup" href="./configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/" icon="link" />
The partitioning configuration must be aligned with the configuration extracted from the Kafka Elasticsearch Connector, especially with the following environment variables, so the intervals are similar:
### Index partitioning
* `transforms.routeTS.topic.format: "process_instance-${timestamp}"`: This value must start with the index name defined in the process-engine config: flowx.indexing.processInstance.index-name. In this example, the index name is prefixed with "process\_instance-" and appended with a timestamp for dynamic index creation. For backward compatibility, the prefix must be "process\_instance-". However, backward compatibility is not strictly required here.
yaml
* `transforms.routeTS.timestamp.format: "yyyyMMdd"`: This format ensures that timestamps are consistently represented and easily parsed when creating or searching for indices based on the process instance start date. You can adjust this value as needed (e.g., for monthly indexes, use "yyyyMM"). However, note that changing this format will cause existing indexed objects to remain unchanged, and update messages will be treated as new objects, indexed again in new indices. It is crucial to determine your index size and maintain consistency.
Check the following Kafka Elasticsearch Connector configuration example for more details:
<Card title="Kafka Elasticsearch Connector" href="./configuring-elasticsearch-indexing/elasticsearch-indexing#kafka-elasticsearch-connector" icon="link" />
## Technical details
### Partition ID calculation
* The `partition_id` format follows this structure: `<LEVEL || YEAR || BIN_ID_OF_YEAR>`. This ID is calculated based on the start date of the `process_instance`, the partition interval, and the partition level.
* `LEVEL`: This represents the "Partitioning level," which increments with each change in the partitioning interval (for example, if it changes from `DAY` to `MONTH` or vice versa).
* `YEAR`: The year extracted from the `process_instance` date.
* `BIN_ID_OF_YEAR`: This is the ID of a bucket associated with the `YEAR`. It is created for all instances within the selected partitioning interval. The maximum number of buckets is determined by the partitioning frequency:
* **Daily**: Up to 366 buckets per year
* **Weekly**: Up to 53 buckets per year
* **Monthly**: Up to 12 buckets per year
#### Calculation example
For a timestamp of `2024-03-01 13:00:00` with a daily partitioning interval, the `partition_id`would be `124061`:
* `1`: Partitioning Level (`LEVEL`)
* `24`:  Year - 2024 (`YEAR`)
* `061`: Bucket per configuration (61st day of the year)
### Archived tables
* Naming format: `archived__${table_name}__${interval_name}_${reference}`. Examples:
* archived\_\_process\_instance\_\_monthly\_2024\_03
* archived\_\_process\_instance\_\_weekly\_2024\_09
* archived\_\_process\_instance\_\_daily\_2024\_03\_06

### Kafka topics configuration
#### Topic naming convention
Integration Designer uses a structured topic naming convention:
```
ai.flowx.{environment}.{service}.{action}.{detail}.v1
```
Key components:
* `ai.flowx.`: Base package identifier
* `{environment}`: Deployment environment (e.g., dev, prod)
* `{service}`: Specific service (e.g., core, eventsgateway)
* `{action}`: Operation type (e.g., receive, trigger)
* `{detail}`: Specific topic detail
* `v1`: Version identifier
#### Important Kafka topics
1. **Workflow Instances Topic**
* Pattern: `ai.flowx.{env}.eventsgateway.receive.workflowinstances.v1`
* Purpose: Handles workflow instance messages
* Recommended configuration:
* Retention: 7 days
* Partition count: Minimum 3
2. **Engine Receive Topics**
* Pattern: `ai.flowx.{env}.engine.receive.*`
* Purpose: Engine service communication
* Recommended configuration:
* Retention: 3 days
* Partition count: Minimum 3
3. **Integration Receive Topics**
* Pattern: `ai.flowx.{env}.integration.receive.*`
* Purpose: Integration service communication
* Recommended configuration:
* Retention: 3 days
* Partition count: Minimum 3
4. **Resource Usage Topics**
* Validation Request: `ai.flowx.{env}.application-version.resources-usages.sub-res-validation.request-integration.v1`
* Refresh: `ai.flowx.{env}.application-version.resources-usages.refresh.v1`
* Purpose: Resource tracking and validation
* Recommended configuration:
* Retention: 1 day
* Partition count: 1-2
#### Large message handling for workflow instances topic
##### Updating `max.message.bytes` configuration
The workflow instances topic requires special configuration to handle large messages. By default, Kafka has message size limitations that may prevent Integration Designer from processing large workflow payloads.
**Recommended `max.message.bytes` value**: `10485760` (10 MB)
###### Method 1: Update using AKHQ (Recommended)
1. **Access AKHQ**
* Open the AKHQ web interface
* Log in if authentication is required
2. **Navigate to Topic**
* Go to the "Topics" section
* Find the topic: `ai.flowx.dev.eventsgateway.receive.workflowinstances.v1`
3. **Edit Configuration**
* Click on the topic name
* Go to the "Configuration" tab
* Locate or add `max.message.bytes`
* Set the value to `10485760`
* Save changes

# Documents plugin setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/documents-plugin-setup
The Documents plugin provides functionality for generating, persisting, combining, and manipulating documents within the FlowX.AI system.
The plugin is available as a docker image.
## Dependencies
Before setting up the plugin, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed and configured:
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Database: You will need a PostgreSQL database to store data related to document templates and documents.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2) Database: MongoDB is required for the HTML templates feature of the plugin.
* Kafka: Establish a connection to the Kafka instance used by the FLOWX.AI engine.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/): Set up a Redis instance for caching purposes.
* S3-Compatible File Storage Solution: Deploy an S3-compatible file storage solution, such as [Min.io](https://min.io/), to store document files.
## Configuration
The plugin comes with pre-filled configuration properties, but you need to set up a few custom environment variables to tailor it to your specific setup. Here are the key configuration steps:
### Postgres database
Configure the basic Postgres settings in the `values.yaml` file:
```yaml
documentdb:
existingSecret: {{secretName}}
metrics:
enabled: true
service:
annotations:
prometheus.io/port: {{prometheus port}}
prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
type: ClusterIP
serviceMonitor:
additionalLabels:
release: prometheus-operator
enabled: true
interval: 30s
scrapeTimeout: 10s
persistence:
enabled: true
size: 4Gi
postgresqlDatabase: document
postgresqlUsername: postgres
resources:
limits:
cpu: 500m
memory: 512Mi
requests:
cpu: 200m
memory: 256Mi
service:
annotations:
fabric8.io/expose: "false"
```
### Redis server
The plugin can utilize the [Redis component](https://app.gitbook.com/@flowx-ai/s/flowx-docs/flowx-engine/setup-guide#2-redis-server) already deployed for the FLOWX.AI engine. Make sure it is configured properly.
### Document storage
Ensure that you have a deployed S3-compatible file storage solution, such as Min.io, which will be used to store document files.
### Authorization configuration
To connect to the identity management platform, set the following environment variables:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`
### Enable HTML template types
If you want to use HTML templates for documents, set the `FLOWX_HTML_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` environment variable to true.
### Datasource configuration
The service uses a Postgres/Oracle database to store data related to document templates and documents. Configure the following details using environment variables:
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`: The URL for the Postgres/Oracle database.
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`: The username for the database connection.
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`: The password for the database connection.
* `SPRING_JPA_PROPERTIES_HIBERNATE_DEFAULT_SCHEMA`: Use this property to overwrite the name of the database schema if needed.
Ensure that the user, password, connection URL, and database name are correctly configured to avoid startup errors. The datasource is automatically configured using a Liquibase script within the engine, including migration scripts.
### MongoDB configuration
Configure the MongoDB database access information by setting the `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI` environment variable to the MongoDB database URI.
### Redis configuration
Set the following values with the corresponding Redis-related values:
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST`: The host address of the Redis server.
* `SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD`: The password for the Redis server, if applicable.
* `REDIS_TTL`: The time-to-live (TTL) value for Redis cache entries.
### Conversion
<Info>
Configuration available starting with **3.4.7** platform version.
</Info>
* `FLOWX_CONVERT_DPI`:	Sets the DPI (dots per inch) for PDF to JPEG conversion. Higher values result in higher resolution images. (Default value: `150`).
### Kafka configuration
Set the following Kafka-related configurations using environment variables:
* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: The address of the Kafka server.
* `SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID`: The group ID for Kafka consumers.
* `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS`: The number of Kafka consumer threads to use.
* `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL`: The interval between retries after a `AuthorizationException` is thrown by `KafkaConsumer`.
* `KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES`: The maximum size of a message that can be received by the broker from a producer.
Each action in the service corresponds to a Kafka event. Configure a separate Kafka topic for each use case.
#### Generate
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_DOCUMENT_GENERATE_HTML_IN`: This Kafka topic is used for messages related to generating HTML documents (the topic that listens for the request from the engine)
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_DOCUMENT_GENERATE_HTML_OUT`: This Kafka topic is used for messages related to generating HTML documents (the topic on which the engine will expect the reply)
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_DOCUMENT_GENERATE_PDF_IN`: This Kafka topic is used for the input messages related to generating PDF documents (the topic that listens for the request from the engine)
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_DOCUMENT_GENERATE_PDF_OUT`: This Kafka topic is used for the output messages related to generating PDF documents, it produces messages with the result of generating a PDF document (the topic on which the engine will expect the reply)
#### Persist (uploading a file/document)

<Check>
Ensure that the Engine is listening to messages on topics with specific patterns. Use the correct outgoing topic names when configuring the documents plugin.
</Check>
Each of these Kafka topics corresponds to a specific action or functionality within the service, allowing communication and data exchange between different components or services in a decoupled manner.
### File storage configuration
Depending on your use case, you can choose either a file system or an S3-compatible cloud storage solution for document storage. Configure the file storage solution using the following environment variables:
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_PARTITION_STRATEGY`: Set the partition strategy for file storage. Use `NONE` to save documents in `minio/amazon-s3` as before, with a bucket for each process instance. Use `PROCESS_DATE` to save documents in a single bucket with a subfolder structure, for example: `bucket/2022/2022-07-04/process-id-xxxx/customer-id/file.pdf`.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_DELETION_STRATEGY` (default value: **delete**): This will keep the current behaviour of deleting the temporary files.
Other possible values:
* **disabled**: This will disable entirely the deletion of temporary files from the temporary bucket, and the responsibility to delete and clean up the bucket will move in the ownership of the admins of the implementing project.
* **deleteBypassingGovernanceRetention**: This will still delete the temporary files and further more will add in the delete request the header: `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true` , to enable deletion of governed files, in case the s3 configured user for document-plugin, will have the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SERVER_URL`: The URL of the S3-compatible server.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY`: The access key for the S3-compatible server.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for the S3-compatible server.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_PREFIX`: The prefix to use for S3 bucket names.
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_TEMP_BUCKET`: Upon file upload, the initial destination is a sandbox, from which it is subsequently transferred to the designated bucket.
<Info>
Make sure to follow the recommended [bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html) when choosing the bucket prefix name.
</Info>
### Setting maximum file size
To control the maximum file size permitted for uploads, configure the `SPRING_SERVLET_MULTIPART_MAX_FILE_SIZE` and `SPRING_SERVLET_MULTIPART_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE` variables.
<Info>
The limit is set by default to 50MB:
```yml
spring:
servlet:
contextPath: /
multipart:
max-file-size: ${MULTIPART_MAX_FILE_SIZE:50MB}    #increase the multipart file size on the request
max-request-size: ${MULTIPART_MAX_FILE_SIZE:50MB} #increase the request size
```
</Info>
### Custom font path for PDF templates
Set the `FLOWX_HTML_TEMPLATES_PDF_FONT_PATHS` config to select the font used for generating documents based on PDF templates.
### Custom font paths for PDF templates
If you want to use specific fonts in your PDF templates, override the `FLOWX_HTML_TEMPLATES_PDF_FONT_PATHS` config. By default, Calibri and DejaVuSans are available fonts.
After making these configurations, the fonts will be available for use within PDF templates.
### Logging
The following environment variables could be set in order to control log levels:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT`: Controls the log level for root Spring Boot microservice logs.
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP`: Controls the log level for application-specific logs.
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_MONGO_DRIVER`: Controls the log level for MongoDB driver logs.
Adjust these variables according to your logging requirements.
# Notifications plugin setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/notifications-plugin-setup
The Notifications plugin is available as a docker image, and it has the following dependencies.
* a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2) database
* needs to be able to connect to the Kafka instance used by the engine
* a [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance for caching notification templates
* in case you need to also attach documents to the sent notifications, the plugin will need to be able to access your chosen storage solution. It can use an S3 compatible file storage solution (we have successfully used [Min.io](https://min.io/))
The plugin comes with most of the needed configuration properties filled in, but there are a few that need to be set up using some custom environment variables.
## Dependencies
### Mongo database
Basic mongo configuration - helm values.yaml
```yaml
notification-mdb:
existingSecret: {{secretName}}
mongodbDatabase: {{NotificationDatabaseName}}
mongodbUsername: {{NotificationDatabaseUser}}
persistence:
enabled: true
mountPath: /bitnami/mongodb
size: 4Gi
replicaSet:
enabled: true
name: rs0
pdb:
enabled: true
minAvailable:
arbiter: 1
secondary: 1
replicas:
arbiter: 1
secondary: 1
useHostnames: true
serviceAccount:
create: false
usePassword: true
```
### Redis server
The plugin can use the [Redis component](https://app.gitbook.com/@flowx-ai/s/flowx-docs/flowx-engine/setup-guide#2-redis-server) already deployed for the engine.
### Document storage
You need to have an S3 compatible file storage solution deployed in your setup.
## Configuration
### Authorization configuration
The following variables need to be set in order to connect to the identity management platform:
`SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`
`SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID`
`SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET`
`SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM`
### MongoDB configuration
The only thing that needs to be configured is the DB access info, the rest will be handled by the plugin.
`SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI` - the URI for the MongoDB database
### Redis configuration
The following values should be set with the corresponding Redis related values.
`SPRING_REDIS_HOST`
`SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD`
`REDIS_TTL`
### Kafka configuration
The following Kafka related configurations can be set by using environment variables:
`SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - address of the Kafka server
`SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID` - group of consumers
`KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS` - the number of Kafka consumer threads
`KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL` - the interval between retries after `AuthorizationException` is thrown by `KafkaConsumer`
`KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES` - this is the largest size of the message that can be received by the broker from a producer.
Each action available in the service corresponds to a Kafka event. A separate Kafka topic must be configured for each use-case.
#### **Forwarding notifications to an external system**
`KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_EXTERNAL_OUT` - the notification will be forwarded on this topic to be handled by an external system
#### **Sending a notification**
`KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_IN` - topic used to trigger the request to send a notification
`KAFKA_TOPIC_NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_OUT` - topic used for sending replies after sending the notification
#### **Generating/validating an OTP**
`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_IN`
`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_GENERATE_OUT` - after the OTP was generated and send to the user, this is the topic used to send the response back to the Engine.
`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_VALIDATE_IN` - Event send on this topic with an OTP and an identifier will check if the OTP is valid
`KAFKA_TOPIC_OTP_VALIDATE_OUT` - Response to the request to validate an OTP will be sent back to the Engine on this topic
<Warning>
The Engine is listening for messages on topics with names of a certain pattern, make sure to use correct outgoing topic names when configuring the notifications plugin.
</Warning>
### File storage configuration
Based on use case you can use directly a file system or an S3 compatible cloud storage solution (for example [min.io](http://min.io/)).
The file storage solution can be configured using the following environment variables:
`APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SERVER_URL`
`APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY`
`APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_KEY`
`APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_PREFIX`
### SMTP Setup
If you want to use a custom SMTP server:
`SIMPLEJAVAMAIL_SMTP_HOST` - used by mail servers to send, receive, and/or relay outgoing mail between email senders and receivers
`SIMPLEJAVAMAIL_SMTP_PORT` - refers to the specific part of the Internet address that’s used to transfer email
`SIMPLEJAVAMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME`
`SIMPLEJAVAMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`
`SIMPLEJAVAEMAIL_TRANSPORTSTRATEGY` - sets the method on how the notifications are delivered, for example `EXTERNAL_FORWARD` for forwarding to external adapters
The email and name to be used as sender for emails sent by the plugin:
`APPLICATION_MAIL_FROM_EMAIL`
`APPLICATION_MAIL_FROM_NAME`
### Email attachments configuration
The maximum file size for files to be attached as email attachments can also be configured:
`SPRING_HTTP_MULTIPART_MAX_FILE_SIZE`
`SPRING_HTTP_MULTIPART_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`
### OTP Configuration
The desired character size and expiration time of the generated one-time-passwords can also be configured.
`FLOWX_OTP_LENGTH` - the number of characters allowed for OTP
`FLOWX_OTP_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_SECONDS` - expiry time (seconds)
### Logging
The following environment variables could be set in order to control log levels:
`LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT` - root Spring Boot microservice logs
`LOGGING_LEVEL_APP` - app level logs
`LOGGING_LEVEL_MONGO_DRIVER` - MongoDB driver logs
`LOGGING_LEVEL_THYMELEAF` - [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) logs, logs related to using notifications templates
### Error handling
`KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_ENABLED`- default value: `FALSE`→ allows control on Kafka consumer applications to handle errors and failures during message consumption - When this variable is set to `true`, it enables the consumer application to handle any errors that occur during message consumption
`KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_RETRIES`- default value: `0`→ when `KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_ENABLED` is set to `true`, this environment variable specifies the maximum number of retries that the consumer application should attempt before giving up on processing a message; for example, if `KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_RETRIES` is set to `5`, the consumer application will attempt to process a message up to 5 times before giving up
`KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_RETRY_INTERVAL`- default value: `1000`→ when `KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_ENABLED` is set to true and retries are enabled with `KAFKA_CONSUMER_ERROR_HANDLING_RETRIES`, this environment variable specifies the amount of time that the consumer application should wait before attempting to retry processing a message
<Info>
For example, if KAFKA\_CONSUMER\_ERROR\_HANDLING\_RETRY\_INTERVAL is set to 5 seconds, the consumer application will wait 5 seconds before attempting to retry processing a failed message. This interval is applied to all retry attempts, so if KAFKA\_CONSUMER\_ERROR\_HANDLING\_RETRIES is set to 5 and the retry interval is 5 seconds, the consumer application will make up to 5 attempts, waiting 5 seconds between each attempt.
</Info>
# OCR plugin setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/ocr-plugin-setup
The OCR plugin is a docker image that can be deployed using the following infrastructure prerequisites.
## Infrastructure Prerequisites:
* S3 bucket or alternative (for example, minio)
* Kafka cluster
<Warning>
Starting with `ocr-plugin 1.X` it no longer requires RabbitMQ.
The following environment from previous releases must be removed in order to use OCR plugin: `CELERY_BROKER_URL`.
</Warning>
## Deployment/Configuration
To deploy the OCR plugin, you will need to deploy `ocr-plugin` helm chart with custom values file.
Most important sections are these, but more can be extracted from helm chart.
```yaml
image:
repository: <repository>/ocr-plugin
applicationSecrets: {}
replicaCount: 2
resources: {}
env: []
```
### Credentials
S3 bucket:
```yaml
applicationSecrets:
enable: true

"extract_barcodes": 37,
"extract_signatures": 238,
"minio_signature_save": 301
}
}
```

| `CERT_REQUESTS`      | If no activity has occurred for a certain number of seconds, an attempt will be made to refresh the workers | `'CERT_REQUIRED'` |
### Workers Behavior
You can override the following environment variables:
| Environment Variable     | Definition                                                                                                  | Default Value |

| `OCR_WORK_QUEUE_TIMEOUT` | If no activity has occurred for a certain number of seconds, an attempt will be made to refresh the workers | `10`          |
<Info>
If no worker is released after `OCR_WORK_QUEUE_TIMEOUT` seconds, the application will verify whether any workers have become unresponsive and need to be restarted.
If none of the workers have died, it means they are likely blocked in some process. In this case, the application will terminate all the workers and shut down itself, hoping that the container will be restarted.

### Control Aspect Ratio
| Environment Variable      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `OCR_SIGNATURE_MAX_RATIO` | This variable sets the maximum acceptable aspect ratio for a signed scanned document (the OCR plugin will recognize a signature only if the document ratio is greater than or equal to the specified minimum ratio)                              | `1.43`        |
| `OCR_SIGNATURE_MIN_RATIO` | This variable sets the minimum acceptable aspect ratio for a signed scanned document (in this context, the OCR plugin will consider a detected signature only if the document aspect ratio is less than or equal to the specified maximum ratio) | `1.39`        |
<Info>
The plugin has been tested with aspect ratio values between 1.38 and 1.43. However, caution is advised when using untested values outside this range, as they may potentially disrupt the functionality. Adjust these parameters at your own risk and consider potential consequences, as untested values might lead to plugin instability or undesired behavior.

# Plugins setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/plugins-setup-guide-overview
To set up a plugin in your environment, you must go through the next steps.
* make sure you have all the prerequisites deployed on your environment (for example a [Redis](../../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-redis) cache instance, a DB instance, etc)
* make the necessary configurations for each plugin (DB connection data, related Kafka topic names, etc)
Once you have deployed the necessary plugins in your environment, you can start integrating them in your process definitions.
All of them listen for Kafka events sent by the **FlowX Engine** and performed certain actions depending on the received data. They can also send data back to the Engine.
Some of them require some custom templates to be configured, for these cases, a [WYSIWYG Editor](/4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/wysiwyg) is provided.
Let's go into more details on setting up and using each of them:

# Reporting setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/reporting-setup
The Reporting setup guide assists in configuring the reporting plugin, relying on specific dependencies and configurations.
## Dependencies
The reporting plugin, available as a Docker image, requires the following dependencies:
* **PostgreSQL**: Dedicated instance for reporting data storage.
* **Reporting-plugin Helm Chart**:
* Utilizes a Spark Application to extract data from the FLOWX.AI Engine database and populate the Reporting plugin database.
* Utilizes Spark Operator (more info [**here**](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/spark-operator)).
* **Superset**:
* Requires a dedicated PostgreSQL database for its operation.
* Utilizes Redis for efficient caching.
* Exposes its user interface via an ingress.
## Reporting plugin helm chart configuration
Configuring the reporting plugin involves several steps:
### Installation of Spark Operator
1. Install the Spark Operator using Helm:
```bash
helm install local-spark-release spark-operator/spark-operator \
--namespace spark-operator --create-namespace \
--set webhook.enable=true \
--set logLevel=6
```
2. Apply RBAC configurations:
```bash
kubectl apply -f spark-rbac.yaml
```
3. Build the reporting image:
```bash
docker build ...
```
4. Update the `reporting-image` URL in the `spark-app.yml` file.
5. Configure the correct database ENV variables in the `spark-app.yml` file (check them in the above examples with/without webhook).
6. Deploy the application:
```bash
kubectl apply -f operator/spark-app.yaml
```
## Spark Operator deployment options
### Without webhook
For deployments without a webhook, manage secrets and environmental variables for security:
```yaml
sparkApplication: #Defines the Spark application configuration.
enabled: "true" #Indicates that the Spark application is enabled for deployment.
schedule: "@every 5m" #A cronJob that should run at every 5 minutes.
driver: # This section configures the driver component of the Spark application.
envVars: #Environment variables for driver setup.
ENGINE_DATABASE_USER: flowx
ENGINE_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
ENGINE_DATABASE_NAME: process_engine
ENGINE_DATABASE_TYPE: postgres # To set the type of engine database, can be also changed to oracle
REPORTING_DATABASE_USER: flowx
REPORTING_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
REPORTING_DATABASE_NAME: reporting
ENGINE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: "password"
REPORTING_DATABASE_PASSWORD: "password"
executor: #This section configures the executor component of the Spark application.
envVars: #Environment variables for executor setup.
ENGINE_DATABASE_USER: flowx
ENGINE_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
ENGINE_DATABASE_NAME: process_engine
ENGINE_DATABASE_TYPE: postgres # To set the type of engine database, can be also changed to oracle
REPORTING_DATABASE_USER: flowx
REPORTING_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
REPORTING_DATABASE_NAME: reporting
ENGINE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: "password"
REPORTING_DATABASE_PASSWORD: "password"
```
<Info>
NOTE: Passwords are currently set as plain strings, which is not secure practice in a production environment.
</Info>
### With webhook
When using the webhook, employ environmental variables with secrets for a balanced security approach:
```yaml
sparkApplication:
enabled: "true"
schedule: "@every 5m"
driver:
env: #Environment variables for driver setup with secrets.
ENGINE_DATABASE_USER: flowx
ENGINE_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
ENGINE_DATABASE_NAME: process_engine
ENGINE_DATABASE_TYPE: postgres # To set the type of engine database, can be also changed to oracle
REPORTING_DATABASE_USER: flowx
REPORTING_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
REPORTING_DATABASE_NAME: reporting
extraEnvVarsMultipleSecretsCustomKeys:
- name: postgresql-generic
secrets: #Secrets retrieved from a generic source.
ENGINE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgresql-password
REPORTING_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgresql-password
executor:
env: #Environment variables for executor setup with secrets.
ENGINE_DATABASE_USER: flowx
ENGINE_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
ENGINE_DATABASE_NAME: process_engine
ENGINE_DATABASE_TYPE: postgres # To set the type of engine database, can be also changed to oracle
REPORTING_DATABASE_USER: flowx
REPORTING_DATABASE_URL: postgresql:5432
REPORTING_DATABASE_NAME: reporting
extraEnvVarsMultipleSecretsCustomKeys:
- name: postgresql-generic
secrets: #Secrets retrieved from a generic source.
ENGINE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgresql-password
REPORTING_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgresql-password
```
<Info>
In Kubernetes-based Spark deployments managed by the Spark Operator, you can define the sparkApplication configuration to customize the behavior, resources, and environment for both the driver and executor components of Spark jobs. The driver section allows fine-tuning of parameters specifically pertinent to the driver part of the Spark application.

### Superset configuration
Detailed Superset Configuration Guide:
<Card title="Superset configuration" href="https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/helm/superset/README.md" icon="link" />
<Card title="Superset docker image" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset" icon="link" />
Refer to Superset Documentation for in-depth information:
<Card title="Superset documentation" href="https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro/" icon="link" />
## Post-installation steps
After installation, perform the following essential configurations:
### Datasource configuration
For document-related data storage, configure these environment variables:
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
Ensure accurate details to prevent startup errors. The Liquibase script manages schema and migrations.
### Redis configuration
The following values should be set with the corresponding Redis-related values:
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST`
* `SPRING_REDIS_PORT`
## Keycloak configuration
To implement alternative user authentication:
* Override `AUTH_TYPE` in your `superset.yml` configuration file:
* Set `AUTH_TYPE: AUTH_OID`
* Provide the reference to your `openid-connect` realm:
* `OIDC_OPENID_REALM: 'flowx'`
With this configuration, the login page changes to a prompt where the user can select the desired OpenID provider.
### Extend the security manager
Firstly, you will want to make sure that flask stops using `flask-openid` and starts using `flask-oidc` instead.
To do so, you will need to create your own security manager that configures `flask-oidc` as its authentication provider.
```yml
extraSecrets:
keycloak_security_manager.py: |
from flask_appbuilder.security.manager import AUTH_OID
from superset.security import SupersetSecurityManager
from flask_oidc import OpenIDConnect
```
To enable OpenID in Superset, you would previously have had to set the authentication type to `AUTH_OID`.
The security manager still executes all the behavior of the super class, but overrides the OID attribute with the `OpenIDConnect` object.
Further, it replaces the default OpenID authentication view with a custom one:
```yml
from flask_appbuilder.security.views import AuthOIDView
from flask_login import login_user
from urllib.parse import quote
from flask_appbuilder.views import expose
from flask import request, redirect
class AuthOIDCView(AuthOIDView):
@expose('/login/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login(self, flag=True):
sm = self.appbuilder.sm
oidc = sm.oid
superset_roles = ["Admin", "Alpha", "Gamma", "Public", "granter", "sql_lab"]
default_role = "Admin"
@self.appbuilder.sm.oid.require_login
def handle_login():
user = sm.auth_user_oid(oidc.user_getfield('email'))
if user is None:
info = oidc.user_getinfo(['preferred_username', 'given_name', 'family_name', 'email', 'roles'])
roles = [role for role in superset_roles if role in info.get('roles', [])]
roles += [default_role, ] if not roles else []
user = sm.add_user(info.get('preferred_username'), info.get('given_name', ''), info.get('family_name', ''),
info.get('email'), [sm.find_role(role) for role in roles])
login_user(user, remember=False)
return redirect(self.appbuilder.get_url_for_index)
return handle_login()
@expose('/logout/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def logout(self):
oidc = self.appbuilder.sm.oid
oidc.logout()
super(AuthOIDCView, self).logout()
redirect_url = request.url_root.strip('/')
# redirect_url = request.url_root.strip('/') + self.appbuilder.get_url_for_login
return redirect(
oidc.client_secrets.get('issuer') + '/protocol/openid-connect/logout?redirect_uri=' + quote(redirect_url))
```
On authentication, the user is redirected back to Superset.
### Configure Superset authentication
Finally, we need to add some parameters to the superset .yml file:
```yml
'''
---------------------------KEYCLOACK ----------------------------
'''
curr  =  os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_OID
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS =  curr + '/pythonpath/client_secret.json'
OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_SECURE = True
OIDC_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL = True
OIDC_OPENID_REALM: 'flowx'
OIDC_INTROSPECTION_AUTH_METHOD: 'client_secret_post'
CUSTOM_SECURITY_MANAGER = OIDCSecurityManager
AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION = False
AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE = 'Admin'
OVERWRITE_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://{{ .Values.flowx.ingress.reporting }}/oidc_callback'
'''
--------------------------------------------------------------
'''
```
# Task management setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/task-management-plugin-setup
Configure and deploy the Task Management plugin.
The Task Management plugin is available as a Docker image and serves as a dedicated microservice within the FlowX platform ecosystem.
## Dependencies
The plugin requires the following components:
* A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for task storage
* A connection to the RuntimeDB for operational data
* Access to the database used by the FlowX Engine
* Connection to the Kafka instance used by the FlowX Engine
* A [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance for caching and performance optimization
While many configuration properties come pre-configured, several environment variables must be explicitly set for proper functionality.
## Configuration
## Authorization configuration & access roles
Configure the following variables to connect to your identity management platform:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL` - Base URL of your OpenID Connect provider
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID` - Client ID for authentication
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET` - Client secret for authentication
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM` - Security realm for the application
A dedicated service account must be configured in your OpenID provider to allow the Task Management microservice to access realm-specific data and perform operations:
#### OpenID connect settings
* `SECURITY_TYPE` - Indicates the security type (default: `oauth2`)
* `SECURITY_PATHAUTHORIZATIONS_0_PATH` - Defines which endpoints are protected (e.g., `/api/**`)
* `SECURITY_PATHAUTHORIZATIONS_0_ROLESALLOWED` - Roles permitted to access the defined paths
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL` - Base URL of the OpenID server
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID` - Service account client ID used for process initiation and plugin access (requires `FLOWX_ROLE` and role mapper)
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` - Service account client secret
For more detailed information about configuring the service account:
<Card title="Task Management Service Account" href="../access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#task-management-service-account" icon="file" />
### FlowX Engine datasource configuration
The service needs access to process instance data from the engine database. Configure these connection parameters:
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` - JDBC URL for the engine database
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` - Database username
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` - Database password
### MongoDB configuration
Configure access to the primary MongoDB instance:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI` - Connection URI for MongoDB
<Info>
Task Manager requires a runtime connection to function correctly. Starting the service without a configured and active runtime MongoDB connection is not supported.
</Info>
### Runtime MongoDB configuration
Enable the Runtime MongoDB connection:
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_RUNTIME_URI` - URI for connecting to MongoDB Runtime (`app-runtime`)
* **Format**: `mongodb://${RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME}:${RUNTIME_DB_PASSWORD}@mongodb-0.mongodb-headless,mongodb-1.mongodb-headless,mongodb-arbiter-0.mongodb-arbiter-headless:27017/${RUNTIME_DB_NAME}?retryWrites=false`
* `RUNTIME_DB_USERNAME` - Username for runtime database (typically `app-runtime`)
* `RUNTIME_DB_NAME` - Name of runtime database (typically `app-runtime`)
* `RUNTIME_DB_PASSWORD` - Password for runtime database
### Redis Configuration
Configure the Redis cache with these parameters:
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST` - Redis server hostname or IP address
* `SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD` - Authentication password for Redis
* `REDIS_TTL` - Time-to-live for cached items
## Kafka configuration
Configure the Kafka integration using these environment variables:
* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - Address of the Kafka server(s)
* `SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID` - Consumer group identifier
* `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS` - Number of Kafka consumer threads
* `KAFKA_CONSUMER_EXCLUDE_USERS_THREADS` - Number of threads for processing user exclusion events
* `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL` - Time interval between retries after `AuthorizationException`
* `KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES` - Maximum message size that can be received from producers
### Kafka topics
Each action available in the service corresponds to a Kafka event. A separate Kafka topic must be configured for each use-case:
* **Process Management**
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_START_OUT` - used for running hooks; the engine receives a start process request for a hook on this topic (must be matched with the corresponding start\_in topic on the engine side)
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_OUT` - used to update the engine on task manager operations such as assignment, unassignment, hold, unhold and terminate (must be matched with the operations\_in topic on the engine side)
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_OPERATIONS_BULK_OUT` - used for bulk operations on tasks, sending multiple operations at once to the engine
* **Scheduling**
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_IN` - used to receive a message from the task manager when it's time to run a hook (for hooks configured with SLA)
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_OUT_SET` - sends a message to the scheduler to set hooks or exclude users from automatic assignment when they are assigned to out of office
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_OUT_STOP` - sends a message to the scheduler to stop the schedule for previously set actions
* **User Management**
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_EXCLUDE_USERS_SCHEDULE_IN` - used to receive a message from the scheduler when users need to be excluded from assignments
* **Task Operations**
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_TASK_IN` - used to receive a message from the engine to start a new task (must be matched with the corresponding task\_out topic on the engine side)
* **Events and Integration**
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_EVENTS_GATEWAY_OUT_MESSAGE` - outgoing messages for Events Gateway
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_RESOURCES_USAGES_REFRESH`- used to trigger a refresh of resource usage information
<Info>
The Engine listens for messages on topics with specific naming patterns. Ensure you use the correct outgoing topic names when configuring the Task Management plugin to maintain proper communication with the engine.
</Info>
## Logging configuration
Control logging verbosity with these environment variables:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT` - Root Spring Boot microservice logs
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP` - Application-level logs
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_MONGO_DRIVER` - MongoDB driver logs
### Filtering feature
* `FLOWX_ALLOW_USERNAME_SEARCH_PARTIAL` - Enables filtering possible assignees by partial names (default: `true`)
### Scheduled jobs
The Task Management plugin includes scheduled maintenance jobs:
* `SCHEDULER_USERSCACHESCLEANUP_CRONEXPRESSION` - Cron expression for user cache cleanup (default: `0 0 0 * *?` - every day at midnight)
### Resource usage monitoring
The plugin includes a resource usage monitoring feature that can be configured:
* `FLOWX_LIB_RESOURCES_USAGES_ENABLED` - Enable resource usage tracking (default: `true`)
* `FLOWX_LIB_RESOURCES_USAGES_REFRESH_LISTENER_ENABLED` - Enable refresh listener (default: `true`)
* `FLOWX_LIB_RESOURCES_USAGES_REFRESH_LISTENER_COLLECTOR_THREAD_COUNT` - Number of threads for resource collection (default: `5`)

* `FLOWX_LIB_RESOURCES_USAGES_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID_RESOURCES_USAGES_REFRESH` - Consumer group for resource usage refresh events (default: `taskMgmtResourcesUsagesRefreshGroup`)
* `FLOWX_LIB_RESOURCES_USAGES_KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS_RESOURCES_USAGES_REFRESH` - Number of threads for processing resource usage events (default: `3`)
### Database Migration
The Task Management plugin uses Mongock for MongoDB migrations:
* `MONGOCK_CHANGE_LOGS_SCAN_PACKAGE` - Package to scan for database change logs
# Runtime manager setup
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/runtime-manager
This guide provides a step-by-step process for setting up and configuring the Runtime Manager module, including database, Kafka, and OAuth2 authentication settings to manage runtime and build configurations.
<Info>
The [**Application Manager**](./application-manager) and **Runtime Manager** share the same container image and Helm chart. Refer to the **Deployment Guidelines** in the release notes to ensure compatibility and verify the correct version.
</Info>
## Infrastructure prerequisites
The Runtime Manager service requires the following components to be set up before it can be started:
* **PostgreSQL** - version 13 or higher for managing application data
* **MongoDB** - version 4.4 or higher for managing runtime data
* **Redis** - version 6.0 or higher (if required)
* **Kafka** - version 2.8 or higher for event-driven communication between services
* **OAuth2 Authentication** - Ensure a compatible OAuth2 authorization server is configured.
## Dependencies
* [**Database configuration**](#database-configuration)
* [**Kafka configuration**](#configuring-kafka)
* [**Authentication & access roles**](#configuring-authentication-and-access-roles)
* [**Logging**](./setup-guides-overview#logging)
## Configuration
### General environment variables
The following environment variables provide essential configurations:
* `LOGGING_CONFIG_FILE` - Path to the logging configuration file for customized logging levels.
* `SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME` - Sets the application name.
* **Default Value:** `application-manager` -> must be changed to `runtime-manager`.
### Database configuration
The Runtime Manager uses the same PostgreSQL (to store application data) and MongoDB (to manage runtime data) as [**application-manager**](application-manager). Configure these database connections with the following environment variables:
#### PostgreSQL (Application data)
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` - Database URL for the PostgreSQL data source  (same as the one configured in `application-manager` setup)
#### MongoDB (Runtime data)
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI` - URI for connecting to MongoDB for runtime data  (same as the one configured in `application-manager` setup)
* Format: `mongodb://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@<host1>,<host2>,<arbiter-host>:<port>/${DB_NAME}?retryWrites=false`
* `DB_USERNAME`: `app-runtime`
* `DB_NAME`: `app-runtime`
* `DB_PASSWORD`: DB password.
### Configuring Kafka
Kafka is used for event-driven operations within the Runtime Handler. Set up the Kafka configuration using the following environment variables:
* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - Address of the Kafka server in the format `host:port`
* `KAFKA_TOPIC_NAMING_ENVIRONMENT` - Environment-specific suffix for Kafka topics
#### Kafka OAuth Authentication
To securely integrate with Kafka, configure the following OAuth credentials:
* `KAFKA_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth Client ID for Kafka
* `KAFKA_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth Client Secret for Kafka
* `KAFKA_OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_URI` - OAuth Token Endpoint URI for obtaining Kafka tokens
* **Format:** `https://<auth-server>/auth/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token`
### Configuring authentication and access roles
Runtime Handler uses OAuth2 for secure access control. Set up the OAuth2 configurations with the following environment variables:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL` - Base URL for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID` - Unique identifier for the client application registered with the OAuth 2.0 server
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET` - Secret key for authenticating requests made by the authorization client
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM` - The realm name for OAuth2 authentication
### Redis configuration (optional)
If Redis is required for caching, set the following environment variable:
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST` - Hostname or IP address of the Redis server
### Configuring file storage
For file storage needs, configure the S3-compatible storage with the following environment variable:
* `APPLICATION_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SERVER_URL` - URL of the S3-compatible storage server for storing application files.
### Ingress configuration
For exposing the Runtime manager service, configure public, admin and adminInstances ingress settings:
```yaml
ingress:
enabled: true
public:
enabled: true
hostname: "{{ .Values.flowx.ingress.public }}"
path: /rtm/api/runtime(/|$)(.*)
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /api/runtime/$2

## Scheduler configuration
### Scheduler
```yaml
scheduler:
thread-count: 30  # Configure the number of threads to be used for sending expired messages.
callbacks-thread-count: 60 # Configure the number of threads for handling Kafka responses, whether the message was successfully sent or not
cronExpression: "*/10 * * * * *" #every 10 seconds
retry: # new retry mechanism
max-attempts: 3
seconds: 1
thread-count: 3
cronExpression: "*/10 * * * * *" #every 10 seconds
cleanup:
cronExpression: "*/25 * * * * *" #every 25 seconds
```
* `SCHEDULER_THREAD_COUNT`: Used to configure the number of threads to be used for sending expired.
* `SCHEDULER_CALLBACKS_THREAD_COUNT`: Used to configure the number of threads for handling Kafka responses, whether the message was successfully sent or not.
<Info>
The "scheduler.cleanup.cronExpression" is valid for both scheduler and timer event scheduler.
</Info>
#### Retry mechanism
* `SCHEDULER_RETRY_THREAD_COUNT`: Specify the number of threads to use for resending messages that need to be retried.
* `SCHEDULER_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`: This configuration parameter sets the number of retry attempts. For instance, if it's set to 3, it means that the system will make a maximum of three retry attempts for message resending.
* `SCHEDULER_RETRY_SECONDS`: This configuration parameter defines the time interval, in seconds, for retry attempts. For example, when set to 1, it indicates that the system will retry the operation after a one-second delay.
#### Cleanup
* `SCHEDULER_CLEANUP_CRONEXPRESSION`: It specifies how often, in seconds, events that have already been processed should be cleaned up from the database.
#### Recovery mechanism
```yaml
flowx:
timer-calculator:
delay-max-repetitions: 1000000
```
<Tip>
You have a "next execution" set for 10:25, and the cycle step is 10 minutes. If the instance goes down for 2 hours, the next execution time should be 12:25, not 10:35. To calculate this, you add 10 minutes repeatedly to 10:25 until you reach the current time. So, it would be 10:25 + 10 min + 10 min + 10 min, until you reach the current time of 12:25. This ensures that the next execution time is adjusted correctly after the downtime.
</Tip>
* `FLOWX_TIMER_CALCULATOR_DELAY_MAX_REPETITIONS`: This means that, for example, if our cycle step is set to one second and the system experiences a downtime of two weeks, which is equivalent to 1,209,600 seconds, and we have the "max repetitions" set to 1,000,000, it will attempt to calculate the next schedule. However, when it reaches the maximum repetitions, an exception is thrown, making it impossible to calculate the next schedule. As a result, the entry remains locked and needs to be rescheduled. This scenario represents a critical case where the system experiences extended downtime, and the cycle step is very short (e.g., 1 second), leading to the inability to determine the next scheduled event.
### Timer event scheduler
<Info>
Configuration for Timer Event scheduler designed to manage timer events. Similar configuration to scheduler.
</Info>
```yaml
timer-event-scheduler:
thread-count: 30
callbacks-thread-count: 60
cronExpression: "*/1 * * * * *" #every 1 seconds
retry:
max-attempts: 3
seconds: 1
thread-count: 3
cronExpression: "*/5 * * * * *" #every 5 seconds
```
## OpenID connect settings
<Info>
Default settings are for Keycloak.
</Info>
* `SECURITY_TYPE`: Indicates that OAuth 2.0 is the chosen security type, default value: `oauth2`.
* `SECURITY_PATHAUTHORIZATIONS_0_PATH`: Defines a security path or endpoint pattern. It specifies that the security settings apply to all paths under the "/api/" path. The `**` is a wildcard that means it includes all subpaths under "/api/\*\*".
* `SECURITY_PATHAUTHORIZATIONS_0_ROLESALLOWED`: Specifies the roles allowed for accessing the specified path. In this case, the roles allowed are empty (""). This might imply that access to the "/api/\*\*" paths is open to all users or that no specific roles are required for authorization.
```yaml example
security:
type: oauth2
pathAuthorizations:
- path: "/api/**"
rolesAllowed: "ANY_AUTHENTICATED_USER"
```
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL`: This setting specifies the base URL of the OpenID server, which is used for authentication and authorization.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`: This setting specifies the service account that is essential for enabling the [**Start Timer**](../docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-start-event) event node. Ensure that you provide the correct client ID for this service account.
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`: Along with the client ID, you must also specify the client secret associated with the service account for proper authentication.
More details about the necessary service account, here:
[Scheduler service account](./access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#scheduler-service-account)
```yaml example
oauth2:
base-server-url: http://localhost:8080/auth
realm: flowx
client:
access-token-uri: ${security.oauth2.base-server-url}/realms/${security.oauth2.realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token
client-id: flowx-platform-authorize
client-secret: wrongsecret

user-info-uri: ${security.oauth2.base-server-url}/realms/${security.oauth2.realm}/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
service-account:
admin:
client-id: flowx-scheduler-core-sa
client-secret: wrongsecret
```

Each action available in the service corresponds to a Kafka event. A separate Kafka topic must be configured for each use-case.
<Info>
Make sure the topics configured for this service don't follow the engine pattern.
</Info>
## Configuring logging
The following environment variables could be set in order to control log levels:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT: INFO` (Default): Root Spring Boot microservice logs
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP`: App level logs

# Setup guides
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/4.7.x/setup-guides/setup-guides-overview
Deploying microservices involves breaking down an application into smaller, modular components that can be independently deployed. Each microservice should include all necessary dependencies and configurations to ensure smooth and reliable operation.
Microservices can be deployed using container management systems like Docker or Kubernetes, which allow for the deployment of multiple microservices within a unified environment.
<Tip>
To achieve a smooth and successful deployment of your microservices, it's crucial to follow the recommended installation order. Proper sequencing avoids dependency issues and ensures that each service operates correctly within the overall system architecture.
</Tip>
**Recommended Installation Order for Microservices**:
<Steps>
<Step title="advancing-controller" />
<Step title="process-engine" />
<Step title="All backend services in parallel">
Deploy the following backend services simultaneously, as they are foundational and interdependent:
* admin
* audit-core
* task-management
* scheduler-core
* data-search
* license-core
* events-gateway
* others (any additional microservices)
</Step>
<Step title="designer">
Finally, deploy the Frontend service. This should be done after the backend is fully operational, although it can be deployed alongside the backend if it won’t be accessed from the browser immediately (note that the platform status might crash or be incomplete while the backend is still starting up).
</Step>
</Steps>
Following this sequence ensures that the core components are established before dependent services start. This approach minimizes the risk of initialization errors and incomplete system states. Prioritizing backend services is essential, as they provide the foundation for other components.
## Environment variables
Environment variables are variables that are set in the system environment and can be used by applications and services to store and access configuration information. Environment variables typically include settings such as paths to directories, file locations, settings for the operating system and applications, and more.
Environment variables are used to store and access configuration information in a secure and efficient manner. Below you will find some examples of common/shared environment variables that need to be set for different services and components.
## Authorization & access roles
An identity management platform is a software system that helps you manage authorization & access roles, including user accounts, passwords, access control, and authentication. Identity management platforms typically offer features such as user provisioning, identity federation, and single sign-on.
The following variables need to be set in order to connect to the identity management platform:
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_BASE_SERVER_URL` - the base URL for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, which is responsible for authentication and authorization for clients and users, it is used to authorize clients, as well as to issue and validate access tokens
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID` - a unique identifier for a client application that is registered with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, this is used to authenticate the client application when it attempts to access resources on behalf of a user
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET` - secret key that is used to authenticate requests made by an authorization client
* `SECURITY_OAUTH2_REALM` - security configuration env var in the Spring Security OAuth2 framework, it is used to specify the realm name used when authenticating with OAuth2 providers
<Card title="Access Management" href="./access-management/access-management-overview" icon="link" />
## Datasource configuration
Datasource configuration is the process of configuring a data source, such as a database, file, or web service, so that an application can connect to it and use the data. This typically involves setting up the connection parameters, such as the host, port, username, and password.
In some cases, additional configuration settings may be required, such as specifying the type of data source (e.g. Oracle, MySQL, etc.) or setting up access control for data access.
Environment variables are more secure than hard-coding credentials in the application code and make it easier to update data source parameters without having to modify the application code.
<Info>
Some microservices ([**Admin**](./admin-setup-guide) microservice, for example, connects to the same Postgres / Oracle database as the [**FlowX Engine**](./flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup)).
</Info>
<Info>
Depending on the data source type, various parameters may need to be configured. For example, if connecting to an Oracle database, the driver class name, and the database schema must be provided. For MongoDB, the URI is needed.
</Info>
The following variables need to be set in order to set the datasource:
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` - environment variable used to configure a data source URL for a Spring application, it typically contains the JDBC driver name, the server name, port number, and database name
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` - environment variable used to set the username for the database connection, this can be used to connect to a database instance
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` - environment variable used to store the password for the database connection, this can be used to secure access to the database and ensure that only authorized users have access to the data
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVERCLASSNAME` (❗️only for Oracle DBs) - environment variable used to set the class name of the JDBC driver that the Spring DataSource will use to connect to the database
* `SPRING_JPA_PROPERTIES_HIBERNATE_DEFAULTSCHEMA` (❗️only for Oracle DBs) - environment variable used to overwrite the name of the database schema
* `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI` (❗️only for MongoDB) - environment variable used to provide the connection string for a MongoDB database that is used with, this connection string provides the host, port, database name, user credentials, and other configuration details for the MongoDB server
<Warning>
You will need to make sure that the user, password, connection link and db name are configured correctly, otherwise, you will receive errors at start time.
</Warning>
<Info>
The datasource is configured automatically via a liquibase script inside the engine. All updates will include migration scripts.
</Info>
## Kafka
The following Kafka-related configurations can be set by using environment variables:
* `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` - environment variable used to configure the list of brokers to which the Kafka client will connect, this is a comma-separated list of host and port pairs that are the addresses of the Apache Kafka brokers in a Kafka cluster
* `SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID` - environment variable is used to set the consumer group ID for the Kafka consumer, it is used to identify which consumer group the consumer belongs to and allows the Kafka broker to manage which messages are consumed by each consumer in the group
<Info>
- `SPRING_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID` - might be different for the services that have the group id separated in topics, also thread numbers.
</Info>
* `KAFKA_CONSUMER_THREADS` - environment variable used to control the number of threads that a Kafka consumer instance can use to consume messages from a cluster, it defines the number of threads that the consumer instance should use to poll for messages from the Kafka cluster
* `KAFKA_AUTH_EXCEPTION_RETRY_INTERVAL` - environment variable used to set the interval at which Kafka clients should retry authentication exceptions (the interval between retries after AuthorizationException is thrown by KafkaConsumer)
* `KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES` - this is the largest size of the message that can be received by the broker from a producer.
Each action available in the service corresponds to a Kafka event. A separate Kafka topic must be configured for each use case.
<Warning>
FlowX Engine is listening for messages on topics with names of a certain pattern, make sure to use correct outgoing topic names when configuring the services.
</Warning>
## Redis configuration
Redis configuration involves setting up the connection parameters, such as the host, port, username, and password. In some cases, additional configuration settings may be required, such as specifying the type of data store or setting up access control for data access.
* `SPRING_REDIS_HOST` - environment variable used to configure the hostname or IP address of a Redis server when [](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/workflow-patterns/)using Spring Data Redis
* `SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD` - environment variable is used to store the password used to authenticate with a Redis server, it is used to secure access to the Redis server and should be kept confidential
* `REDIS_TTL` - environment variable is used to specify the maximum time-to-live (TTL) for a key in Redis, it is used to set a limit on how long a key can exist before it is automatically expired (Redis will delete the key after the specified TTL has expired)
## Debugging
Advanced debugging features can be enabled. When this happens, snapshots of the process status will be taken after each action and can be later used for debugging purposes. This feature comes with an exponential increase in database usage, so we suggest having the flag set to true on debugging media and false production ones.
## Logging
The following environment variables could be set in order to control log levels:
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT` - root Spring Boot microservice logs
* `LOGGING_LEVEL_APP` - controls the verbosity of the application's logs and how much information is recorded (app level logs)
## License model
A license model is a set of rules and regulations governing how software can be used, distributed, and modified. It also outlines the rights and responsibilities of the software user and the software developer. Common license models include open source, freeware, shareware, and commercial software.
Most of the third-party components used by FlowX are under [**Apache License 2.0**](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) source code.
## Third-party components
Third-party components are software components or libraries that are not part of FLOWX.AI but are instead created by another company or individual and used in a development project.
These components can range from databases and operating systems to user interface components and libraries that provide support for a specific feature or task.
Third party components are components such as libraries, frameworks, APIs, etc.

## Additional configuration
### Updates
New updates have been made to the backend and designer configurations. The following changes have been made:
* **Backend**: The Java container base image has been updated from **11.0.15** to **11.0.17\_8**
* **Designer**: The Nginx container base image has been updated from **1.19** to **1.23.2**
### Redis configuration
```
disableCommands:
- CONFIG
# enable keyspace notif as CONFIG is disabled
notify-keyspace-events KEA
```
The above command is enabling key space notifications in Redis by setting the `notify-keyspace-events` configuration parameter to "KEA". The `notify-keyspace-events` configuration parameter is used to enable notifications for certain events that occur in the Redis key space.
The reason for enabling this as CONFIG is disabled is that, in this configuration, the CONFIG command is disabled, which means that the Redis server will not accept the command to change its configuration. Therefore, this line is allowing Redis to notify events in key space.
### Theming
There are two important items that need to be taken in consideration with it comes to theming:
* [`theme_components.json`](#theme_componentsjson)
* [`theme_tokens.json`](#theme_tokensjson)
#### `theme_components.json`
This JSON object is a collection of all components and their properties. Each element represents a different design element (e.g. "accordion","card", etc.).
Each element object has two main properties:
* `genericProperties` - is an array of objects that define properties such as background color, padding, and font styles for the element
* `modifiers` - is also an array of objects, each representing a different modification of the element's properties, each modifier object has a `name` property and a `properties` array, which contains more objects that define the modified properties of the element.
#### Example
```json
{
"elementName": "card",
"genericProperties": [
{
"name": "backgroundColor",

}
]
}
]
}
```
#### `theme_tokens.json`
This JSON object is a collection of color tokens for a design system. The object is structured with a "colors" object that contains multiple color objects, each representing a different color category (e.g. "primary", "secondary", "success", "warning", "error" and "neutrals").
Each color object has properties such as "name", "main" and "shades". The "name" property contains the name of the color category, the "main" property contains the main shade of the color, the "shades" is an object with key-value pairs that represent different shades of the color.
<Info>
Each key is a number representing the shade level, and each value is a hex code representing the color at that level.
</Info>
#### Example
```typescript
// COLORS
[
{
"name": "primary",
"shades": [
{"tint": 50, "hex": "#aabbcc"},
{"tint": 100, "hex": "#aabbcc"},
...
],
"main": 500
},
{
"name": "secondary",
"shades": [
{"tint": 50, "hex": "#aabbcc"},
{"tint": 100, "hex": "#aabbcc"},
...
],
"main": 500
}
]
interface ColorShade {
tint: number,
hex: string
}
interface Color {
name: string,
shades: ColorShade[]
}
```

Below you will find a Storybook which will demonstrate how components behave under different states, props, and conditions:
[Storybook](https://storybook.demo.flowxai.dev/)
<Info>
With the release of **FLOWX.AI 3.0**, there have been some changes that you need to be aware when upgrading to the latest version:
* The `flowx-process-renderer` has been migrated to `@flowx\ui-sdk`.
* As of \**FlowX 4.0*, the `paperflow-web-components` library will be deprecated. Instead, the new components can be found in `@flowx/ui-toolkit`.
</Info>
For more information, check the section below:
[Using the Angular Renderer](../../docs/3.0.0/platform-deep-dive/core-components/renderer-sdks/angular-renderer)
## **Fixed**
* Fixed a bug in the FLOWX.AI Designer where the datepicker component's default value overlapped with the field placeholder.
* Fixed an issue in FLOWX.AI Designer where users could not copy/paste nodes that had UI actions without parameters.
* Forwarding external notifications is now possible with the Notifications plugin.
* Fixed an issue where the GET enumerations list (CMS) displayed an error message about memory exceeding.
## **Changed**
### UI Designer
* Indicators → deleted **Info Tooltip** and **Hint** UI components
* added Helpertext (to replace **Info tooltip** and **Hint**) - this new element can be found on [Form elements](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements) and provides additional information about each element, which can be hidden within an infopoint
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/helpergif.gif)
### Documents plugin
* Updated document plugin file download path to use file UUID (string) instead of a numeric file ID.
### Task management plugin
* Improved filtering feature, now is possible to filter users by partial names.
[Additional configuration here](./deployment-guidelines-v3.0.0#task-management-plugin)
### FLOWX.AI Designer 👩‍🏭
#### Audit log
* The audit log now displays the name instead of identifiers for process definition, node, action, and swimlanes entities.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/audit_log_new.png)
[Audit log](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/audit)
#### Sensitive data
* Sensitive data tab has been removed from the process definition settings and a new Sensitive data switch has been added in the Data model tab.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/sensitive_data_new.png)
* Sensitive data migration is required when cloning old processes (sensitive data is deleted when cloning as it is not compatible with the new process version). Users must add the data model and keys for the new process.
[Data model](../../docs/building-blocks/process/process-definition#data-model)
#### Platform status report
* Added a new option to export the Platform Status, which will download a JSON file containing the state details of all components, enabling users to communicate the state of their instance to the support team.
* Added more data to the platform status report.
![Platform status export](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/platform_status_export.png)
#### Kafka send/receive nodes
* New icons for Kafka send/receive nodes were added.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/new_kafka_nodes.png)
### Process Designer
#### Process Designer keyboard commands
* Added new keyboard commands for deleting, copying, and renaming nodes in the Process Designer:
* `backspace` - delete one or several selected nodes
* `Ctrl/Cmd + C` - copy one or several selected nodes
* `R` - rename a node
### FLOWX.AI Engine 🚂
#### Kafka
* Standardized Kafka topics and naming pattern in FLOWX.AI Engine, reducing confusion and errors by allowing for configuration only for the package name, environment name, and version, without having to list all topic names.
#### Performance
* Databases performance improvements, including clear caching (clear cache must be performed per process for process definitions).
<Info>
For stages, integrations, and generic parameters, clear cache is performed globally, when it comes to process definitions, clear cache must be done per process.
</Info>
### License model
* In the license model, another label/alias can be used instead of PII.
### Data search
* The ElasticSearch index for data search is now configurable. More info on:
[Deployment guidelines](./deployment-guidelines-v3.0.0#data-search)
## **UX/UI Improvements**
* The process instance search button has been removed, and search is now done automatically.
* Swimlanes interaction has been improved.
* It is possible now to select and delete multiple nodes in Process Designer.
Additional information regarding the deployment for v3.0 is available below:
## **Security**
* Improved security for Redis configuration.

#### Advancing controller
<Warning>
If the parallel advancing configuration already exists, resetting the 'advancing' database must be done by executing the SQL command `DROP DATABASE advancing;`. Once the database has been dropped, the Liquibase script will automatically re-enable it.
</Warning>
* `SPRING_JPA_DATABASE` - value: `oracle`
* `SPRING_JPA_DATABASE_PLATFORM`
* `SPRING_DATASOUCE_URL`
* `SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVERCLASSNAME`

</Frame>
So, what are you waiting for? Grab a snack, sit back, and get ready to explore the newest version of **FLOWX.AI**.
## **New features** 🆕
### UI Designer ✍️
#### Undo/redo actions in UI Designer
The latest update now allows users to easily undo or redo any actions they perform within the UI Designer. This includes tasks such as dragging, dropping, or deleting elements from the preview section, as well as adjusting settings within the styling and settings panel.
<Info>
To undo or redo an action, users can simply click the corresponding icons in the UI Designer toolbar, or use the keyboard commands (undo: Cmd/Ctrl + Z, redo: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z) for even quicker access. This new functionality provides users with greater control and flexibility, allowing them to easily make changes and adjustments without fear of losing progress or making mistakes.
</Info>

[Deployment guidelines v3.1](./deployment-guidelines-v3.1.0#undoredo)
#### New UI element: file preview
We are excited to announce the addition of a new ready-made UI component. This new component allows users to easily display previews of documents within their designs, whether the documents are uploaded, generated during a process, or static.
With this new feature, users can create more dynamic and interactive designs that incorporate real-time document previews.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/doc_preview.gif)
[File preview](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/file-preview)
### Process designer
#### Generate data model
A data model can be generated using data values from a [process instance](../../docs/building-blocks/process/active-process/process-instance). This can be done by either merging the data model with an existing one or replacing it entirely.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/generate_data_model%20copy.gif)
[Data model](../../docs/building-blocks/process/process-definition#data-model)
## **Fixed** 🔧
* Fixed an issue where [Engine](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) and [Advancing controller](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine#advancing-controller) should be restarted if the advancing controller's database is down for a couple of minutes.
* Fixed an issue where image preview is not displayed.
* Fixed an issue where `GET child enumerations` request is not using the correct version.
* Fixed an issue where the [scheduler](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/scheduler) was sending messages multiple times.
## **Changed** 🛠️
### FLOWX.AI Engine 🚂
* [Advancing controller](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine#advancing-controller) now supports OracleDBs
[Deployment guidelines v3.1](deployment-guidelines-v3.1.0#advancing-controller-with-oracle)
### UI Designer ✍️
UI Designer improvements:
* You can now select enumeration data source for [Select](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field), [Checkbox](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/checkbox-form-field), and [Radio](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/radio-form-field) UI elements.
* Clear content button option is available in the UI Designer, as a setting at element level for [form elements](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements) populated with content.
* Form elements under hidden containers can be disabled now.
:::info
Here is a brief example: form → disabled = `true` + child form element: disabled = `false` ⇒ entire form is disabled.
:::
* Improved UI element configuration error experience - when there is an error in the element’s settings, then the element is marked and on hover, an error message is displayed.
* Added code editor in expression fields.
[UI Designer](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer)
### Process designer
* Added a new flag in process settings to use a process in task management.

[Task management](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/plugins/custom-plugins/task-management)
## **Known issues** 🙁
### Reporting
* Reporting plugin is not compatible with Oracle DBs.
### UI Designer
* When configuring an [Input UI element](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) with a 'Has clear' (content clear) property, we recommend setting a fixed width value for the element. If the width is set to 'fill', it may cause the UI to break
* The 'auto' size property for Fit W is not available for [input](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field), [select](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field), [switch](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/switch-form-field), [textarea](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/text-area) and [datepicker](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/datepicker-form-field) UI elements

So, what are you waiting for? Grab a snack, sit back, and get ready to explore the newest version of **FLOWX.AI**.
## **New features** 🆕
### UI Designer ✍️
New features for the UI Designer:
#### Segmented button
Added a new type of button - **segmented button**. It allows users to pick only one option from a group of options, and you can choose to have between 2 and 5 options in the group. The segmented button is easy to use, and can help make your application easier for people to use.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/segmented_button.gif)
#### Shadows
The new shadow feature is a visual effect that creates a sense of depth and dimensionality in UI designer elements.
The shadow option can be customized to suit the overall design aesthetic of the interface, with properties for shadow color, opacity, blur and distance from the element. It can be applied to a range of UI elements, including [root elements](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components), forms, [collections](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection), [buttons](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), messages, [images](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/image) and [file preview](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/file-preview).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/shadows_example.png)
#### Disable button - add disabled condition
A new feature has been added that allows a button to be disabled in cases where custom form validations are applied. The user can set a disabled condition for the button element, and the button will remain disabled until the validation criteria are met.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/disabled_button.gif)
### Platform
#### Set client and environment
The Designer app now allows users to set the client and environment through the **Platform Status** tab. In cases where these are not configured, a modal will be displayed on the Flowx instance, and the user will be required to enter the necessary information before accessing any other section.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/set_client_and_env.gif)
If the user lacks the required authorization, a separate modal will be prompted.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/set_client_and_env_no_roles.png)
[Additional configuration for client and environment](./deployment-guidelines-v3.2.0#client-and-environment)
### Process designer
#### Floating menu
Added a floating menu with multiple actions, including "Home", "View instance data", "Process definition", and "Info". The menu will be visible during error or loading states, with toast error displayed over it and the menu displayed above during loading states:
* the "View instance data" action opens a process instance view that overlays the rendered interface
* the "Process definition" action opens the process definition in the same tab, displaying the same version that was run
* the "Info" action displays a card with process definition info and instance start and end
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/floating_menu.gif)
### Content Management
#### CMS audit log
Added audit options for the CMS system. It keeps track of changes made to different parts of the CMS, like [Enumerations](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/enumerations), [Substitution Tags](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/substitution-tags), [Languages](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/languages), [Source Systems](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/source-systems), and [Media Library](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/media-library).
Whether you need to troubleshoot an error or are just interested in keeping a close eye on changes, the audit log is a useful tool for monitoring and debugging
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/cms_audit_log.png)
There is also a dedicated audit section for each element mentioned above.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/enum_audit.png)
[Additional configuration for CMS audit log](./deployment-guidelines-v3.2.0#cms-audit-log)
## **Bug fixes** 🔧
* **\[WEB\_SDK]** Fixed an issue where custom components were unable to access UI Actions when input keys were not defined
## **Changed** 🛠️
### UI Designer ✍️
#### Improved rendering mechanism
* The UI Designer now has an enhanced rendering mechanism that prevents the page from scrolling up upon reloading, improving the user experience
* Element bounding box in UI Designer view now reflects Spacing and Sizing settings
#### Added new "requiredTrue" validator - SWITCH element
The "requiredTrue" validator for the SWITCH element enforces that the toggle must be switched on to be valid.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/switch_required.gif)
### Notifications plugin
* New environment variables added to configure the error handler on Notifications plugin - Kafka consumer
[Additional configuration for Notifications plugin](./deployment-guidelines-v3.2.0#notifications-plugin)
### OCR plugin
* With the new release of ocr-plugin **1.0.x** version, RabbitMQ is no longer needed
* New environment variables
[Additional configuration here](./deployment-guidelines-v3.2.0#ocr-plugin)
### Process designer
* Improvement: process definitions names can only contain letters, numbers and the following special characters \`\[] () . \_ -
## **Known issues** 🙁
### Reporting
* Reporting plugin is not compatible with Oracle DBs.
### UI Designer
* When configuring an [Input UI element](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) with a 'Has clear' (content clear) property, we recommend setting a fixed width value for the element. If the width is set to 'fill', it may cause the UI to break

### Process engine
#### Process Instance Indexing through Kafka transport
Introducing a new Kafka transport strategy for sending details about process instances to be indexed in Elasticsearch. To enable indexing of process instances in Elasticsearch through Kafka, configure the following environment variables:
* `FLOWX_INDEXING_ENABLED`
| Variable Name            | Values | Description                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| FLOWX\_INDEXING\_ENABLED | true   | Enables indexing with Elasticsearch for the whole app  |
| FLOWX\_INDEXING\_ENABLED | false  | Disables indexing with Elasticsearch for the whole app |
* `FLOWX_INDEXING_PROCESSINSTANCE_INDEXING_TYPE`
| Variable Name                                    | Values      | Definition                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FLOWX\_INDEXING\_PROCESSINSTANCE\_INDEXING\_TYPE | no-indexing | No indexing is performed for process instances                                                                                      |
| FLOWX\_INDEXING\_PROCESSINSTANCE\_INDEXING\_TYPE | http        | Process instances are indexed via HTTP (direct connection from process-engine to Elastic Search thorugh HTTP calls)                 |
| FLOWX\_INDEXING\_PROCESSINSTANCE\_INDEXING\_TYPE | kafka       | Process instances are indexed via Kafka (send data to be indexed through a kafka topic - the new strategy for the applied solution) |
<Warning>
For Kafka indexing, the Kafka Connect with Elastic Search Sink Connector must be deployed in the infrastructure.
</Warning>
* `FLOWX_INDEXING_PROCESSINSTANCE_INDEX_NAME`: specify the name of the index used for process instances
| Variable Name                                           | Values            | Definition                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FLOWX\_INDEXING\_PROCESSINSTANCE\_REPLICAS | 1      | The number of replicas for the Elasticsearch index storing process instances |
#### Topics related to process event messages
##### Process engine new kafka topics
| Default parameter (env var)       | Default FLOWX.AI value (can be overwritten) |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_INDEX\_OUT | ai.flowx.dev.core.index.process.v1          |
For more details please check the following section:
[Process Instance Indexing through Kafka transport](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing)
#### New service account
Added a new service account `flowx-process-engine-sa`. This service account is needed so the use of Start Catch Event node is possible.
[Service accounts](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#process-engine-service-account)
### Events gateway
Added a new **events-gateway** microservice, which requires the following configuration.
The events-gateway is designed specifically for handling events. Previously, each [**process-engine**](../../docs/terms/flowxai-process-engine) pod had a WebSocket (WS) server, and the front-end (FE) would connect to the process-engine to receive messages.
Now, instead of a server holding the messages, they are stored in Redis. However, the process-engine sends the messages to the events-gateway, which is responsible for sending them to Redis. Users connect to the events-gateway using an HTTP request and wait for Server-Sent Events (SSE) to flow in that request. They keep the request open for as long as they want SSE on a specific instance.
### Events-gateway kafka topics
New Kafka topics have been added for the events-gateway. These topics are used to send and receive messages between the events-gateway and the process-engine.
| Topic Name                                     | Description                                               | Value                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_EVENTS\_GATEWAY\_OUT\_MESSAGE    | Outgoing messages from process-engine to events-gateway   | ai.flowx.eventsgateway.engine.commands.message.v1    |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_EVENTS\_GATEWAY\_OUT\_DISCONNECT | Disconnect commands from process-engine to events-gateway | ai.flowx.eventsgateway.engine.commands.disconnect.v1 |
| KAFKA\_TOPIC\_EVENTS\_GATEWAY\_OUT\_CONNECT    | Connect commands from process-engine to events-gateway    | ai.flowx.eventsgateway.engine.commands.connect.v1    |
New kafka topics that should be added in the events-gateway configuration.
| Topic Name                                                       | Description                                                   | Value                                                |

### SSE
<Warning>
Starting with the 3.3 platform release, the WebSocket protocol has been removed. Therefore, if you are using `socket.io-client`, you will need to make some changes. Here's what you should do:
</Warning>
1. Uninstall `socket.io-client`:
Before proceeding, ensure that you uninstall `socket.io-client` from your project. You can do this using the following command:
```bash
npm uninstall socket.io-client
```
2. Install `event-source-polyfill@1.0.31`:
To replace the functionality provided by socket.io-client, you will need to use a new package called `event-source-polyfill@1.0.31` (as mentioned in the [**Installing the library**](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/renderer-sdks/angular-renderer#installing-the-library) section). This package serves as a polyfill for the EventSource API, which enables servers to send events to clients over HTTP. The EventSource API is commonly used for server-sent events (SSE) and real-time web applications.
```bash
npm install event-source-polyfill@1.0.31
```
### Message events
#### Topics related to message events

Buckle up, hold on tight, and prepare for an extraordinary experience! 🚀
## **New features** 🆕
### New nodes: message events
Message events play a crucial role in integrating messaging capabilities within business process modeling. These [**events**](../../docs/terms/events) are specifically crafted to capture the interaction between different participants in a [**process**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process) by referencing messages. By leveraging message events, processes can temporarily halt their execution until the anticipated messages are received, facilitating efficient coordination and communication among [**process instances**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-instance).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/node/all_message_events.png)
* **Message Throw Intermediate Event** - the events can be triggered at any time while the associated task is being performed
* **Interrupting event** - when the message is received, the user task is finished and the [**token**](../../docs/terms/token) advances in the process flow
* **Non-Interrupting event** - when messages are received, the user task, to which the catching boundary event is attached, is not finished immediately.
* **Message Catch Intermediate Event** - waits for a message to catch before continuing with the process flow
* **Message Catch Start Event** - starts an instance after receiving a message
[Message events](../../docs/building-blocks/node/message-events)
### 📢 Announcement: Transitioning from WebSockets to SSE (Server-Sent Events)
We are replacing WebSockets with SSE (Server-Sent Events) as the preferred technology for real-time communication in our system. SSE offers a lightweight and efficient solution for delivering server-initiated updates to the clients, enhancing the responsiveness and user experience.
With SSE, we can streamline the communication flow by eliminating the need for bidirectional channels. Instead, the server can send events directly to the clients, reducing network overhead and simplifying the implementation. SSE is built on top of the HTTP protocol, making it widely supported and easily integrable into existing systems.
Check the deployment guildelines for more information about the impact on the configs:
[SSE](deployment-guidelines-v3.3.0#sse)
### Events gateway
Added a new [**FLOWX.AI microservice**](../../docs/terms/microservices). The Events Gateway is a central communication service that processes and distributes SSE (Server-sent events) messages from Backend to Frontend. It acts as an intermediary between different system components, handling event processing, message distribution, and event publication. By reading messages from a Kafka topic and publishing events to the frontend renderer, it enables real-time updates in the user interface. Additionally, it integrates with Redis to publish events on a stream for other system components to consume. The Events Gateway ensures efficient event handling and facilitates seamless communication within the system.

[Events gateway](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/events-gateway)
[Events gateway setup guide](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/events-gateway-setup)
### Process engine
#### NEW: process instance indexing through Kafka transport
Sending data through **Kafka** : Rather than sending data directly from the process engine to ElasticSearch (ES), a new strategy is introduced where the [**process engine**](../../docs/terms/flowxai-process-engine) sends messages to a Kafka topic whenever there is something to be indexed from a [**process instance**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-instance). [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) is configured to read these messages and send them to ElasticSearch for indexing. This approach allows for fire-and-forget communication, eliminating the need for the process engine to wait for indexing requests to complete.
[Process instance indexing](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing)
#### KafkaConnect ElasticSearch sink plugin
A new component, Kafka Connect with configuration, has been added. This component enables Kafka Connect to listen to a specific topic where process instances generate messages and sends them to ElasticSearch indexes. The configuration includes the utilization of a KafkaConnect ElasticSearch sink connector plugin, which is responsible for handling this task. The plugin is configured with a connector.
[Example configuration for applying the solution with Kafka Connect](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing#example-configuration-for-applying-the-solution-with-kafka-connect)
Check the deployment guidelines for version 3.3:
[Kafka transport](./deployment-guidelines-v3.3.0#process-engine)
### UI Designer ✍️
#### Dynamic values
Added the possibility to add dynamic values in various element settings. You can now use process parameters or [**substitution tags**](../../docs/terms/flowx-substitutions-tags) for the following element properties: default value (excluding switch), label, placeholder, helpertext, error message, prefix, and suffix. Additionally, dynamic values are supported for specific elements such as [**Document Preview**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/file-preview), [**Card**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/card), [**Form**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements), Message, [**Button**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), [**Upload**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons), [**Select**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field), [**Checkbox**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/checkbox-form-field), [**Radio**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/radio-form-field), [**Segmented button**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/segmented-button), Text, Link, Modal, and Step. This enhancement allows for greater flexibility and customization.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/dynamic_val.gif)
#### Computed values
Computed values are dynamically generated or calculated values based on JavaScript expressions instead of static predefined values.
Computed values can be created using the [**UI Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-ai-ui-designer) by writing JavaScript expressions that operate on process parameters or other variables within the application. These expressions can perform calculations, transformations, or other operations to generate the desired value at runtime. By enabling computed values, the application provides flexibility and the ability to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/computed.gif)
[Dynamic & computed values](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/dynamic-and-computed-values)
#### New value slider UI element
Introducing a new slider UI element that allows users to select and adjust numerical values within a specified range. The slider element can be added under a parent form element by dragging and dropping or pasting.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/slider_release.gif)
#### Icons
The new Icons feature enhances the visual appeal and customization options for the following UI components: [**Input**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field), [**Select**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/select-form-field) and [**Button**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/buttons).
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/icons_release.png)
* Added support for customizing icons in UI elements by uploading and managing SVG files through the [Media Library](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/media-library)
* Improved UI Designer integration for easy icon customization.
* Introduced options to set colors for icons in UI Designer
* Enhanced icon management with the ability to mark SVG files as icons in the Media Library
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/iconss.png)
For more information, check the following section:
[Media Library](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/media-library#icons)
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
#### Document Plugin
* Fixed an issue that caused an error when splitting PDF documents without a barcode on the first page.
#### Admin
* Addressed an issue that resulted in the creation of duplicate processes with the same UUID when cloning and renaming a published process. Now, a new UUID is generated for the renamed process, ensuring uniqueness and preventing duplication.
#### Integrations
* Fixed an issue where the received message in the callback action, configured with parameters from integration, was incorrectly saved on the node ID instead of the configured key. The fix ensures that integrations correctly map the received message to the intended key, saving it in the intended location.
#### Task Manager
* Resolved an issue where processes started with the "inherit" option did not connect to the correct namespace when opened from the task manager. Subprocesses now establish the connection using the appropriate contextInstanceUuid from the Child Process, ensuring they connect to the correct namespace and receive the expected updates.
:::caution
Currently the two triggers lacks support for Service Level Agreement (SLA) functionality.

## **Changed** 🛠️
### Task Management - Bulk updates
Now you have the ability to send bulk update requests on [**Kafka**](../../docs/terms/flowx-kafka). You can now perform multiple operations at once.
[Bulk updates](./deployment-guidelines-v3.3.0#bulk-updates)
### Data model
#### Viewing data model references
This update introduces the ability to view attribute usage within the process. You can now easily see where a specific attribute is being used by accessing the "View References" feature. This feature provides a list of process data keys associated with each attribute and displays possible references, such as UI Elements.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/data_model_reference.gif)
<Info>
Please note that the option to view references is not available for object and array attribute types.

<Warning>
To ensure smooth upgrading to the v3.3 platform release and to automatically link already existing data models, please execute the following command:
```shell
curl --location --request PATCH '{{baseUrl}}/api/internal/ui-templates/data-model/link' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' \
--data ''
```
<Check>
Please replace `{{baseUrl}}` with the appropriate base URL for your platform.
</Check>
<Info>
Make sure to execute this command with the necessary permissions and valid authorization token to ensure a successful upgrade process: `manage-processes` and `admin`. For more information about the needed roles and scopes, check the [<u>**Configuring access rights for Admin**</u>](../../docs/flowx-designer/designer-setup-guide/configuring-access-rights-for-admin) section.
</Info>
</Warning>
#### Reporting
* You can now set "Used in reporting" and “Sensitive data” flags for an object or array of objects (all the child attributes will inherit its value - "true" or "false"), without the need to edit each attribute
#### Copy-paste objects
* Copy-paste objects structure under data model
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/data_model_reference.gif)
### Platform
#### Set client and environment
To configure the client and environment settings in the platform, you can use the following environment variables:
* `FLOWX_CLIENT_NAME`
* `FLOWX_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`
Both configurations must be set for the admin component to retrieve them. In case the environment variables are not overridden, the administrator can manually configure them in FLOWX Designer. Here's how you can do it:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/set_client_and_env.gif)
By setting the appropriate values for these environment variables, you ensure that the platform is correctly configured with the desired client and environment settings.
### Process designer
#### Swimlanes interaction
* We have introduced a new and improved way to interact with process swimlanes by incorporating a contextual menu.
Check out the animation below to see the new swimlanes interaction.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/building-blocks/swimlanes_docs.gif)
### Other
* The autoarrange function has been removed from [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Known issues** 🙁
* **Slider UI element**: Currently, there is an issue where the value thumb of a slider component does not display the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Business rules**: Presently, there is an issue where changing the language of a [**business rule**](../../docs/terms/business-rules) does not result in its execution using the new language. Despite updating the language value in the database, the business rule continues to be executed with the original language, leading to unexpected behavior.
* **Process Designer**:
* In certain cases, deleting a boundary node in the process designer and navigating back to the [**process designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer) from the [**UI Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-ai-ui-designer) does not remove the associated sequence from the boundary event. This issue specifically occurs when the sequence is linked to the deleted boundary node.
* Select Sequence buttons in the nodes UI interface may overlap.
* There is a known issue where users are unable to select the node name with the mouse in the user interface.
* **Plugins**: Reporting plugin is not compatible with Oracle DBs.

# Additional configuration
This section outlines the supplementary configurations required to leverage the newly introduced features within FLOWX.AI.
## Data Model Update Procedure
<Warning>
When deploying the new version, it's mandatory to migrate the data model index using the following procedure.
</Warning>
Follow the next steps:
1. **Access Kibana**: Start by connecting to Kibana and locate the data model index, which is typically named "process-data-model."
2. **Open Kibana Devtools**: Navigate to Kibana → Devtools. In the Console tab, you should proceed with the following steps.
3. **Check Index Documents**: Copy and paste the following script into the left-hand window, replacing any existing content, and then execute it. This script will retrieve the existing documents in the index to validate that the index name is correct.
```json
GET process-data-model/_search
{
"query": {
"match_all": {}
}
}
```
4. **Update Documents**: Replace any existing content in the left window with the following script, and then run it. This script updates the documents in the index by adding a new attribute, "processDefinitionVersionId," with the same value as "processDefinitionId."
```json
POST process-data-model/_update_by_query?wait_for_completion=false
{
"query": {
"match_all": {}
},
"script": {
"source": "ctx._source.processDefinitionVersionId=ctx._source.processDefinitionId",
"lang": "painless"
}
}
```
5. **Verify the Update**: Re-run the script from step 3 to confirm that the new attribute, "processDefinitionVersionId," has been added with the same value as "processDefinitionId."
These steps will ensure a smooth migration of the data model index when deploying the new version.
## Access rights for Fonts
In order to utilize the new fonts feature in the CMS microservice, it's mandatory to configure the following access rights:
| Module        | Scope  | Role default value   | Microservice       |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| manage-themes | import | ROLE\_THEMES\_IMPORT | Content Management |
|               | import | ROLE\_THEMES\_EDIT   | Content Management |
|               | import | ROLE\_THEMES\_ADMIN  | Content Management |
| manage-themes | read   | ROLE\_THEMES\_READ   | Content Management |
|               | read   | ROLE\_THEMES\_EDIT   | Content Management |
|               | read   | ROLE\_THEMES\_ADMIN  | Content Management |
|               | read   | ROLE\_THEMES\_IMPORT | Content Management |

|               | edit   | ROLE\_THEMES\_ADMIN  | Content Management |
| manage-themes | admin  | ROLE\_THEMES\_ADMIN  | Content Management |
## Markdown support
New lib added:
* `marked@^5.0.0` refers to a specific version of the "marked" library or package in the npm ecosystem. "marked" is an open-source JavaScript library used for parsing and rendering Markdown text into HTML.
To install the lib please make sure to run the following command:
`npm install marked@^5.0.0`
## Timer events
Incorporating new Kafka Topics and Consumer Groups.
### Admin
1. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_SCHEDULED\_TIMER\_EVENTS\_OUT\_SET**:
* Facilitates the transmission of scheduled message requests from the Admin microservice to the Scheduler.
* Utilize when setting up scheduled messages for precise timing and orchestration.
2. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_SCHEDULED\_TIMER\_EVENTS\_OUT\_STOP**:
* Responsible for forwarding requests from the Admin microservice to the Scheduler to halt scheduled messages.
* Utilize to cease previously scheduled messages for streamlined management.
3. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_START\_FOR\_EVENT\_IN**:
* Enabling the initiation of process definitions that commence with a timer start event node.
* Aids in the launch of process flows driven by time-based triggers.
### Scheduler
1. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_SCHEDULED\_TIMER\_EVENTS\_IN\_SET**:
* Receives scheduled message setting requests from the Admin and Process engine microservices.
* Utilized for setting up precise message scheduling with a focus on timing accuracy.
2. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_SCHEDULED\_TIMER\_EVENTS\_IN\_STOP**:
* Handles requests from the Admin and Process engine microservices to terminate scheduled messages.
* Essential for promptly halting scheduled messages according to operational requirements.
3. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_AUDIT\_OUT**:
* Introduction of audit functionality to the Scheduler microservice through Kafka.
* Enables tracking and management of scheduling activities.
New consumer groups:
```yaml
kafka:
consumer:
threads: 1
scheduled-timer-events:
threads: 1
group-id: scheduled-timer-events
stop-scheduled-timer-events:
threads: 1
group-id: stop-scheduled-timer-events
```
### Process engine
1. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_SCHEDULED\_TIMER\_EVENTS\_OUT\_SET**:
* Sent to the scheduler for setting scheduled messages.
2. **KAFKA\_TOPIC\_PROCESS\_SCHEDULED\_TIMER\_EVENTS\_OUT\_STOP**:
* Sent to the scheduler for stopping scheduled messages.
New consumer groups:
```yaml
kafka:
consumer:
threads: 1
scheduled-timer-events:
threads: 1
group-id: scheduled-timer-events
stop-scheduled-timer-events:
threads: 1
group-id: stop-scheduled-timer-events
```
### New service account
A new service account has been introduced. This service account is essential for enabling the usage of the Start Timer Event node. Detailed information is available in the following section:
[Service accounts](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/access-management/configuring-an-iam-solution#scheduler-service-account)
## Scheduler: New timer-event-scheduler (Cron)
Introducing a new timer event scheduler designed to manage timer events. This scheduler scans for expired messages every second, processing batches of 100 messages per iteration. For situations with higher message volumes, the scheduler ensures thorough message consumption:
```yaml
timer-event-scheduler:
batchSize: 100
cronExpression: "*/1 * * * * *" #every 1 seconds
```
## Scheduler: new recovery mechanism
```yaml
flowx:
timer-calculator:
delay-max-repetitions: 1000000
```
<Info>
You have a "next execution" set for 10:25, and the cycle step is 10 minutes. If the instance goes down for 2 hours, the next execution time should be 12:25, not 10:35. To calculate this, you add 10 minutes repeatedly to 10:25 until you reach the current time. So, it would be 10:25 + 10 min + 10 min + 10 min, until you reach the current time of 12:25. This ensures that the next execution time is adjusted correctly after the downtime.
</Info>
* `FLOWX_TIMER_CALCULATOR_DELAY_MAX_REPETITIONS` - This means that, for example, if our cycle step is set to one second and the system experiences a downtime of two weeks, which is equivalent to 1,209,600 seconds, and we have the "max repetitions" set to 1,000,000, it will attempt to calculate the next schedule. However, when it reaches the maximum repetitions, an exception is thrown, making it impossible to calculate the next schedule. As a result, the entry remains locked and needs to be rescheduled. This scenario represents a critical case where the system experiences extended downtime, and the cycle step is very short (e.g., 1 second), leading to the inability to determine the next scheduled event.

### Fresh nodes: Timer Events
These nodes enable you to trigger specific actions or events at predefined time intervals, durations, or cycles. With timer event nodes, you can design processes that respond to time-related conditions, ensuring smoother workflow execution and enhanced automation.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/timer_events.png)
Three primary Timer Event node types:
* [**Timer Start Event**](/3.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-start-event) (interrupting/non-interrupting)
* [**Timer Intermediate Event**](/3.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-intermediate-event)
* [**Timer Boundary Event**](/3.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-boundary-event) (interrupting/non-interrupting)
So whether it's reminders, recurring tasks, or tasks with deadlines, these Timer Event nodes are your go-to for keeping things in sync with the clock.
[Timer Events](/3.x/docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events)
### FLOWX.AI Designer
#### Font Management
Font Management allows you to upload and manage multiple font files, which can be later utilized when configuring UI templates using the UI Designer. You can now upload multiple TTF font files, the platform will identify additional data like font family, weight, and style for each file. That can be done using the new menu entry added under **Content Management > Font files**.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/fonts.png)
[Font Management](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/content-management/font-files)

* To copy selected nodes, use "CMD/Ctrl + C," and to paste them into a selected swimlane, use "CMD/Ctrl + V."
* To delete selected node(s), press "Backspace."
#### Data model
* Revamped Object-Level Settings with Enhanced Attribute Flags.
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release34/data_model_obj.png)
### Other Bits
* Bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our [**business rule**](../../docs/terms/business-rules) have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Timer Events**:
* Our timer events can sometimes be a bit shy and not show up on the canvas when added after creating a new process version or branch. They need a little nudge to make their appearance after refreshing the page.
* Mandatory Fields Error Messages: Our system has a sense of humor when it comes to mandatory fields. It forgets to deliver the error messages when these fields are left empty. It's a bit too laid-back.
* Timer Expression Validators: Our timer expressions can be a bit wild and free-spirited because they don't always follow the rules. We haven't implemented their validators yet, so they do as they please.
* Timer Events on Read-Only Process Versions: Our timer events are a bit of a rebel when it comes to read-only process versions. They refuse to disable their fields, as if they have a mind of their own.
* **Versioning**:
* Our versioning system can be a bit finicky at times. It might throw a server error when merging branches or refuse to ignore the Flowx UUID key, causing conflicts. And sometimes, the branching graph prefers to play hide-and-seek during import/export. But hey, we're working on it!
* Swimlane Allocation UI: Even after a process definition is deleted, you might catch a glimpse of the UI for swimlane allocation. It's like a ghost from the past that refuses to fade away.

<Warning>
With the release of **FLOWX.AI 3.0**, there have been some changes that you need to be aware when upgrading to the latest version:
* The `flowx-process-renderer` has been migrated to `@flowx\ui-sdk`.
* As of **FLOWX.AI 4.0**, the `paperflow-web-components` library will be deprecated. Instead, the new components can be found in `@flowx/ui-toolkit`.

# Additional configuration
This section outlines the supplementary configurations required to leverage the newly introduced features within FLOWX.AI (for a smooth transition please check first what's new in [3.4.0](../v3.4.0-september-2023/v3.4.0-september-2023.md)).
## Scheduler configuration
```yaml
scheduler:
thread-count: 30  # Configure the number of threads to be used for sending expired messages.
callbacks-thread-count: 60 # Configure the number of threads for handling Kafka responses, whether the message was successfully sent or not
cronExpression: "*/10 * * * * *" #every 10 seconds
retry: # new retry mechanism
max-attempts: 3
seconds: 1
thread-count: 3
cronExpression: "*/10 * * * * *" #every 10 seconds
cleanup:
cronExpression: "*/25 * * * * *" #every 25 seconds
```
### Explanation
* `SCHEDULER_THREAD_COUNT` - Used to configure the number of threads to be used for sending expired.
* `CALLBACKS_THREAD_COUNT` - Used to configure the number of threads for handling Kafka responses, whether the message was successfully sent or not.
### New retry mechanism
* `SCHEDULER_RETRY_THREAD_COUNT` - Specify the number of threads to use for resending messages that need to be retried.
* `SCHEDULER_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` - This configuration parameter sets the number of retry attempts. For instance, if it's set to 3, it means that the system will make a maximum of three retry attempts for message resending.
* `SCHEDULER_RETRY_SECONDS` - This configuration parameter defines the time interval, in seconds, for retry attempts. For example, when set to 1, it indicates that the system will retry the operation after a one-second delay.

## Revised Cache Key Organization
To ensure a smooth transition for the **3.4.1** release, it is crucial to make use of the clear cache endpoint with the following request body:
**Request:**
```http
POST /api/internal/cache/clear
```
<Info>
This endpoint is designed to purge Redis caches selectively. It will exclusively delete caches that are specified in the admin microservice properties under the property key: "application.redis.clearable-caches".
</Info>
Request body:
```json
{
"cacheNames": [
"events",
"admin",
"allowedSwimlanes",
"initiatedProcessFromStartEvent",
"flowx:core"
]
}
```
<Warning>
Please take note that after upgrading to the new system version, you should refrain from including the flowx:core cache in the request body when invoking the clear cache endpoint to avoid unintended consequences.
</Warning>
# v3.4.1 September 2023
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.1-september-2023/v3.4.1-september-2023
Welcome to the FLOWX.AI v3.4.1 patch release! In this update, we've fine-tuned your FLOWX.AI experience with fixes and enhancements. While it may not be a major version update, it's packed with valuable improvements.
## **What's new**
### Scheduler Configuration
* We've introduced a new configuration for the Scheduler microservice. Learn more in our [<u>**deployment guidelines**</u>](./deployment-guidelines-v3.4.1.md#scheduler-configuration).
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
### Timer Events
* **Fixed Timer Events Shyness**
* We've given our timer events a little nudge, and they will now reliably appear on the canvas after refreshing the page.
* **Resolved Mandatory Fields Error Messages**
* Our system has become more serious about mandatory fields and will now consistently display error messages when required fields are empty.
* **Improved Timer Expression Validators**
* We've implemented validators for timer expressions, ensuring they follow the rules as expected.
* **Fixed Timer Events in Read-Only Process Versions**
* Timer events will now behave appropriately and disable their fields in read-only process versions.
### Versioning
* **Enhanced Versioning System**
* We've made significant improvements to the versioning system to resolve these issues. Branch merging and UUID handling have been optimized, and the branching graph now consistently appears during import/export operations.
### Swimlane allocation
* **Removed Lingering UI After Process Definition Deletion**
* We've cleared away this lingering UI, so you won't encounter remnants of deleted process definitions in the swimlane allocation interface anymore.
### Revised Cache Key Organization
* Check the deployment guidelines for more information:
[Revised Cache Key Organization](deployment-guidelines-v3.4.1#revised-cache-key-organization)
### Other Bits
* Bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the **Process Designer**.
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
## **Additional information**
For deployment guidelines, refer to:
[Deployment guidelines v3.4.1](./deployment-guidelines-v3.4.1)
# Deployment guidelines v3.4.2
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.2-october-2023/deployment-guidelines-v3.4.2
<Info>
Do not forget, when upgrading to a new platform version, always ensure that your installed component versions match the versions specified in the release notes. To verify this, navigate to **FLOWX.AI Designer > Platform Status**.
</Info>
<Warning>
After updating to **3.4.2** FLOWX.AI release, it is not possible to import old process definitions into the new platform release (available for exports from releases **\< 3.4.2**).

# Additional configuration
## Designer values configuration
New environment variable
* `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION`: false (default value) - Set this to `true` only for HTTP versions \< 2 in order for SSE to work properly. Can be omitted otherwise.
# v3.4.2 October 2023
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.2-october-2023/v3.4.2-october-2023
Welcome to the FLOWX.AI v3.4.2 patch release! This update brings several enhancements and fixes to improve your FLOWX.AI experience. While it may not be a major version update, it's packed with valuable improvements.
## **What's new**
### Web Renderer - Enhanced SSE Connection Handling
* Introducing the `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION` variable: When set to `true`, it will automatically disconnect the Server-Sent Events (SSE) tab when it becomes inactive, and then seamlessly reconnect and retrieve the status when it becomes active. By default, `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION` is set to `false`, meaning there will be no SSE disconnection when switching tabs, ensuring a smoother user experience.
<Warning>
Set `LEGACY_HTTP_VERSION` to `true` only for HTTP versions \< 2 to ensure proper SSE functionality. It can be omitted for other cases.
</Warning>
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
* Addressed various bugs from previous versions to enhance stability and reliability.
### Other Bits
* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
* **Text Element Issue**: Our text element tends to vanish when set to "0" or "-". Expected it to show up, but it's playing hide-and-seek instead!

# v3.4.3 October 2023
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.3-october-2023/v3.4.3-october-2023
In FLOWX.AI version 3.4.3, we've addressed several bugs to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release.
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
### Notification and Document plugins
* Fixed limited entries problem in Document plugin and Notification plugin, previously restricted to 20 entries.
* Resolved the issue causing the Document plugin to restart when starting with lag in Kafka topics.
### Web SDK
* Addressed CSS class assignment for `<flx-text>` issue, ensuring correct class assignment.
* Fixed a UI issue where adding a left margin to COLLECTION\_PROTOTYPE caused it to extend beyond the parent card.
* Corrected a bug in certain UI elements where selecting a 2nd level child value didn't clear when the parent value was updated.
* Resolved rendering issues for '0' and '-' values in text elements.
### Designer and Versioning
* Fixed the Designer issue where options in certain UI elements weren't displayed in dropdowns after previous selections.
* Resolved the Import Published Version Selection issue during process import, now displaying only available versions.
### Admin
* Fixed an issue that previously prevented the creation of new versions for processes with swimlane names containing empty spaces.
## **Other Bits**
* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.

# v3.4.4 November 2023
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.4-november-2023/v3.4.4-november-2023
In version 3.4.4 of FLOWX.AI, we have addressed some issues to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release:
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
### FLOWX.AI Engine 🚂
* Fixed an issue where sending an extra key when using [**bulk operations**](../../docs/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide#topics-related-to-the-task-management-plugin) was not working as expected. Now you can attach extra keys to the header and they will be copied to the response. See the example below:
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/platform-deep-dive/bulk_requestid.png)
### Web SDK
* Fixed a small performance issue
## **Other Bits**
* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
## **Additional information**

# v3.4.5 November 2023
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.5-november-2023/v3.4.5-november-2023
In version 3.4.5 of FLOWX.AI, we have addressed some issues to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release:
## **Changed** 🛠️
### Process Versioning
* **Delete process definition** - After deleting or renaming a process definition, you can now add a new one with the same name, whether manually or through import, without any limitations or constraints.
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
### Versioning
* Our version control got tangled in a game of interdimensional hopscotch, leaving branches stranded without their past travel tickets. We've straightened out the interdimensional portals now, ensuring that branches maintain their historical travel logs. No more lost branches in the space-time continuum!
### Web SDK
* **UI Designer** - We trained our containers in the art of origami, hoping they'd master the art of rearranging themselves gracefully. Unfortunately, they got carried away with their newfound skill and refused to listen when asked to reorder themselves properly. **We've had a serious talk with them, and now they promise to behave! You can copy, paste, and rearrange containers without them folding into chaos.**
## **Other Bits**
* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.

# v3.4.6 December 2023
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.6-december-2023/v3.4.6-december-2023
In version 3.4.6 of FLOWX.AI, we have addressed some issues to improve the stability and reliability of the platform. Here are the key bug fixes in this release:
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
### Process Designer
* Cured a case of the "Start-Subprocess Stumper": now configuring existing start subprocess actions is a breeze! No more invisible barriers.
### Process Engine
* Liberated process versioning on Oracle from its migration woes! No more version control drama, it's all harmonious now.
* Put an end to the confusion: JavaScript arrays will no longer masquerade as Java maps. They've embraced their true identities.
* Our token instance ID DB index on Oracle has been reincarnated! It’s back and better than ever, ready to keep track of those elusive tokens.
### Versioning
* Put an end to the process definition merge branch mayhem! No more tangled branches, just clean, pristine definitions merging like old friends at a reunion.
## **Other Bits**
* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.

## Additional Configuration
### Process Engine
Introducing a new environment variable designed to facilitate the coordinated or independent expiration of subprocesses within a parent process.
| Environment Variable                | Default Value | Explanation                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FLOWX_PROCESS_EXPIRE_SUBPROCESSES` | true          | When set to true, expiration of a parent process triggers simultaneous expiration of all associated subprocesses |
For further details, refer to the documentation [**here**](../../3.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/engine-setup#managing-subprocesses-expiration).
### Documents Plugin
The DPI value for the PDF to JPEG conversion can now be configured via the `FLOWX_CONVERT_DPI` environment variable.
| Environment Variable | Default Value | Explanation                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FLOWX_CONVERT_DPI`  | 150           | Sets the DPI (dots per inch) for PDF to JPEG conversion. Higher values result in higher resolution images. |
For further details, refer to the documentation [**here**](../../3.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/documents-plugin-setup#conversion).
### OCR Plugin
The following environment variables were introduced to control the acceptable aspect ratio range for recognizing signed documents in OCR processes. Here's a brief description of each:
| Environment Variable      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `OCR_SIGNATURE_MAX_RATIO` | This variable sets the maximum acceptable aspect ratio for a signed scanned document (the OCR plugin will recognize a signature only if the document ratio is greater than or equal to the specified minimum ratio)                              | `1.43`        |
| `OCR_SIGNATURE_MIN_RATIO` | This variable sets the minimum acceptable aspect ratio for a signed scanned document (in this context, the OCR plugin will consider a detected signature only if the document aspect ratio is less than or equal to the specified maximum ratio) | `1.39`        |
<Info>
The plugin has been tested with aspect ratio values between 1.38 and 1.43. However, caution is advised when using untested values outside this range, as they may potentially disrupt the functionality. Adjust these parameters at your own risk and consider potential consequences, as untested values might lead to plugin instability or undesired behavior.
</Info>
For further details, refer to the documentation [**here**](../../3.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/ocr-plugin-setup#control-aspect-ratio).
# v3.4.7 January 2024
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.7-january-2024/v3.4.7-january-2024
Welcome to the FLOWX.AI v3.4.7 patch release! This update brings several enhancements and fixes to improve your FLOWX.AI experience. While it may not be a major version update, it's packed with valuable improvements.
## **What's new**
### Process Engine 🚂
#### 🆕 **Default Data Transmission to Frontend (Improvement)**
In version 3.4.7 of the FLOWX.AI Platform, we're introducing a practical improvement related to sending data to the frontend. This enhancement aims to simplify the process of displaying process data in the frontend UI, reducing the time and effort required for configuration.
###### Background
Previously, the Configurator required explicit mention of objects to be sent to the frontend for displaying data in User Task UI. This often included configuring keys for various UI elements. To make this process more straightforward, we've implemented a default mechanism that automatically sends all keys configured as sources for UI elements to the frontend.
###### Changes and Benefits
To streamline the configuration process, we've made the following updates in the UI Configuration:
* **Label Change**: We've updated the label in the configuration UI under "Message" to "Custom UI Payload" for clarity.
* **Runtime Behavior (Default Data Transmission)**: During runtime, the Backend (BE) will automatically send to the frontend all data available as process variables with matching keys. This includes default keys and objects specified in the "Message" option of the root element for User Tasks.
* **Default Keys Sent to Frontend**: For various UI elements, predefined keys will be sent to the frontend by default.
#### 🆕 **Managing Subprocesses Expiration**
We introduced a new mechanism for precise control over subprocesses expiration.

### Documents Plugin 📄
🆕 **PDF to JPEG Conversion Improvement**
We have enhanced the PDF to JPEG conversion functionality. This improvement allows users to configure the DPI (dots per inch) value for converting PDFs to JPEG files, resulting in higher resolution images.
<Check>
Additional Configuration needed! Check the [**deployment guidelines**](deployment-guidelines-v3.4.7#additional-configuration).
</Check>
### OCR Plugin 👁️
🆕 **Control Aspect Ratio**
Introduced a mechanism to fine-tune the OCR by defining a range of acceptable aspect ratios for particular documents. Adjusting these ratios of the documents can help tailor the OCR plugin to different types of documents.

Additional Configuration needed! Check the [**deployment guidelines**](deployment-guidelines-v3.4.7#ocr-plugin).

### License Core
* Improved licensing core for a refined experience, ensuring improved functionality and ease of use.
## **Bug Fixes** 🔧
### Process Engine 🚂
#### Bug Fix: Subprocess Party Time 🎉
So, to make sure the subprocesses don't miss the farewell fireworks when the parent process expires, we've equipped them with a "Subprocess Farewell Dance Routine"! Now, when the parent process decides it's time to go, the subprocesses won't be hanging around like party crashers - they'll join the exit dance and wrap things up properly.
#### Bug Fix: Subprocess Timeout Tango - Interrupted Edition 💃🕰️
In the grand dance of subprocesses, we stumbled upon a partner who wasn't quite following the choreography. The bug report stated that subprocesses were not gracefully bowing out after an interrupting timer event. Now, when the timer says it's time to leave, the subprocesses won't be sticking around for an encore!
### Advancing Controller
#### Bug Fix: Parallel Advancing Ballet - Failure Recovery 🩰🐞
To ensure our parallel advancing ballet doesn't lose its rhythm, we've introduced the "Failure Recovery Pirouette." Now, when an advancing event faces failure, the partitions won't be left wondering if the music stopped—they'll gracefully exit the stage, and inactive partitions will automatically join the backstage crew, making room for the next act.
Thank you for being part of the FLOWX.AI Platform community, where even bugs are fixed with a twirl and a leap! 😄🩰🎭
## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** 🙁
Keep an eye out for these quirks:
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.

</Info>
## Additional Configuration
<Check>
Before upgrading to v3.4.8 version we recommend to execute the initial data partitioning setup manually. This is needed no matter if you enable partitioning or not.
Therefore, when starting the new version of the process-engine, we recommend manually executing the setup SQL commands from Liquibase, as they may take more time. After setup, all existing information will go into the initial partition.
</Check>
<Info>
If partitioning is enabled, the initial partition will continue to be used until a new `partition_id` is generated according to the partitioning interval (DAY, WEEK, MONTH). Future partitions will be created automatically.
If partitioning is not enabled, all data will continue to be stored in this initial partition.
</Info>
### Process instance data archiving

# v3.4.8 June 2024
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v3.x.x/v3.4.8-june-2024/v3.4.8-june-2024
Welcome to the FlowX.AI v3.4.8 patch release! This update brings several enhancements and fixes to improve your FlowX.AI experience. While it may not be a major version update, it's packed with valuable improvements.
## What's new? 🆕
### FlowX.AI Engine: Process Instance Data Archiving
<Info>
Database compatibility: Oracle DBs.
</Info>
We are introducing a new system for archiving data related to old process instances. This enables the implementation of data retention policies, with more predictable storage usage and costs.
<Tip>
Some operations involving process instance data can be snappier, given the lower amount of data in the system and new structure. Archiving relies on partitioning data based on the process instance start time. Each partition is associated with a time period (day, week, month), and retention is defined by the number of periods maintained in the system.
</Tip>
Archived data remains in new tables in the database, optionally compressed, and is no longer accessible in FlowX. These tables can be compressed, copied, moved, archived, or deleted without affecting other processes in FlowX.
For more details about process instance partitioning and archiving, including configuration of the feature, see:
<Card title="Process instance data archiving and partitioning" href="../../3.x/setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/process-instance-data-archiving" />
### Documents Plugin
Introducing configurable temporary file deletion strategy. Explore configuration details in the section below:
<Card title="Documents plugin setup guide" href="../../3.x/setup-guides/plugins-setup-guide/documents-plugin-setup#file-storage-configuration" />
## Bug Fixes 🛠️
We've also squashed pesky bugs to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience across the board:
### FlowX.AI Engine
* **Token stuck in END Parallel Gateway node 🚧**: We've cleared the traffic jam where tokens were stuck at the END parallel gateway node. Now, your processes will flow like a river, smooth and unstoppable!
* **Process Continuation Issue**: Fixed an issue where processes started in version 2.14 couldn't time travel to version 3.4.x. Trying to advance these processes caused errors or made them vanish into the void. We've patched the timeline by updating the start swimlane ID in the database, so your processes can now journey safely to the future!
### FlowX.AI Admin
* **Process Version Memory Loss**: Fixed a bug where some process version params (like application ID, reporting usage, task manager usage, indexing keys, and application URL) mysteriously disappeared from old process definitions when importing a new version. We've given these params a memory boost, so they stick around like they should!
### FlowX.AI CMS
* **Lost in Translation**: Fixed an issue where languages were feeling a bit `null` and `void` in newly created environments. Instead of partying with an empty list like they should, they were sitting around with null values, causing chaos when trying to add new languages. Now, languages get the memo right away and initialize themselves properly.
* **Chill Media Library Search**: Updated the Media Library search so it no longer cares about upper or lower case. Now, whether you type in CAPS or whisper softly in lowercase, it'll find what you're looking for. No more sensitive searches, just chill browsing in the library!

# Deployment changes
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.0.0-april-2024/migrating-from-v3.4.x/migrating-from-v3.4.x
This document outlines the additional configuration changes required for deployment in version 4.0
### Revised cache key organization
To ensure a smooth transition to the 4.0 release, it's crucial to clear the cache before upgrading to v4.0. Use the following endpoint and request body for cache clearing:
<Check>
Ensure that this operation is carried out by a user with an admin role.
</Check>
##### Endpoint:
`POST {{baseUrlAdmin}}/api/internal/cache/clear`
##### Body:
```json
{
"cacheNames": [
"flowx:core:cache"
]
}
```
<Info>
This endpoint is designed to purge Redis caches selectively. It will exclusively delete caches that are specified in the admin microservice properties under the property key: "application.redis.clearable-caches".
</Info>
<Card title="Clear Cache 4.0" href="/4.0/docs/api/clear-cache4.0" icon="link" />
### Access rights for Theme Management

# Process configuration
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.0.0-april-2024/migrating-from-v3.4.x/process-configuration
This guide outlines changes in process and UI configuration from v3.4.x to 4.0 version.
In the latest version, there have been updates and adjustments to process and UI configurations to improve performance and usability. Below are the key changes and steps to migrate your configurations:
## Business Rules
* `output.put` method is required to generate structured output data when using input to validate or filter incoming data based on certain conditions (commonly used to retrieve information needed for processing)
* `processInstanceID` and `processInstanceUUID` - This release introduces enhancements aimed at isolating process instance related values from business/configured parameters. Key changes include the removal of `processInstanceId`, `parentProcessInstanceId`, and `parentProcessInstanceUuid` from paramValues zone on process instance, relocating them to a distinct location within process instance data - to a new object called “instanceMetadata”.
### Business rules - new object "instanceMetadata"
Introducing a new object named "instanceMetadata". This object will serve as a container for process instance related values, allowing you to access relevant attributes in your scripts more effectively. Key specifications include making certain variables/parameters read-only, controlled by FlowX, and facilitating attribute access through the `instanceMetadata` object rather than directly calling attributes.
<Info>
Configurators will utilize `instanceMetadata` to access attributes instead of directly calling them as in version 3.4.x. For example, `input.processInstanceId` will be accessed through `instanceMetadata.processInstanceId`.
</Info>
<Warning>
Review and update any affected business rules accordingly.
</Warning>
#### Example of business rule (with Python)
<Info>
This example is made just to demonstrate the use of the new `instanceMetadata.get` object.
</Info>
```python
test_string = "There are 2 apples for 4 persons"
# using List comprehension + isdigit() +split()
# getting numbers from string
res = [int(i) for i in test_string.split() if i.isdigit()]
output.put("app", {"phyton": str(res), "key3": "Value updated"});
key = input.get("app").get("key1")
id3 = instanceMetadata.get("processInstanceId")
uuid3 = instanceMetadata.get("processInstanceUuid")

## UI configuration
<Info>
There are some changes that were brought together with the Theme Management feature to the UI components in **4.0** release that might impact your previous UI configuration.
</Info>
### Root components
* **Card Element**: Previously (in **v3.4.x**) could have set a **Card style** property: **border** or be **raised**.
|                                              Card 4.0                                              |                                              Card 3.0                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <Frame>![Card 4.0](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/card4.0.png)</Frame> | <Frame>![Card 3.0](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/card3.0.png)</Frame> |
|                                                                                                    |                                                                                                    |
Now, for processes migrated from **v3.4.x** to achieve the previous styling (with "raised prop" or "border") you can either set up from Themes or by using **Theme Overrides** for **Card** element in **UI Designer**:
<Tip>
Depending on the number of Card elements present in your migrated processes, it's essential to devise a strategic approach. If a significant portion of the cards feature "border" styling, you can configure this setting within Themes Management and will be cascading through all of them. For the remaining cards, manual intervention is required to apply the "raised" effect by **overriding** their styles using **Theme Overrides**.

<Card title="Theme management" href="/4.0/docs/platform-deep-dive/core-extensions/content-management/themes" />
### Buttons
All **primary** and **secondary** buttons, in 4.x they transformed to **fill** buttons. If there were secondary buttons, once moved to "fill", they will appear similar to primary ones. You should perform an override in the UI Designer to make them look like secondary buttons as they did initially.
<Frame>

</Frame>
| Version | Primary | Secondary | Ghost | Text | Fill | New States: Pressed, Hover, Disabled |
| ------- | :-----: | :-------: | :---: | :--: | :--: | :----------------------------------: |
| 3.4.x   |    ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓   |   ✓  |      |                                      |
| 4.0.x   |         |           |   ✓   |   ✓  |   ✓  |                   ✓                  |
By following this migration guide, you can seamlessly transition to the Theming 4.0 feature, enhancing your project's design process and ensuring consistency across platforms and branches.
### Icons - no color property
<Info>
Now, all icon color settings have a "No Color" option, which allows the icon (SVG) to be rendered with its original color settings.
</Info>
If you are utilizing SVG icons for UI components (such as a left icon on an input element) and you desire to ensure that the color remains consistent regardless of the theme settings, it is imperative to override all states associated with the "Left icon," as demonstrated in the example below:
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/no_color_svg.png)
</Frame>
## Layout
In the context of the Theme Management feature, you can now apply the previously configured paddings directly from the previosuly used theme JSONs within the theme settings. Review the paddings you had set up previously and apply them in the Themes section.
**Themes → Global Settings → Styles**
### Components spacing
If you set it in **Theme → Global Settings**, it will cascade to all the following components:
* Input/ Selection
* Buttons
* Radio/Checkbox
* Message
* Segmentted Button
* Stepper
* Tabs
<Frame>
![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release40/theme_padding.gif)
</Frame>
<Tip>
If you want to override the padding set in **Global Settings** for the above components, navigate to **Components → Your Component** and set your desired padding.
</Tip>
<Info>
After editing the padding for a component, you can also reset the values and they will be set back to the values you added in **Global settings**.
</Info>
### Layout elements
To set the padding for layout elements( **Cards** and **Forms**), access:
**Themes → Components → Layout Elements**
# Renderer SDKs
Source: https://docs.flowx.ai/release-notes/v4.0.0-april-2024/migrating-from-v3.4.x/renderers
This guide assists in migrating from FlowX v3.4.x to v4.0.
## Web SDK migration guide
### Theming changes
<Warning>
All old configurations linked with the previous theming setup (versions prior to 4.0) must be removed from your SDK deployment:
</Warning>
1. Review Usage: Identify where you have applied theming v1 configurations in your project.
#### 3.4.x example:
```yaml
...
themePaths: {
components: 'assets/theme/theme_components.json',
tokens: 'assets/theme/theme_tokens.json',
...
},
```
2. Update to Theming 4.0: Revise your theming configurations to use the latest theming v2 approach. Refer to our documentation or migration resources for guidance on transitioning to the new theming.

### Authorization token
* **AuthToken Management**: The ui-sdk no longer relies on the authToken being stored in LOCAL\_STORAGE. Instead, the 'access\_token' is now passed as an input to the `<flx-process-renderer>` component through a private variable.
<Warning>
**Breaking change**: This update is mandatory for proper functionality of SSE (Server-Sent Events).
</Warning>
<Info>
By adopting this approach, clients gain the flexibility to implement the most secure token management strategy tailored to their specific security needs. Moreover, shifting the responsibility to the container application for updating the 'access\_token' input ensures that any changes or refreshes to the authToken are securely managed within the application's domain. This proactive approach effectively mitigates potential security vulnerabilities associated with token management, offering a robust and adaptable solution.

## iOS SDK migration guide
### Integration changes
The module name has changed from `FlowX` to `FlowXRenderer`.
Any files importing the SDK should be updated with the new module name.
```
//replace this
import FlowX
//with this
import FlowXRenderer
```
### Initialization config changes
A new configuration parameter, named `enginePath` was added to `FXConfig`. It represents the URL path component to the process engine.
```swift
FXConfig.sharedInstance.configure { (config) in
config.baseURL = myBaseURL
config.enginePath = "engine"
config.imageBaseURL = myImageBaseURL
config.language = "en"
config.logLevel = .verbose
}
```
### Theming changes
The theming setup mechanism was updated.

### Custom components
* The type of `data` property of custom components has changed from `[String: Any]` to `Any`.
* As a consequence, type checking, casting and extracting the needed data must be part of the implementation details of the custom component.
<Card title="Custom components" href="/4.0/sdks/ios-renderer#custom-components" icon="link">

## Android SDK migration guide
### Initialization config changes
A new configuration parameter, named `enginePath` was added for identifying the FlowX Process Engine microservice.
When the SDK initialization happens through the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` method, the argument has to be set inside the `config: SdkConfig` parameter value:
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(
...
config = SdkConfig(
baseUrl = "URL to FlowX backend",
imageBaseUrl = "URL to FlowX CMS Media Library",
enginePath = "some_path",
language = "en",
validators = mapOf("exact_25_in_length" to { it.length == 25 }),
),
...
)
```
### Authentication changes
The authentication mechanism has changed, so instead of passing the `String` value for the access token, a `FlowxSdkApi.Companion.AccessTokenProvider` must be used instead.
This provider is defined as a functional interface returning the actual value of the access token:
```kotlin
fun interface AccessTokenProvider {
fun get(): String
}
```
Related changes:
1. The provider can be passed if the business logic allows it when calling the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)`.
As a consequence, the new signature for the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` is:
```kotlin
fun init(
context: Context,
config: SdkConfig,
accessTokenProvider: AccessTokenProvider? = null,
customComponentsProvider: CustomComponentsProvider? = null,
)
```
2. The `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().startProcess(...)` `accessToken` parameter was dropped. It is not needed anymore, as the authentication will rely solely on the `AccessTokenProvider`.
The new signature of this method is:
```kotlin
fun startProcess(
processName: String,
params: JSONObject = JSONObject(),
isModal: Boolean = false,
closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```
3. The `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().continueProcess(...)` `accessToken` parameter was dropped. It is not needed anymore, as the authentication will rely solely on the `AccessTokenProvider`.
The new signature of this method is:
```kotlin
fun continueProcess(
processUuid: String,
isModal: Boolean = false,
closeModalFunc: ((processName: String) -> Unit)? = null,
): @Composable () -> Unit
```
4. The calls of the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().updateAccessToken("some_access_token")` method must be replaced by calls of the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().setAccessTokenProvider(accessTokenProvider = { "some_access_token" })`.
<Tip>
Whenever the access token changes based on your own authentication logic, it must be updated in the renderer by calling the `setAccessTokenProvider` method again.
</Tip>
<Card title="Authentication mechanism" href="/4.0/sdks/android-renderer#authentication" icon="link">

</Card>
### Theming changes
The theming mechanism was replaced by a new approach, which enforces loading a theme before starting or resuming a process.
Related changes:
1. The `ai.flowx.android.sdk.process.model.SdkConfig` theming related parameters (i.e. `themeTokensJsonFileAssetsPath` and `themeComponentsJsonFileAssetsPath`) were dropped.
Because of that, when configuring the library through the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(...)` method, the `config` parameter will look like this:
```kotlin
FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().init(
...
config = SdkConfig(
baseUrl = "URL to FlowX backend",
imageBaseUrl = "URL to FlowX CMS Media Library",
enginePath = "some_path",
language = "en",
validators = mapOf("exact_25_in_length" to { it.length == 25 }),
),
...
)
```
2. For styling the UI components displayed when rendering a process while authenticated, the `FlowxSdkApi.getInstance().setupTheme(...)` method must be called before starting or resuming any process:
```kotlin
suspend fun setupTheme(
themeUuid: String,
fallbackThemeJsonFileAssetsPath: String? = null,
@MainThread onCompletion: () -> Unit
)
```
This will fetch a priorly defined theme in the FlowX Designer, cache it and then load its properties.
A process should be started or resumed only after the `onCompletion` closure is called, signaling the completion of setting up the theme.

</Card>
### Custom components changes
1. All `import ai.flowx.android.sdk.component.*` directives must be changed to `import ai.flowx.android.sdk.ui.components.*`
2. The type of the `data` parameter passed to a custom component through the `populateUi(data: JSONObject)` method, both for `@Composable` and for classical `View` system approaches, changed to `Any?`.<br /><br />
Therefore, the new signature of the method is `populateUi(data: Any?)`.
As a consequence, type checking, casting and extracting the needed data must be part of the implementation details of the custom component.
<Tip>
The value for the `data` parameter received in the `populateUi(data: Any?)` could be:
* `Boolean`
* `String`
* `java.lang.Number`
* `org.json.JSONObject`
* `org.json.JSONArray`
