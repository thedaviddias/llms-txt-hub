In case you need a custom scenario or have propositions, feel free to reach
out at `support@screenshotone.com`.
</Alert>
You can rely on ScreenshotOne API to generate animated screenshots and handle image and video streaming infrastructure.
ScreenshotOne supports animated (including scrollable) screenshots of different types, caching based on the world’s fastest and most potent CDN (Cloudflare), blocking ads, cookie banners, and chats.
In just one API request, you can quickly generate animated screenshots. And if you need more, various scenarios with many options are covered.
Grasp how simple it is:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/animate?url=https://tailwindcss.com&scenario=scroll&access_key=<your access key>
```
The result might differ a bit in case default options are changed, but as for now, it is similar to what I have shown in the video:
<Video url="/videos/animated_screenshot.mp4" />
Don't forget that you can use [signed links to share videos and GIF images publicly](https://screenshotone.com/docs/signed-requests/), [caching](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#caching), [block ads](/docs/options/#block_ads), [block cookie banners](/docs/options/#block_cookie_banners), and [many other options](#all-supported-options).
## Scenarios
Select a basic scenario of how you want to animate screenshots or render ed HTML. Specify additional options and tune the scenario for your use case. And you are good to go.
### Default (stand still)
Use the `scenario=default` parameter, or don't specify `scenario` at all when sending a request to `/animate`.
The default scenario is to record animation after loading the site without additional animations.
The use case is when you generate animated screenshots of sites that have animations and you want to showcase it.
Look at [the Handwrytten site](https://www.handwrytten.com/) as an example. It has a default animation when loaded. So, we won't scroll it or add any other activities.
We will record the site as is after load:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/animate?url=https://www.handwrytten.com/&access_key=<your access key>
```
The result:
<Video url="/videos/animated_handwrytten.mp4" />
### Scrollable (scrolling) screenshot
Use the `scenario=scroll` parameter, or don't specify `scenario` at all when sending a request to `/animate`.
There is an example for scrolling [Senja](https://senja.io):
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/animate?url=https://senja.io&scenario=scroll&access_key=<your access key>
```
The result is:
<Video url="/videos/animated_senja.mp4" />
These are supported options for scrolling screenshot animation:
-   `scroll_delay`—delay in milliseconds between scrolls. The default value is `500`.
-   `scroll_duration`—duration in milliseconds of one scroll. The default value is `1500`. The scroll duration is not the duration of the video or animated GIF. Please, use the `duration` parameter to specify the length of the video or animated GIF.
-   `scroll_by`—by how many pixes scroll. The default value is `1000`.
-   `scroll_start_immediately`—scroll immediately or wait for the `scroll_delay` milliseconds before scrolling. The default value is `true`.
-   `scroll_start_delay`—wait time (in milliseconds) till starting scrolling. The default value is `0``.
-   `scroll_back`—scroll back or not. The default value is `true`.
-   `scroll_back_algorithm`—`once` is by default and means that it will scroll back immediately once with the easing you have defined. But if you set `repeat`, it will repeat the same algorithm the API used to scroll to the bottom of the page.
-   `scroll_back_after_duration`—scroll back after the specified duration in milliseconds.
-   `scroll_complete`—stop recording animation when full scrolling is completed. The option `true` by default.
-   `scroll_stop_after_duration`—stop scrolling after the specified duration in milliseconds. Use `scroll_complete=false` and `scroll_back=false`, to stop and just stand still after the specified duration.
-   `scroll_easing`—use it to define the scrolling easing effect. The default value is `ease_in_out_quint`. There is a list of all available options:
-   `linear`–no easing, no acceleration;
-   `ease_in_quad`–accelerating from zero velocity;
-   `ease_out_quad`–decelerating to zero velocity;
-   `ease_in_out_quad`–acceleration until halfway, then deceleration;
-   `ease_in_cubic`–accelerating from zero velocity;
-   `ease_out_cubic`–decelerating to zero velocity;
-   `ease_in_out_cubic`–acceleration until halfway, then deceleration;
-   `ease_in_quart`–accelerating from zero velocity;
-   `ease_out_quart`–decelerating to zero velocity;
-   `ease_in_out_quart`–acceleration until halfway, then deceleration;
-   `ease_in_quint`–accelerating from zero velocity;
-   `ease_out_quint`–decelerating to zero velocity;
-   `ease_in_out_quint`–acceleration until halfway, then deceleration.
-   `scroll_try_navigate`—navigate while scrolling and record the new opened page.
-   `scroll_navigate_after`—navigate after duration in milliseconds, by default it is half of the duration.
-   `scroll_navigate_to_url`—to what URL navigate;
-   `scroll_navigate_link_hints`—if the URL is not specified, the hints of what links to use, by default `'pricing', 'about', 'customers'`.  E.g. "pricing" means to open any internal link which has the "pricing" keyword in its text;
-   `scroll_till_selector`—scroll till the selector is visible;
-   `scroll_till_selector_adjust_top`—adjust the top position of the selector in the viewport;
-   `scroll_to_end_after`—scroll to the end after the specified duration in milliseconds with the specified easing in one scroll.
There is an example of applying custom options for scrolling [Senja](https://senja.io):
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/animate?url=https://senja.io&scenario=scroll&scroll_delay=400&scroll_by=400&access_key=<your access key>
```
The result is:
<Video url="/videos/animated_senja_custom.mp4" />
### Navigation
You can record a page navigation when recording scrolling screenshot video. It allows render less boring and more engaging videos.
<Video url="/videos/scrolling_screenshot_navigation.mp4" />
It is rendered with a simple request like:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/animate?url=https://screenshotone.com/&scenario=scroll&duration=10&scroll_try_navigate=true&scroll_navigate_link_hints=pricing&access_key=<YOUR KEY>
```
You need to specify either the "scroll_navigate_to_url" or the "scroll_navigate_link_hints" options.
If neither is specified, any first random visible internal link will be used for navigation if available.
The `scroll_navigate_link_hints` option can be used as an array:
```
scroll_navigate_link_hints[]=pricing&scroll_navigate_link_hints[]=about
```
The API will attempt to find any internal links that match the hints.
## All supported options
### Animation specific
#### format
Available response formats:
-   `mp4`
-   `mov`
-   `avi`
-   `webm`
-   `gif`
Default value is `mp4`.
#### duration
<Alert>
If you need a longer animation, please, reach out at
`support@screenshotone.com` and describe your use case.
</Alert>
The default value is `5` seconds (`duration=5`).
The minimum value is `1` and the maximum is `30`.
Suppose `scroll_complete` is set to `true`, which is by default, and [the scrolling scenario](/docs/animated-screenshots/#scrollable-scrolling-screenshot)) is completed earlier than the specified `duration`. In that case, the recording will be stopped, and the resulting animation will be short.
#### width
You must specify both the `width` and [height](#height) parameters. You can't specify only one. By default, the width and the height parameters are the same as [viewport width](/docs/options/#viewport_width) and [viewport height](/docs/options/#viewport_height) parameters.
[The device scale factor](/docs/options/#device_scale_factor) is taken into consideration. If you set the viewport width and height to `1000x500`, with `device_scale_factor=1`, the resulting resolution of the video will be `1000x500`, but with `device_scale_factor=2`, it will be `2000x1000`.
If [aspect ratio](#aspect_ratio) is specified, `width` and `height` are not used. And API will try to fit the video of the viewport size into the specified aspect ratio.
#### height
You must specify both the [width](#width) and `height` parameters. You can't specify only one. By default, the width and the height parameters are the same as [viewport width](/docs/options/#viewport_width) and [viewport height](/docs/options/#viewport_height) parameters.
[The device scale factor](/docs/options/#device_scale_factor) is taken into consideration. If you set the viewport width and height to `1000x500`, with `device_scale_factor=1`, the resulting resolution of the video will be `1000x500`, but with `device_scale_factor=2`, it will be `2000x1000`.
If [aspect ratio](#aspect_ratio) is specified, `width` and `height` are not used. And API will try to fit the video of the viewport size into the specified aspect ratio.
#### aspect ratio
If [aspect ratio](#aspect_ratio) is specified, `width` and `height` are not used. And API will try to fit the video of the viewport size into the specified aspect ratio.
#### scenario
Available scenarios formats:
-   not specified or `default` is for [the default animation scenario](#default-stand-still).
-   `scroll` is for [the scrolling screenshots](#scrollable-scrolling-screenshot).
The default value is `default`.
#### clip
You can clip part of the video. But currently, it is only available when the format is `gif`.
Use `clip_width`, `clip_height, `clip_x`and`clip_y` to specify the clip size and coordinates.
### Regular
Animated screenshots also support most options supported by regular image screenshots. There is a list of supported options:
-   `omit_background` but only for the `mov` format;
-   [credentials](/docs/options/#credentials);
-   [essentials](/docs/options/#essentials), except `selector` and with different values for [format](#format);
-   [viewport](/docs/options/#viewport);
-   [emulations](/docs/options/#emulations);
-   [customization](/docs/options/#customization);
-   [blocking](/docs/options/#blocking);
-   [geolocation](/docs/options/#geolocation);
-   [request](/docs/options/#request);
-   [wait](/docs/options/#wait);
-   [caching](/docs/options/#caching);
-   [storing](/docs/options/#storing).
# Async and Webhooks
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
ScreenshotOne supports asynchronous screenshot rendering and webhooks. The document describes both of them in one
place since usually they are used together.
The main current supported use case is to render screenshots asynchronously, [upload them to S3](/docs/upload-to-s3/) and return the file location to the specified webhook. That's what customers asked to implement first.
## Async
You can literally execute any request asynchronously by setting the `async` option to `true.` But not every request makes sense to execute asynchronously.
Once you set `async=true,` the API checks your access key and limits and returns the response immediately but continues to execute the request.
One of the top use cases for which it was requested is uploading files to S3 asynchronously without waiting for screenshots to be rendered.
An example of such a request could be:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=0MpjJxw8Vk7ZAw&url=https://example.com&store=true&storage_path=example.com&response_type=json&async=true
```
You request rendering but don't wait for the response. What if you want to get the result of uploading? You can do it by using webhooks.
## Webhooks
Using webhooks with ScreenshotOne allows you to deliver the results of the request execution to your URL as a POST body.
<Alert>
Currently, caching is not supported for webhooks since it doesn't make much
sense. If you need its support for other use cases, please, send a chat
message or email to `support@screenshotone.com`.
</Alert>
You can use webhooks with both synchronous and asynchronous requests. But usually, it is used in combination with asynchronous requests.
An example of an asynchronous request that uploads rendered screenshot to S3 and sends a webhook might look like this:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=0MpjJxw8Vk7ZAw&url=https://example.com&store=true&storage_path=example.com&response_type=json&async=true&webhook_url=https://example.com&storage_return_location=true
```
Not that, to get the location, you must specify the `storage_return_location` parameter as `true`.
An example of the webhook request body you will receive:
```
{
// ...
"store": {
// ...
"location": "..."
}
}
```
You also receive the `X-ScreenshotOne-Signature` (`x-screenshotone-signature`) header that you should use to validate the webhook request body and make sure that ScreenshotOne sent the request.
### Verifying Signature
To ensure that ScreenshotOne sent the request, you should get the signature from the `X-ScreenshotOne-Signature` header and verify it with your secret key from [the access page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access) by applying the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm.
<Alert>
Never share your secret key with any party. In case it is leaked, you can
quickly regenerate it on [the access
page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access).
</Alert>
A pseudo-code on TypeScript (Node.js) of how you can do it:
```javascript
import * as crypto from "crypto";
const receivedSignature = request.headers.get("x-screenshotone-signature");
const requestBody = await request.rawText();
const calculatedSignature = crypto
.createHmac("sha256", yourSecretKey)
.update(requestBody, "utf-8")
.digest("hex");
if (calculatedSignature !== receivedSignature) {
// the signature is not valid
// you should not process this request and reject it immediately
throw new Error("...");
}
// it is safe to process the request
// you can do something with the webhook request body
```
### Disable Signing
Singing webhook request body takes time. If you are sure that your webhooks are unique and secret, you might want to disable signing to improve performance by using `webhook_sign=false`.
### Debugging and support headers
There are a few headers that are not part of the body and are not participating in the signing. They must not be used for any logic; it is just for debugging and support purposes:
-   `x-screenshotone-rendering-seconds`—screenshot rendering time in seconds with fractions, e.g. `2.56`;
-   `x-screenshotone-size-bytes`—screenshot size if available (not streaming), e.g. `30033`;
-   `x-screenshotone-trace-id`—unique request trace id when reaching out to the ScreenshotOne support;
-   `x-screenshotone-reference`—screenshot or video id (if available) that can be seen in the history or used when reaching out to the ScreenshotOne support.
## Summary
That's it. In case you have any questions or problems, feel free to write to `support@screenshotone.com`.
# Bulk Screenshots
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
## Request
You can use a bulk screenshot-taking feature to take many screenshots in one request.
Send a simple POST HTTP request to `/bulk` path with the list of URLs (HTML or Markdown):
```
POST https://api.screenshotone.com/bulk
{
"access_key": "<your access key>"
"execute": false,
"optimize": false,
"options": {"url": "https://example.com", "viewport_width": 1280, "viewport_height": 1024, "block_ads": true},
"requests": [
{"viewport_width": 360, "viewport_height": 640}, // a screenshot of example.com with a different viewport
{"url": "https://example.com"},
{"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "block_cookie_banners": true},
{"html": "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>", "block_ads": false},
{"markdown": "**Yes!**"}
]
}
```
The options property contains default options that will be applied to every request. And for every request, you can specify options to override the default values. You can specify all [the regular options you use to take a single screenshot](/docs/options).
You can specify the access key as a query parameter `access_key=<your access key>`, an HTTP header `X-Access-Key: <your access key>`, or in the request's body.
## Response
The response contains an array of screenshot URLs you can use to download the screenshots:
```json
{
"responses": [
{"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=http://example.com&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=true"},
{"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://finance.yahoo.com&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=true&block_cookie_banners=true"},
{"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?html=<h1>Hello, world!</h1>&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=false&block_cookie_banners=true"}
]
}
```
But if you requested to [execute requests](#execute-requests), the result will also contain a summary execution response for each request:
```
[
{
"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=http://example.com&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=true",
"response": {
"is_successful": true,
"status": 200,
"statusText": "OK"
}
},
{
"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://finance.yahoo.com&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=true&block_cookie_banners=true",
"response": {
"is_successful": true,
"status": 200,
"statusText": "OK"
}
},
{
"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?html=<h1>Hello, world!</h1>&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=false&block_cookie_banners=true",
"response": {
"is_successful": true,
"status": 200,
"statusText": "OK"
}
},
{
"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?markdown=**Yes!**&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=false&block_cookie_banners=true",
"response": {
"is_successful": true,
"status": 200,
"statusText": "OK"
}
}
]
```
As you noticed, images are not returned, but in case of an error, the `is_successful` property will be `false`, and you can expect the `body` property to explore the error:
```
[
{
"url": "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=http://example.com&viewport_width=1280&viewport_height=1024&block_ads=true",
"response": {
"is_successful": false,
"status": 400,
"statusText": "Bad request",
body: {
"error_code": "concurrency_limit_reached"
"error_message": "Concurrency limit is reached"
}
}
}
]
```
## Execute requests
Bulk screenshots are implemented in a lazy loading way. It means that the screenshot is literally taken when you tried to download it, not when you sent a bulk request. If you want to execute each request before you get a response, set the parameter `execute` to `true`:
```
POST https://api.screenshotone.com/bulk
{
"access_key": "<your access key>"
"execute": true,
// ...
}
```
But make sure to wait enough time until all the screenshots are done.
## Optimizations
To take bulk screenshots faster, you can use the optimization feature if you want to take bulk screenshots for the same URLs (HTML or Markdown) but with a different set of parameters:
```
POST https://api.screenshotone.com/bulk
{
"access_key": "<your access key>"
"execute": true,
"optimize": true,
"options": {"url": "https://example.com", "viewport_width": 1280, "viewport_height": 1024},
"requests": [
{"viewport_width": 360, "viewport_height": 640}, // a screenshot of example.com with a different viewport
{"viewport_width": 736, "viewport_height": 414}
]
}
```
<Alert>
The feature only works when `execute` is set to `true`.
</Alert>
The optimization is not guaranteed since many sites can reload and take the same time to render in case the viewport is changed. And some options, like blocking and not blocking ads, do require a page reload, which takes the same time as not using optimization at all.
The best approach is to test if it works for your use case.
## Use cases
### Upload bulk screenshots to S3-compatible storage
In the example, I want to take screenshots for one site but for different devices and upload them to [S3-compatible storage](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storing):
```
POST https://api.screenshotone.com/bulk
{
"access_key": "<your access key>"
"execute": true,
"options": {"url": "https://example.com", "store": true, "response_type": "empty"},
"requests": [
{"viewport_device": "pixel_4a_5g_landscape", "storage_path": "pixel_4a_5g_landscape"},
{"viewport_device": "iphone_13_pro", "storage_path": "iphone_13_pro"},
{"viewport_device": "iphone_13", "storage_path": "iphone_13"}
]
}
```
In this example, I upload screenshots taken from different devices and save the files with the names of the devices.
## Limitations
Currently, only up to 20 requests are supported in the one bulk request.
# Errors
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
<Alert>
There is [a detailed guide](/docs/guides/how-to-handle-api-errors/) on how
to handle the ScreenshotOne API errors.
</Alert>
The request might return an error due to an internal error, invalid options or when the limit is reached. Our screenshot API follows the HTTP status code semantic and returns JSON in case of an error:
```
GET https://api.screenshotone.com/?[options]
Content-Type: application/json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "an_error_code",
"error_message": "An error message",
"documentation_url": "..."
}
```
The API will always return a human-readable error message, error code as a string key, and suitable HTTP status code.
## Codes with explanations

# ScreenshotOne IP Ranges
In case you need to allow access from the ScreenshotOne API to your servers, you can configure your firewall to allow the following IP addresses:
1. IPs for the `east-4` region [from public Google Cloud IP ranges](https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json).
2. Hetzner GPU rendering IP (if applicable for your use case)—`95.216.67.59`.
3. IP range for New York from [DigitalOcean Public IPs](https://digitalocean.com/geo/google.csv).
If that doesn't work for you, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com` with any questions you have and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
# Signed Links
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
When you share links to the screenshots with your access key in public, there is a problem that everybody can take your API access key and reuse it to take screenshots on their own and exhaust your screenshot quota.
To prevent others from using your API key, you need to:
1. [Sign every request](https://screenshotone.com/docs/signed-requests/#signing-requests) you are going to share publicly.
2. [Require signing](https://screenshotone.com/docs/signed-requests/#require-signing) for every request.
Then even if the potential unscrupulous person sees or steals your access key, they can't reuse it until they also steal your secret key (signing key).
You generally don't need to sign requests if you will not share screenshot links publicly and will use screenshot API only on the server-side.
## Signing requests
<Alert>
Singed links do not work with HTTP "POST" requests. The feature is intended to be used for sharing links in public.
</Alert>
To sign the request, like `https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=0Ij4LFMtFnGUrA&url=https://apple.com`, you need to follow the simple algorithm:
1. Use your secret to hash the query string `access_key=0Ij4LFMtFnGUrA&url=https://apple.com` with the HMAC SHA256 algorithm.
2. **Append** the signature parameter with the hash: `https://api.screenshotone.com/?access_key=0Ij4LFMtFnGUrA&url=https://apple.com&signature=70bea3e52efc43834129ecbea236f38bf9bb4a7cd7c2e1951017435defd4dbaf`.
To hash the query string with your secret key and HMAC SHA256 algorithm in the CLI, you can run the following command:
```bash
$ echo -n "access_key=0Ij4LFMtFnGUrA&url=https://apple.com" | openssl sha256 -hmac "m9ajW9br9hTw2A"                     130 ↵
70bea3e52efc43834129ecbea236f38bf9bb4a7cd7c2e1951017435defd4dbaf
```
You can need to apply the same algorithm in the language of your choice.
## Require signing
After you start signing requests and make sure that the API accepts your requests, you can require signing every request.
Go to [the access configuration page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access) and enforce signing every request.
The change will be applied immediately, but cached screenshots might not be impacted.
That's it. After this step, unsigned requests with your API access key are not accepted.
## Animated screenshots
[Animated screenshots](/docs/animated-screenshots/) also support signed links. There is no difference in the underlying mechanism besides that the URL prefix should be `/animate`.
# Devices
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
import devices from "screenshotone-devices";
Instead of manually specifying viewport parameters like width and height, you can specify a device to use for emulation. In addition, other parameters of the viewport, including the user agent, will be set automatically.
The [viewport_device](/docs/options/#viewport_device) option sets the next options for you: [viewport_width](/docs/options/#viewport_width), [viewport_height](/docs/options/#viewport_height), [device_scale_factor](/docs/options/#device_scale_factor), [viewport_mobile](/docs/options/#viewport_mobile), [viewport_has_touch](/docs/options/#viewport_has_touch), [viewport_landscape](/docs/options/#viewport_landscape). You can change these options and override the ones set by the `viewport_device` option.
<Alert>
API does not use an actual device to take a screenshot. It is emulation that works in most cases.
</Alert>
Use the `id` property of the device as the [viewport_device](/docs/options/#viewport_device) option, e.g. `viewport_device=galaxy_s9+_landscape`.
You can get the list of supported devices by:
```

# Charging Extra
You can set the hard limit for screenshots higher than the limit in your current plan. And by doing this, you are enabling charging for extra screenshots. The option is available only for paying customers who are organization owners.
![Changing the hard limit](charge_extra.png)
Once the charging extra is enabled (at [your subscription page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/subscription)), you will be charged for successful not cached requests that go over your plan limitation.
## Examples
Let's look at different examples of an artificial subscription plan. Imagine you have a limit of 10000 screenshots monthly, and the price of one extra screenshot is $0.004:
1. The plan limit is 10000, the hard limit is 15000, and you rendered 12000 screenshots. You will be charged for 2000 extra screenshots. $0.004 x 2000 = $8.
2. The plan limit is 10000, the hard limit is 15000, and you rendered 12500 screenshots. You will be charged for 3000 extra screenshots. $0.004 x 3000 = $12.
Why for 3000 extra screenshots?
**It is because extra charges are rounded to the close upper bound of a thousand screenshots.**
If you render only one extra screenshot, you pay for 1000 screenshots. If you render 1001, you pay for 2000, and so on. If you render 999, you pay for 1000, and so on.
## Upgrading subscription
Once you upgrade your subscription, your hard limit is reset. And you need to set it up again.
## Cancelling or downgrading subscription
Before you cancel your subscription, ScreenshotOne will try to charge you for extra screenshots and only then cancel it.
For downgrading, charging happens only when downgrading to a free plan. Otherwise, there is no need.
## When you are charged
ScreenshotOne charges you periodically over the extra usage if needed, usually once per 1000 screenshots.
Or you also might be charged in one "batch" for the extra usage. It depends on the internal logic of the service.
## Maximum hard limit
Every new customer has a maximum hard limit of 100,000 screenshots. If you need to upgrade it and make it higher, feel free to write to `support@screenshotone.com`. Please, describe your use case.
ScreenshotOne is a scalable and highly performant API  that has paying customers who make render more than 100,000 screenshots monthly. Still, there is a need to make sure that there is no service abuse and that high-quality service can be delivered. That's why the maximum hard limit for new customers is applied.

# Get Usage
You can get your current plan usage by:
```
GET https://api.screenshotone.com/usage?access_key=<YOUR ACCESS KEY>`
{
"total": 10000,
"available: 950,
"used": 9050,
"concurrency": {
"limit":20,
"remaining":20,
"reset":1681646947775437264
}
}
```
A bit of clarification:
- `total` is the total number of requests allowed in the current billing plan period;
- `available` is the number of available requests until the end of the current period;
- `used` is the number of successfully executed requests.
- `concurrency.limit` is the total number of concurrent requests allowed per interval;
- `concurrency.remaining` is the number of available concurrent requests allowed per interval;
- `concurrency.reset` is the time when the limitation will be reset, in UNIX timestamp format in nanoseconds.
# Access Key Invalid
It is an API error returned when the provided access key is invalid or incorrect.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "access_key_invalid",
"error_message": "The `access_key` parameter is set, but it is not correct. Please, check out the access dashboard page to get the access key—https://dash.screenshotone.com/access.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/access-key-invalid/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Incorrect Access Key
One common reason for the "access_key_invalid" error is using an incorrect access key. This can happen if the key is copied incorrectly or if an old key is being used.
To fix this, ensure you are using the correct access key by visiting the [access dashboard page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access) and copying the key directly from there.
### Typographical Errors
Typos in the access key parameter can also lead to this error. This includes extra spaces, missing characters, or incorrect case sensitivity.
To fix this, carefully check and re-enter the access key, ensuring there are no typographical errors. Copy-pasting the key directly from the dashboard is recommended.
### Misconfigured Environment
In some cases, the environment where the API request is being made might be misconfigured, leading to the wrong access key being used.
To fix this, review your environment configuration settings to ensure the correct access key is being used in the appropriate environment (e.g., development, staging, production).
## Reach out to support
If you continue to face issues, please reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will assist you as soon as possible.
# Access Key Required
It is an API error returned when the access key parameter is missing in the request.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "access_key_required",
"error_message": "The `access_key` parameter is required. Please, check out the access dashboard page to get the access key—https://dash.screenshotone.com/access.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/access-key-required/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Missing Access Key Parameter
The most common reason for the "access_key_required" error is that the `access_key` parameter is not included in the request. This is mandatory for authenticating and authorizing the API request.
To fix this, ensure that you include the `access_key` parameter in your API request. You can obtain your access key from the [access dashboard page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access).
### Misconfigured Request
Sometimes, a request might be misconfigured, leading to the `access_key` parameter being omitted.
To fix this, review the configuration of your API client or the code that constructs the request to ensure that the `access_key` parameter is always included.
### Typographical Errors
A typo or incorrect parameter name might lead to the `access_key` not being recognized by the API.
To fix this, double-check the parameter name in your request to ensure it is spelled correctly as `access_key`.
### Programmatic Issues
If you are dynamically generating requests (e.g., through a script or application), there might be a bug causing the `access_key` to be omitted.
To fix this, debug your script or application to ensure the `access_key` is being properly set and included in every API request.

# Content Contains Specified String
It is an API error returned when the page content contains a specified string that triggers a failure condition.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "content_contains_specified_string",
"error_message": "The page content contains the specified string by the `fail_if_content_contains` option. If it seems to be a mistake or not what you expected, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` as quickly as possible, and we will assist and try to resolve your problem.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/content-contains-specified-string/"

```
The page content contains the specified string by the `fail_if_content_contains` option. If it seems to be a mistake or not what you expected, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` as quickly as possible, and we will assist and try to resolve your problem.
# Concurrency Limit Reached
It is an API error returned when the request concurrency limit has been reached.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "concurrency_limit_reached",
"error_message": "You reached the request concurrency limit, retry after a while. Or feel free to upgrade your current plan—https://dash.screenshotone.com/subscription.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/concurrency-limit-reached/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Exceeded Concurrency Limit
The most common reason for the "concurrency_limit_reached" error is that you have reached the maximum number of concurrent requests allowed by your current subscription plan.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Wait and retry**: Wait for some of the current requests to complete and then retry your request.
2. **Upgrade your plan**: Visit the [subscription page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/subscription) to upgrade your plan, which will increase your concurrency limit.
### High Traffic Periods
During high traffic periods, you might hit the concurrency limit more frequently if multiple requests are being made simultaneously.
To fix this, consider:
1. **Load balancing**: Implementing load balancing strategies to distribute requests more evenly over time.
2. **Queueing requests**: Queueing requests and processing them in batches to avoid hitting the concurrency limit.
### Inefficient Request Handling
If your application is not handling requests efficiently, it might lead to a buildup of concurrent requests, hitting the limit.
To fix this, review your application’s request handling logic to ensure that requests are being processed and completed as efficiently as possible.

The page content is missing the specified string by the `fail_if_content_missing` option. If it seems to be a mistake or not what you expected, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` as quickly as possible, and we will assist and try to resolve your problem.
# Internal Application Error
It is an API error returned when the API fails to serve the request due to internal reasons:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_message": "The API failed to serve your request. You can try replay the request. If the error is repeated after a few retries, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com.`",
"error_code": "internal_application_error",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/internal-application-error/"
}
```
## Retry
On rare occasions it can be caused by the website you try to screenshot. So, you can retry the request. It is free, ScreenshotOne doesn't charge you for retries and cached requests.
## Reach out to support
Most of the time, the error is triggered because of some issues in the API or even because of some bugs.
If nothing helps you, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` and we will try to help you as fast as possible.
# Host Returned Error
It is an API error returned when the host server does not respond with a successful status code within the range of 200-299.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "host_returned_error",
"error_message": "If the host doesn't respond successfully within the range of 200-299 status codes, the API won't take a screenshot. You can force the API to take a screenshot of the error page by specifying `ignore_host_errors`=true. You can get the returned status code from the site by reading the `returned_status_code` field.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/host-returned-error/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Host Returned Non-Success Status Code
The most common reason for the "host_returned_error" error is that the host server returned a status code outside the 200-299 range, indicating an unsuccessful response.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Check host server status**: Ensure the host server is operational and capable of returning a successful status code.
2. **Review site response**: Investigate the response from the host server to understand why it is not returning a successful status code.
### Forcing Screenshot of Error Pages
If you want the API to take a screenshot of the error page even when the host returns an error, you can use the `ignore_host_errors` option.
To fix this, set `ignore_host_errors` to `true` in your API request:
```json
{
"ignore_host_errors": true
}
```
## Retrieving the Returned Status Code
You can get the status code returned by the host server by reading the `returned_status_code` field in the response. This will help in diagnosing and understanding the nature of the error.

# JavaScript and TypeScript (Node.js) SDK and Code Examples
:::note
If you have any questions, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com`.
:::
### Installation
Run the next command to install the JavaScript and TypeScript Node.js SDK to take screenshots:
```shell
npm install screenshotone-api-sdk --save
```
### Usage
Don't forget to [sign up](https://dash.screenshotone.com/sign-up) to get access and secret keys.
:::danger
By default, the generated URL by SDK is not signed, and you can't share it,
because the API key will be leaked.
Use the method designated to generate a signed URL specifically—`generateSignedTakeURL()`.
Notice, in the recent versions of the SDK, all methods are asynchronous.
:::
Generate a screenshot URL without executing the request. Or download the screenshot. It is up to you:
```javascript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as screenshotone from "screenshotone-api-sdk";
// create API client
const client = new screenshotone.Client("<access key>", "<secret key>");
// set up options
const options = screenshotone.TakeOptions.url("https://example.com")
.delay(3)
.blockAds(true);
// generate URL
const url = client.generateTakeURL(options); // or generateSignedTakeURL(options) for signed URLs
console.log(url);
// expected output: https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&delay=3&block_ads=true&access_key=%3Caccess+key%3E
// or download the screenshot
const imageBlob = await client.take(options);
const buffer = Buffer.from(await imageBlob.arrayBuffer());
fs.writeFileSync("example.png", buffer);
// the screenshot is store in the example.png file
```
Check out [other SDKs and code examples](/docs/code-examples/).
# Getting Started
You can use the API to generate invoices in PDF format for any given URL or HTML. Or make hundreds of screenshots of your site with different options to check that the site looks as expected.
Whatever use case you have, I get you covered. If there is a feature missing, please, contact me, and I will try to help you as fast as possible.
## First Touch
ScreenshotOne API is straightforward to use. There is an example of an actual request to an API:
```
GET https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://apple.com&access_key=<access key>
```
The result is:
![A screenshot of the Apple site](apple_screenshot.png)
[Sign up](https://dash.screenshotone.com/sign-up) to get the access key and start taking screenshots.
## Requests
ScreenshotOne API supports both GET and POST HTTP requests.
All requests are sent over HTTPS. HTTPS is a non-negotiable requirement to protect your privacy.
To take a screenshot of the site with GET HTTP request, send a request to:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?[options]
```
Takes and returns a screenshot of the given site with specified [options](/docs/options).
If you send a POST HTTP request to take a screenshot, you should specify options as JSON in the body of the request:
```
POST https://api.screenshotone.com/take
Content-Type: application/json
{
...[options]
}
```
### Access key
You can specify the access key as part of `GET` parameters, `POST` `JSON` body, or as a header `X-Access-Key`.
## Responses
The response format depends on the given options. You might request API to return an image of PNG type or raw HTML instead of rendering it.
API returns the `Content-Type` header set according to the relevant MIME type for the requested format in options.
Since API returns binary in the data, you can safely put the request URL to ScreenshotOne API directly into the <img> and <meta> tags:
```
<img
src="https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=apple.com&access_key=<your access key>"
alt="A screenshot of apple.com"
/>
```
## Errors
The request might return an error due to an internal error, invalid options or when the limit is reached. ScreenshotOne API follows the HTTP status code semantic and returns JSON in case of an error:
```
GET https://api.screenshotone.com/?[options]
Content-Type: application/json
{
"error": {
"code": "an_error_code",

```
The API will always return [a human-readable error message, error code, and suitable HTTP status code](/docs/errors).
# Invalid Storage Configuration
It is an API error returned when the storage configuration for S3 is invalid.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "invalid_storage_configuration",
"error_message": "If you haven't created the bucket in the `us-east-1` AWS region, please, specify your bucket region through an endpoint in a format like https://s3.<your-region>.amazonaws.com.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/invalid-storage-configuration/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Incorrect AWS S3 Bucket Region
One common reason for the "invalid_storage_configuration" error is that the S3 bucket is not created in the `us-east-1` region and the bucket region is not specified correctly.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Specify the bucket Region**: Ensure you specify your bucket region in the endpoint format like `https://s3.<your-region>.amazonaws.com`. Replace `<your-region>` with the actual AWS region where your bucket is located.
### Missing or misconfigured Bucket
If the S3 bucket does not exist or is misconfigured, this can lead to the "invalid_storage_configuration" error.
To fix this, consider:
1. **Verify bucket existence**: Check that the S3 bucket exists in your AWS account and is accessible.
2. **Correct bucket configuration**: Ensure the bucket is configured correctly, including permissions and policies.
### Incorrect Endpoint URL
The endpoint URL might be incorrectly formatted, causing the API to fail in accessing the specified S3 bucket.
To fix this, ensure the endpoint URL is correctly formatted as `https://s3.<your-region>.amazonaws.com`, with the correct region specified.
### AWS IAM Permissions
Inadequate permissions set in the AWS IAM policies might prevent the API from accessing the S3 bucket, leading to this error.
To fix this, ensure that the IAM roles and policies associated with your bucket have the necessary permissions to allow access from the API.

# Name Not Resolved
It is an API error returned when the domain name of the requested URL cannot be resolved.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "name_not_resolved",
"error_message": "Usually, the error happens when the domain name of the requested URL is not resolved. If you are trying to take a screenshot of a new site, please, wait a bit until the DNS records are refreshed.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/name-not-resolved/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Unresolved Domain Name
The most common reason for the "name_not_resolved" error is that the domain name of the requested URL cannot be resolved to an IP address. This often occurs with new domains or recently updated DNS records.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Wait for the DNS propagation if it is your website**: If you are trying to take a screenshot of a new site, wait for the DNS records to propagate fully. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours.
2. **Or check DNS configuration**: Ensure that the DNS configuration for the domain is correct and that the records are properly set up.
### Temporary DNS Issues
Temporary DNS issues can also cause the "name_not_resolved" error. These can be due to network problems, DNS server issues, or other transient conditions.
To fix this, consider simply retrying the request after a short wait
### Incorrect Domain Name
If the domain name is incorrectly typed or does not exist, the API will not be able to resolve it.
To fix this, verify that the domain name in the request is correct and exists.

# Request Aborted
It is an API error returned when the request was aborted either by the user or the intermediate proxies and can't be fulfilled.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "request_aborted",
"error_message": "The request was aborted either by the user or the intermediate proxies and can't be fulfilled. If the error persists, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/request-aborted/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### HTTP Client Timeouts
One common reason for the "request_aborted" error is HTTP client timeouts. This occurs when the client (e.g., a web browser or a server making a request) has a timeout setting that is shorter than the time it takes for the request to be processed.
To fix this, you can increase the timeout setting in your HTTP client configuration.
### Local Development Live Reloading
During local development, live reloading tools (such as those used in web development environments) may cause requests to be aborted if the server restarts or if the code is recompiled. This can lead to the "request_aborted" error.
To avoid this, ensure that you have a stable development environment and minimize the frequency of live reloads while making API requests.
### Edge Function Timeouts
If you are using edge functions or serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Edge Functions), they might have their own timeout settings. When these timeouts are exceeded, the request will be aborted, resulting in the "request_aborted" error.
To fix this, you should increase the timeout settings for your edge functions.

# Request Invalid
It is an API error returned when the request parameters are not valid.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "request_not_valid",
"error_message": "The request parameters are not valid. You can look at the `error_details` response field to get more details.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/request-invalid/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Invalid Request Parameters
The most common reason for the "request_not_valid" error is that one or more of the request parameters are invalid or missing.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Check `error_details` property**: Review the `error_details` field in the response to get specific information about which parameters are invalid.
2. **Correct request parameters**: Ensure that all required parameters are included in the request and that they are correctly formatted and valid.
### Missing Required Parameters
If required parameters are missing from the request, this will trigger the "request_not_valid" error.
To fix this, ensure that all mandatory parameters are provided in the request. Refer to the API documentation for a list of required parameters.
### Incorrect Data Types
Providing parameters with incorrect data types (e.g., a string instead of an integer) can lead to this error.
To fix this, verify that the data types of all parameters match the expected types as specified in the API documentation.
### Parameter Value Constraints
Some parameters may have constraints on their values (e.g., minimum or maximum length, specific formats). Violating these constraints will result in this error.
To fix this, check the constraints for each parameter in the API documentation and ensure that the provided values comply with these constraints.
### Syntax Errors
Syntax errors in the request, such as missing commas or brackets in JSON, can make the request invalid.
To fix this, carefully review the syntax of your request and correct any errors. Using a JSON validator can help identify syntax issues.

# Resulting Image Too Large
It is an API error returned when the resulting image is too large for the specified format.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_message": "The resulting image is too large for the specified format.",
"error_code": "resulting_image_too_large",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/resulting-image-too-large/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Using WebP format for full-page screenshots
The WebP format has size limits, and if you are taking a full-page screenshot, the resulting image might be too large for the WebP format.
There is 2 ways to address the issue:
1. Either use a different format, for example, PNG or JPEG.
2. Or set the `full_page_max_height` option to make sure the height of the resulting image always fits the specified format.
## Reach out to support
If you continue to face issues, please reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will assist you as soon as possible.
# Internal Application Error
It is an API error returned when the API fails to serve the request due to internal reasons:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_message": "The API failed to serve your request. You can try replay the request. If the error is repeated after a few retries, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com.`",
"error_code": "internal_application_error",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/internal-application-error/"
}
```
## Retry
On rare occasions it can be caused by the website you try to screenshot. So, you can retry the request. It is free, ScreenshotOne doesn't charge you for retries and cached requests.
## Reach out to support
Most of the time, the error is triggered because of some issues in the API or even because of some bugs.
If nothing helps you, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` and we will try to help you as fast as possible.
# Invalid Cookie Parameter
It is an API error returned when the `cookies` parameter is invalid.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_message": "The `cookies` parameters you provided are invalid. Please, consider providing different values and adhere to the format specified in the ScreenshotOne documentation.",
"error_code": "invalid_cookie_parameter",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/invalid-cookie-parameter/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### The format of the parameter is invalid
Make sure you adhere to the format specified in the [ScreenshotOne options documentation](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#cookies):
```
cookies=name1=val1; Domain=example.com; Secure; HttpOnly
```
It is not for demonstration purposes, but the string must be URL-encoded.
If you need to specify multiple cookies, you can do it like this:
```
cookies=name1=val1; Domain=example.com; Secure; HttpOnly&cookies=name2=val2; Domain=example.com; Secure; HttpOnly
```

# Matched Failed Request
This API error is returned when a request matched by the specified pattern in the `fail_if_request_failed` option has been failed:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "matched_failed_request",
"error_message": "A request matched by the specified pattern by the `fail_if_request_failed` option has been failed. If it seems to be a mistake or not what you expected, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` as quickly as possible, and we will assist and try to resolve your problem.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/matched-failed-request/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
The reason you get this error message is because you specified the [fail_if_request_failed](/docs/options/#fail_if_request_failed) option.
If you want to disable this behavior, you simply need to remove the parameter from your request. If you have a request like:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com&fail_if_request_failed=**example.com**
```
Make it like this:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com
```
In case, if the error persists, please immediately reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will try to fix that as soon as possible.

# Script Trigger Redirect
It is an API error returned when the API detects that the script will trigger a redirect and screenshots won't be rendered successfully.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "script_triggers_redirect",
"error_message": "The specified \"scripts\" option might trigger a redirect, please, specify the \"scripts_wait_until\" option. If you think it is a mistake, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com`.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/script-triggers-redirect/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
Let's quickly consider possible reasons and possible solutions.
### Add some wait options
Since the custom script you add with the "scripts" options triggers a redirect, you must also set [the "scripts_wait_until" option](/docs/options/#scripts_wait_until), too.
And to force the API to wait until the new page is loaded.
## Reach out to support
If nothing helps you, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` and we will try to help you as fast as possible.
# Selector Not Found
It is an API error returned when the specified selector is not found or not visible within the given timeout period.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "selector_not_found",
"error_message": "If `selector` is specified and `error_on_selector_not_found`=true, or `click` is specified and `error_on_click_selector_not_found`=true, the error will be returned if the element by selector is not visible or it took more than timeout seconds to render it, but not more than 30 seconds.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/selector-not-found/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Selector Not Visible
The most common reason for the "selector_not_found" error is that the element specified by the selector is not visible on the page within the given timeout period.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Check the selector**: Ensure that the selector you are using is correct and matches an element on the page.
2. **Increase timeout**: If the element takes longer to load, increase the timeout value to give the element more time to become visible.
### Element is visible but has zero height
If there is an empty element on the page, the API will not be able to take a screenshot of it. In that case you will still get the "selector_not_found" error.
One of the ways to still get a screenshot is to make sure that [`error_on_selector_not_found`](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#error_on_selector_not_found) is set to `false` (and it is `false` by default).
You will get then the screenshot of the page instead of the error.
### Incorrect Selector
An incorrect or invalid selector can lead to this error, as the API cannot find the element on the page.
To fix this, verify that the selector is correctly specified and matches the element you want to target.
### Element Not Rendered
If the element is not rendered within the timeout period (not more than 30 seconds), the error will be triggered.
To fix this, ensure that the element is being rendered properly and within the expected time frame. You might need to investigate any delays in rendering the element.
### Conditional Visibility
If the element's visibility is conditional (e.g., depends on user interaction or specific page states), it might not be visible when the API checks for it.
To fix this, ensure that the conditions for the element's visibility are met before making the API request.
### Page Load Issues
Page load issues or JavaScript errors on the page can prevent the element from becoming visible.
To fix this, check for any page load issues or JavaScript errors that might be interfering with the rendering of the element.

# Screenshot Options
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
import Details from "@/components/docs/Details.astro";
This document lists all available request options to take screenshots of websites, render HTML, or Markdown.
## Credentials
### access_key
Each request must have an access key to authenticate the API user. You can find it on the [access page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access).
An example of the request URL with `access_key`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://apple.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the Apple site taken by screenshot
API](./default_example.png)
</Details>
### signature
A signature is optional. It is used for [the signed requests](/docs/signed-requests).
<Alert>
Do not use the secret (signing) key as a signature. A signature is a complex
parameter that is [a hash of all screenshot parameters with a signing
key](/docs/signed-requests).
</Alert>
You can force signing all requests [access page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access).
## Essentials
### url
URL of the site to take a screenshot of. One of the [Markdown](#markdown), [HTML](#html) or [URL](#url) parameters is required.
An example of the request URL with `url=https://www.youtube.com/feed/explore`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://www.youtube.com/feed/explore&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the Youtube site taken by screenshot
API](./youtube_example.png)
</Details>
### html
HTML you want to render. One of the [Markdown](#markdown), [HTML](#html) or [URL](#url) parameters is required.
An example of the request URL with `html=<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?html=<h1>Hello,%20world!</h1>&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the custom HTML taken by screenshot
API](./html_example.png)
</Details>
### markdown
Markdown you want to render. One of the [Markdown](#markdown), [HTML](#html) or [URL](#url) parameters is required.
An example of the request URL with `markdown=# Hello, world!` (encoded to `markdown=%23%20Hello%2C%20world!`):
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?html=%23%20Hello%2C%20world!&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the custom Markdown taken by screenshot
API](./markdown.jpeg)
</Details>
### format
<Alert>
You can get the HTML content of the page and image in one request by using
the [metadata_content](#metadata_content) parameter.
</Alert>
Available response formats:
-   `png`
-   `jpeg` or `jpg`
-   `webp`
-   `gif`
-   `jp2`
-   `tiff`
-   `avif`
-   `heif`
-   `pdf` (see [PDF options](#pdf-rendering))
-   `html` (text representation)
-   `markdown` (text representation)
Default value is `jpg`.
An example of the request URL with `format=jpeg` (an alias for `format=jpg`):
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?format=jpeg&url=https://apple.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the Apple site taken by screenshot
API](./format_jpeg_example.jpeg)
</Details>
For the HTML format (`format=html`), consider including the shadow DOM elements with the [`include_shadow_dom`](#include_shadow_dom) option.
### response_type
Available response types:
-   `by_format` — return exactly the response defined in the [format option](#format). If `format=png`, the response will be the binary representation of the `png` with the content type header `image/png`;
-   `empty` — return only status or error. It is suitable when you want to [upload the screenshot to storage](#storing) and don't care about the results. It also speeds up the response since there are no networking costs involved.
-   `json` — A method returns the response in the JSON format, but it is only suitable if you use options that are effective for JSON. By default, the JSON response will be empty. But for example, when you use [caching](#caching), the JSON will be populated with additional data.
The default value is `by_format`.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?response_type=empty&url=https://example.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### selector
A CSS-like selector of the element to take a screenshot of. It is optional.
If the selector is specified and `error_on_selector_not_found=true`, the error will be returned if the element by selector is not visible or it took more than `timeout` seconds to render it, but not more than 30 seconds.
For HTML or Markdown formats, the selector returns the outer rendered HTML of the provided input.
Supports `shadow/` selectors which will traverse the shadow DOM elements. It will be slower, and if many elements have the same selectors, the first one will be chosen.
An example of the request URL with `selector=.content`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?selector=.content&url=https://scalabledeveloper.com/posts/context-in-go/&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the content part of the Scalable Developer site taken by
screenshot API](./scalable_developer_content_example.png)
</Details>
<br />
The same page without selector:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://scalabledeveloper.com/posts/context-in-go/&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A screenshot of the Scalable Developer site taken by screenshot
API](./scalable_developer_example_without_selector.png)
</Details>
Setting the [selector](#selector) option changes the behavior of the [capture_beyond_viewport](#capture_beyond_viewport) option, and sets it to `true` by default.
### selector_scroll_into_view
When you take a screenshot of an element by [selector](#selector), there is a rare case where the page or the part of the element might not be visible on the viewport or
the element might contain lazy loaded images or elements that are not visible on the viewport.
With the `selector_scroll_into_view` option, you control if you want to scroll the page to the element or not and to trigger lazy loaded images and elements.
The option is set to `true` by default.
### capture_beyond_viewport
When you take [a full page screenshot](#full_page) or a screenshot of an element by [selector](#selector), there is a rare case where the page or the part of the element might not be visible on the viewport.
With the `capture_beyond_viewport` option, you control if you want to take the screenshot of the full page or the element (`capture_beyond_viewport=true`) or if you are OK with taking a screenshot of the part of the page or the element (`capture_beyond_viewport=false`).
When you take [full page screenshot](#full_page) or you take screenshot of an element by [selector](#selector).
The option is set to `true` by default for the full-page screenshots, when [full_page](#full_page) is `true`.
You might find it useful to check out [the examples of how the captureBeyondViewport option works](/blog/capture-beyond-viewport-in-puppeteer-and-chrome-devtools-protocol) "examples of how the captureBeyondViewport option works").
The option is `true` by default for the screenshots by the [selector](#selector), too.
### scroll_into_view
It scrolls the page if needed and ensures that the given selector is present in the view when taking a screenshot.
If more than one element matches the selector, the first visible element in DOM is selected.
The element will be positioned at the top of the viewport. To adjust the position a bit before taking a screenshot,
use the [scroll_into_view_adjust_top](#scroll_into_view_adjust_top) option.
In case, if the selector is not found, it will render the viewport at the top of the page. To change this behavior, use the [error_on_selector_not_found](#error_on_selector_not_found) option, set it to `true` to return an error if the selector is not found.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?scroll_into_view=%23faq&url=https://screenshotone.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### scroll_into_view_adjust_top
After the given element appears in the viewport and its top coordinate is aligned with the viewport's top, you can adjust the position a bit before taking a screenshot by specifying the `scroll_into_view_adjust_top` parameter.
By default, it is `0`. But you can use negative and positive integers.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?scroll_into_view_adjust_top=-100&scroll_into_view=%23faq&url=https://screenshotone.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### request_gpu_rendering
By default is disabled and currently available only for the top-tier paid plans.
Setting `request_gpu_rendering` to `true` hints API to route requests to servers with supported hardware rendering acceleration.
It is not 100% guaranteed to satisfied and software acceleration might be used as a fallaback, but most of the time the ScreenshotOne API will do its best to render screenshots with GPU support if the option is set to `true`.
However, you can use the `fail_if_gpu_rendering_fails` option to force the request to fail if GPU rendering fails.
### include_shadow_dom
By default is disabled and equals to `false`.
Setting `include_shadow_dom` to `true` will use a different method of content extraction for requests that has `format=html`
or request `metadata_content=true`. The API will try to include all open and closed shadow DOM roots in the content. By default, they are not included.
### attachment_name
The option allows you to specify the name of the attachment. The format will be added as a suffix to the name.
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?attachment_name=screenshot&url=https://example.com&access_key=<your access key>&format=jpg
```
It will trigger the browser to download the screenshot with the name `screenshot.jpg`
## PDF Rendering
If you want resulting PDF reflects a full page screenshot as close as possible, use the combination of next options:
```
format=pdf&media_type=screen&pdf_print_background=true&pdf_fit_one_page=true
```
### pdf_print_background
Set to `true` to print background graphics. The default value is `false`.
### pdf_fit_one_page
The default value is `false`.
When the option is set to `true``, the API will try to fit the website on one page. It is the closest equivalent to a full-page screenshot as a PDF without splitting into pages.
### pdf_landscape
Set to `true` to set PDF orientation to landscape. It is `false` by default.
### pdf_paper_format
Specifies the paper format for the PDF output. Available options are:
- "a0": ISO A0 paper size (841 x 1189 mm)
- "a1": ISO A1 paper size (594 x 841 mm)
- "a2": ISO A2 paper size (420 x 594 mm)
- "a3": ISO A3 paper size (297 x 420 mm)
- "a4": ISO A4 paper size (210 x 297 mm)
- "a5": ISO A5 paper size (148 x 210 mm)
- "a6": ISO A6 paper size (105 x 148 mm)
- "legal": Legal paper size (8.5 x 14 inches)
- **"letter": Letter paper size (8.5 x 11 inches)—default.**
- "tabloid": Tabloid paper size (11 x 17 inches)
If not specified, the default paper format is "a4".
## OpenAI Vision Integration

You will get the result either as a `X-ScreenshotOne-Vision-Completion` header in the reponse or as:
```json
{
"vision": {
"completion": "..."
}
}
```
If you use `response_type=json`.
### openai_api_key
Use your OpenAI API key to send requests to the OpenAI API key. It is not stored in the ScreenshotOne database.
### vision_prompt
Specify the prompt you want to use along with the screenshot of the site.
### vision_max_tokens
Specify how many tokens at max the GPT vision must return as a response.
## Clip
There is a guide on [how to screenshot an area of a site](/docs/guides/how-to-screenshot-an-area-of-a-site/) with examples of how to use clip options.
### clip_x
You can use clip options ([clip_x](#clip_x), [clip_y](#clip_y), [clip_width](#clip_width), [clip_height](#clip_height)) to clip only the part of the screen.
The `clip_x` option specifies only the top coordinate (x) of the area to clip.
### clip_y
You can use clip options ([clip_x](#clip_x), [clip_y](#clip_y), [clip_width](#clip_width), [clip_height](#clip_height)) to clip only the part of the screen.
The `clip_y` option specifies only the left coordinate (y) of the area to clip.
### clip_width
You can use clip options ([clip_x](#clip_x), [clip_y](#clip_y), [clip_width](#clip_width), [clip_height](#clip_height)) to clip only the part of the screen.
The `clip_width` option specifies only the width of the area to clip.
### clip_height
You can use clip options ([clip_x](#clip_x), [clip_y](#clip_y), [clip_width](#clip_width), [clip_height](#clip_height)) to clip only the part of the screen.
The `clip_height` option specifies only the width of the area to clip.
## Full page
Read more suggestions on [how to take better full-page screenshots](/docs/guides/full-page-screenshots/).
### full_page
To take the screenshot of the full page, set `full_page=true`.
Default value is `false`.
When `full_page` is set to `true`, [full_page_scroll](#full_page_scroll) is automatically set to `true`, until you override it. It is done to make sure that all lazy loaded images are requested and rendered.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?full_page=true&url=https://netflix.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
<Details>
![A full page screenshot of the Apple site taken by screenshot
API](./full_page_example.png)
</Details>
### full_page_scroll
If set to `true`, scrolls to the bottom of the page and back to the top. Default value is `false`.
When `full_page` is set to `true`, `full_page_scroll` is automatically set to `true`, until you override it. It is done to make sure that all lazy loaded images are requested and rendered.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?full_page_scroll=true&full_page=true&url=https://netflix.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### full_page_scroll_delay
The default value is `400` microseconds. Use it to specify how fast you want to scroll the page to the bottom.
Some sites require larger values than `400` microseconds to trigger the loading of lazy-load images.
Use it in combination with [full_page_scroll_delay](#full_page_scroll_by) to find optimal solution.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?full_page_scroll_delay=1000&full_page_scroll=true&full_page=true&url=https://netflix.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### full_page_scroll_by
The default value is the height of the viewport. Use it to specify how fast you want to scroll the page to the bottom.
Some sites require values less than viewport height to trigger the loading of lazy-load images. Try to play with values between `100` and `500`. However, don't hesitate to try out any value that might work for you.
Use it in combination with [full_page_scroll_delay](#full_page_scroll_delay) to find optimal solution.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?full_page_scroll_by=400&full_page_scroll=true&full_page=true&url=https://netflix.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### full_page_max_height
The default value is not set. Use it to limit the height of the full page screenshot. Also allows to handle
and fix problems related to infinite scrolling.
An example of the request URL:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?full_page_max_height=10000&full_page_scroll=true&full_page=true&url=https://netflix.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
### full_page_algorithm
The default value is `default`.
The `default` algorithm is the same as the one used in the Chrome DevTools Protocol, with some tuning and for some websites with different optimizations.
But if you set `full_page_algorithm=by_sections`, the API will take a screenshot section by section and then combine them into one image.
It allows more complex pages with animations to be rendered correctly.
The `by_sections` will scroll the website automatically regardless of the [full_page_scroll](#full_page_scroll) option value.
## Viewport
### viewport_device
**The default value is not set.**
Instead of manually specifying viewport parameters like width and height, you can specify a device to use for emulation. In addition, other parameters of the viewport, including the user agent, will be set automatically.
The `viewport_device` option sets the next options for you: [viewport_width](#viewport_width), [viewport_height](#viewport_height), [device_scale_factor](#device_scale_factor), [viewport_mobile](#viewport_mobile), [viewport_has_touch](#viewport_has_touch), [viewport_landscape](#viewport_landscape). You can change these options and override the ones set by the `viewport_device` option.
Use [the list of devices](/docs/viewport-devices/) for available values. Use the `id` property of the device as `viewport_device`, e.g. `viewport_device=galaxy_s9+_landscape`.
<Alert>
API does not use an actual device to take a screenshot. It is emulation that
works in most cases.
</Alert>
An example of the request URL with `viewport_device=iphone_13_pro_max_landscape`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?viewport_device=iphone_13_pro_max_landscape&url=https://tailwindcss.com&access_key=<your access key>

API](./viewport_width_and_height_example.png)
</Details>
### device_scale_factor
<Alert>
If the [viewport_device](#viewport_device) option is set, the parameter
overrides it!
</Alert>
Set the device scale factor, think of it as DPR (Device Pixel Ratio). The acceptable value is between the range of 1 and 5, including real numbers, like 2.25.
Set 2 if you need to render a screenshot with a higher pixel density like Apple's Retina Display.
The parameter can override the value set by [viewport_device](#viewport_device) option.

### image_width
The `image_width` and `image_height` parameters allow you to create a thumbnail of the screenshot.
By default `image_width` = [viewport_width](#viewport_width) and `image_height` = [viewport_height](#viewport_height).
If you specify image width and height parameters, the API will resize a screenshot, preserving the aspect ratio. The image will be resized to be as large as possible while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to the image width and height specified.
If you omit one of the parameters, the other is computed automatically, preserving the aspect ratio.
An example of the request with `image_width=500`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?image_width=500&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### image_height
The `image_width` and `image_height` parameters allow you to create a thumbnail of the screenshot.
By default `image_width` = [viewport_width](#viewport_width) and `image_height` = [viewport_height](#viewport_height).
If you specify image width and height parameters, the API will resize a screenshot, preserving the aspect ratio. The image will be resized to be as large as possible while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to the image width and height specified.

### scripts
`scripts` parameter allows to inject custom JavaScript and customize the page behavior.
An example of the request URL with `scripts=document.body.innerHTML="Hello, world!"`:
If the script might trigger a redirect by using window.location functions or something similar, it is required
to set [the "scripts_wait_until" option](#scripts_wait_until).
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?scripts=document.body.innerHTML="Hello,%20world!"&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<your access key>

</Details>
### scripts_wait_until
The default value of `scripts_wait_until` is `[]` — nothing, no wait at all.
The `scripts_wait_until` option allows you to wait until a given set of events after the [scripts](#scripts) were executed. You need to use in case, if your script might trigger page reloading, like:
```javascript
window.location = "https://example.com";
```
It accepts the same values as [wait_until](#wait_until) and can have multiple values:
-   `load`: the navigation is successful when the load even is fired;
-   `domcontentloaded`: the navigation is finished when the DOMContentLoaded even is fired;
-   `networkidle0`: the navigation is finished when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least 500 ms;
-   `networkidle2`: consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 2 network connections for at least 500 ms.
The parameter accepts many values. It means that screenshots will be taken after all events occur altogether.
An example of the request with `scripts_wait_until=networkidle2&scripts_wait_until=domcontentloaded`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?scripts_wait_until=networkidle2&scripts_wait_until=domcontentloaded&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>

### proxy
<Alert>If `proxy` is set, it overrides the `ip_country_code` option.</Alert>
You can use your custom proxy to take screenshots or render HTML with the `proxy` option.
It is suitable in many cases. For example, you might want to render a screenshot from the given location and check how the site renders for this location.
Only the `HTTP` proxies are supported.
If you need to specify username and password, use the usual URL format like: http://myuser:mypassword@example.com/.
Example of the request:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1080&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>

`cookies=name1=val1;+Domain=example.com;+Secure;+HttpOnly&cookies=name2=val2;+Domain=example.com;+Secure;+HttpOnly`
### headers
Set extra headers for the request in the format of `Header-Name:Header-Value`
Headers can override all other previously implicitly set headers by options like `cookies` or `authorization`.
You can specify multiple headers at once `headers=X-Header-1:Value-1&headers=X-Header-2:Value-2`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?headers=X-Header-1:Value-1&headers=X-Header-2:Value-2&url=http://myhttpheader.com/&access_key=<access key>
```

### bypass_csp
In rare cases, especially when you trying to add [custom scripts] to a website, you need to bypass the content security policies of the website. You need to simplify the set `bypass_csp` to `true`, by default it is `false`.
## Wait
These are one of the most tricky parameters when rendering screenshots of a site. Read on [how to wait until the page is ready](/blog/puppeteer-wait-until-the-page-is-ready/) if you are curious. Or use these `wait` options directly.
### wait_until
Use `wait_until` to wait until an event occurred before taking a screenshot or rendering HTML or PDF.
The default value of `wait_until` is `['load']`. Allowed values are:
-   `load`: the navigation is successful when the load even is fired;
-   `domcontentloaded`: the navigation is finished when the DOMContentLoaded even is fired;
-   `networkidle0`: the navigation is finished when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least 500 ms;
-   `networkidle2`: consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 2 network connections for at least 500 ms.
The parameter accepts many values. It means that screenshots will be taken after all events occur altogether.
An example of the request with `wait_until=networkidle2&wait_until=domcontentloaded`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?wait_until=networkidle2&wait_until=domcontentloaded&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### delay
Specify the `delay` option in seconds to wait before taking a screenshot or rendering HTML or PDF.
It is suitable when the [wait_until](#wait_until) option does not work well for you, and you want to ensure that everything is ready.
The default value is 0.
The delay value can be more than 30 seconds, only if [the timeout option](#timeout) is larger than 300 seconds which is only allowed for asynchronous requests.
An example of the request with `delay=5`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?delay=5&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### timeout
Specify `timeout` (in seconds) of when to abort the request if screenshot or rendering is still impossible. The default value is `60` seconds and the max value is `90`.
An example of the request with `timeout=20`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?timeout=20&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### navigation_timeout
Specify `navigation_timeout` (in seconds) of when to abort the request if the target site doesn't respond. The default and max value is `30`.
An example of the request with `navigation_timeout=20`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?navigation_timeout=20&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### wait_for_selector
<Alert>
If you are already screenshotting an element by the same selector, waiting
for a selector is not effective and won't be used.
</Alert>
Specify `wait_for_selector` to wait until the element appears in DOM, which is not necessarily visible.
If you specify a few selectors separated by commas, it will be enough to wait for only one. To change the behavior and wait
for all selectors, check out the [wait_for_selector_algorithm](#wait_for_selector_algorithm) option.
An example of the request with `wait_for_selector=.dynamically-loaded-element`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?wait_for_selector=.dynamically-loaded-element&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### wait_for_selector_algorithm
The default value is `at_least_one` that means to wait for at least one selector matched.
You can set it to `at_least_by_count` to wait for all selectors matched at least. But it doesn't mean all elements matched.
E.g. if you specify '.class1,.class2' and there are 2 elements in the DOM that match this selector, it will be enough to stop waiting.
It can also mean that there are 2 elements of `.class1`.
## Caching
:::note
**Screenshots are not cached by default.**
:::
Screenshots are cached by the combination of all specified request options. And the [cache_key](#cache_key) option allows having different cached versions of the same screenshot.
Cached screenshots are not counted by quota and are not logged anywhere. They are served directly from the cache. Screenshots are cached in a combination of Cloudflare CDN and R2 storage (like Amazon S3).
There is a header `x-screenshotone-cache-url` that provides a direct link to the cached image, PDF or video. The file exist as long as it was defined in the [cache_ttl](#cache_ttl) parameter when API request was performed with `cache=true`.
And if the `response_type` option is specified as `json`, you can find a cache URL in the JSON response too:
```json
{
"cache_url": "https://cache.screenshotone.com/..."
}
```
What is the benefit of using the cache URL?
1. You don't share API keys and don't complicate your code with [signed links](/docs/signed-requests/).
2. You control when to regenerate the cache, but a user with a link to the screenshot can't regenerate it. Because if you shared a link to an API request, once the cache is expired, it would be regenerated.
### cache
The `cache` option enables or disables caching of a screenshot, rendering HTML, or PDF. The default value is `false`.
The `false` option forces disabling caching and always generate a free screenshot or render HTML or PDF without caching.
An example of the request with `cache=false`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?cache=false&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### cache_ttl
The `cache` option must be set to `true` to use the `cache_ttl` parameter.
The `cache_ttl` option (in seconds) hints at how long the cached screenshot should be stored. The minimum value is `14400` seconds (4 hours), and the maximum value is `2592000` seconds (one month).
An example of the request with `cache_ttl=20000`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?cache=true&cache_ttl=20000&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### cache_key
The `cache` option must be set to `true` to use the `cache_key` parameter.
Screenshots are cached by the combination of all specified request options. The [cache_key](#cache_key) option allows having different cached versions of the same screenshot.
An example of the request with `cache_key=abc123`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?cache=true&cache_key=abc123&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
## Storing
<Alert>
When the [cache option](#cache) is set to true, the upload will be triggered
only on the cache miss. It means that if you want to upload screenshots
anytime, you take them, please set the [cache option](#cache) to false.
</Alert>
You can use any S3-compatible storage to store screenshots,
rendered HTML or PDF to the configured S3 bucket.
In case you don't care about getting the actual but only want to upload the rendering result to storage, specify [response_type=empty](#response_type).
An example of the request with `response_type=empty`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?response_type=empty&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### store
Default value is `false`. Use `store=true` to trigger upload of the taken screenshot, rendered HTML or
PDF to the configured S3 bucket. Make sure you configured [access to S3](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access).
An example of the request with `store=true`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?store=true&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### storage_path
The parameter is required if you set `store=true`. You must specify the key for the file, but don't
specify an extension, it will be added automatically based on the [format](#format) you specified.
You can also specify "subdirectories" in the path part.
An example of the request with `storage_path=latest/example`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?store=true&storage_path=latest/example&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### storage_endpoint
Leave empty for Amazon S3, specify only when needed. Any S3-compatible storage is supported, e.g. `"https://<accountId>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"` for Cloudlfare R2 storage.
### storage_access_key_id
Access key ID. It overrides the one specified in the dashboard configuration.
### storage_secret_access_key
Secret access key. It overrides the one specified in the dashboard configuration.
### storage_bucket
You can override the default bucket you configured with `storage_bucket=<bucket name>`.
An example of the request with `storage_bucket=temporary`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?storage_bucket=temporary&store=true&storage_path=latest/example&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### storage_class
The default value is `standard`.
Storage class allows you to specify [the object storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/).
Allowed values:
-   `standard`;
-   `reduced_redundancy`;
-   `standard_ia`;
-   `onezone_ia`;
-   `intelligent_tiering`;
-   `glacier`;
-   `deep_archive`;
-   `outposts`;
-   `glacier_ir`.
An example of the request with `storage_class=glacier_ir`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?storage_class=glacier_ir&store=true&storage_path=latest/example&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### storage_acl
The default value is not set.
Specify [the ACL value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) when uploading the file.
Allowed values:
-   (not set) (**default**);
-   `public-read`.
An example of the request with `storage_acl=public-read`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?storage_acl=public-read&store=true&storage_path=latest/example&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
### storage_return_location
You can require to return the file location returned by S3.
An example of the request with `storage_return_location=true`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?storage_return_location=true&store=true&storage_path=latest/example&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
You will receive the location as a header `X-ScreenshotOne-Store-Location` or if you set `response_type=json` as a property of JSON `store.location`.
## Metadata
You can extract different properties of the site or a screenshot on demand. They might impact performance, and that's why they are disabled by default.
### metadata_image_size
The default value is `false`.
Set to `true` to get the screenshot's actual image width and height. If response_type is set to `json`, you can get it from `metadata.image_size{width,height}` property. Otherwise, read from response headers such as `X-ScreenshotOne-Image-Width` and `X-ScreenshotOne-Image-Height`.
### metadata_fonts
The default value is `false`.
Get the fonts used by a website.
### metadata_icon
Get the favicon used by a website.
The default value is `false`.
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?metadata_icon=true&url=https://screenshotone.com/&access_key=<access key>
```
As headers:
```
X-ScreenshotOne-Icon: {"url":"https://screenshotone.com/favicon-32x32.png","type":"image/png"}
```
As JSON:
```json
{
"metadata": {
"icon": {
"url": "https://screenshotone.com/favicon-32x32.png",
"type": "image/png"
}
}
}
```
:::danger
Do not render the icon from the URL directly in your web application, it might be used to attack your site, always check and sanitize it.
Also, sometimes, it can return data URLs for the icon URL, like: `data:image/svg+xml,<svg...`.
:::
### metadata_open_graph
The default value is `false`.
If you set it to `true`, you can get the parsed Open Graph metadata either in the `x-screenshotone-open-graph` header, or in the JSON as the `metadata.open_graph` property.
```json
{
"metadata": {
"open_graph": {
"title": "The Screenshot API for developers",
"description": "ScreenshotOne is the best screenshot rendering platform for developers.",
"image": "https://screenshotone.com/og.png"
}
}
}
```
### metadata_page_title
The default value is `false`.
Get the title of the page.
Either in the `x-screenshotone-page-title` header, or in the JSON as the `metadata.page_title` property.
### metadata_content
You can request the content (HTML) of the page in addition to the screenshot. It will be uploaded to the ScreenshotOne CDN/public storage and you will receive the URL of the content and the date when it expires and is not available anymore.
If you don't use caching, then the API will use the minimum available [cache TTL](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#cache_ttl). Don't expect content URLs to be permanent and download the content as early and as fast as you can.
If the content is successfully extracted and uploaded, you will get the URL of the file in the header as `X-ScreenshotOne-Content-URL`. Also `X-ScreenshotOne-Content-Expires` header with the value when the content won't be available. The format of the expires header is the same as for the regular [Expires HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expires).
If you use JSON response type, then you will get it as:
```json
{
// ...
"content": {
"url": "https://example.com/...",
"expires": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT"
}
// ...
}
```
On rare occasions if there is an error or some problem of fetching HTML content of the page, you won't get that data, then it is recommended to perform one more request but use [an HTML format instead](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#format).
The default value is `false`.
Consider including the shadow DOM elements with the [`include_shadow_dom`](#include_shadow_dom) option.
### metadata_http_response_status_code
Set to `true` to get the host HTTP response headers.
If you render a binary screenshot, not JSON, you can get that data from the API response headers as `X-ScreenshotOne-HTTP-Response-Status-Code`.
In JSON, it will look like:
```json
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?
&url=https://example.com/
...
&metadata_http_response_headers=true
&metadata_http_response_status_code=true
{
...
"http_response": {
"status_code": 200,
"headers": {
"accept-ranges": "bytes",
"age": "56658",
"cache-control": "max-age=604800",
"content-encoding": "gzip",
"content-length": "648",
"content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",
"date": "Fri, 02 Aug 2024 10:26:35 GMT",
"etag": "\"3147526947\"",
"expires": "Fri, 09 Aug 2024 10:26:35 GMT",
"last-modified": "Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT",
"server": "ECAcc (nyd/D13E)",
"vary": "Accept-Encoding",
"x-cache": "HIT"
}
}
...
}
```
### metadata_http_response_status_headers
Set to `true` to get the host HTTP response status code.
If you render a binary screenshot, not JSON, you can get that data from the API response headers as `X-ScreenshotOne-HTTP-Response-Headers`.
In JSON, it will look like:
```json
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?
&url=https://example.com/
...
&metadata_http_response_headers=true
&metadata_http_response_status_code=true
{
...
"http_response": {
"status_code": 200,
"headers": {
"accept-ranges": "bytes",
"age": "56658",
"cache-control": "max-age=604800",
"content-encoding": "gzip",
"content-length": "648",
"content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",
"date": "Fri, 02 Aug 2024 10:26:35 GMT",
"etag": "\"3147526947\"",
"expires": "Fri, 09 Aug 2024 10:26:35 GMT",
"last-modified": "Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT",
"server": "ECAcc (nyd/D13E)",
"vary": "Accept-Encoding",
"x-cache": "HIT"
}
}
...
}
```
## Async and Webhooks
### async
You can execute any request asynchronously by setting the `async` option to `true`. The API will return an empty response immediately. It is `false` by default.
Usually, it is in [combination with webhooks](/docs/async-and-webhooks/) to [upload rendered screenshots or PDFs to S3](/docs/upload-to-s3/).
### webhook_url
You can receive the result of the screenshot execution at your desired URL. To do it, specify the `webhook_url` parameter. E.g. `webhook_url=https://example.com`.
Usually, it is in [combination with async](/docs/async-and-webhooks/) to [upload rendered screenshots or PDFs to S3](/docs/upload-to-s3/).
### webhook_sign
Signing webhook request body takes time. If you are sure that your webhooks are unique and secret, you might want to disable signing to improve performance by using `webhook_sign=false`.
It is `true` by default.
## Error options
### ignore_host_errors
When the site responds within the range of 200-299 status code, you can ignore errors and take a screenshot of the error page anyway. To do that, set the option `ignore_host_errors` to true. It is `false` by default.
It is helpful when you want to create a gallery of error pages or, for some reason, you need to render error pages.
### error_on_selector_not_found
If [a selector](#selector) or a [scroll_into_view option](#scroll_into_view) is specified and `error_on_selector_not_found=true`, the error will be returned if the element by selector is not visible or it took more than `timeout` seconds to render it, but not more than 30 seconds.
Default value is `false`.
### fail_if_request_failed
The option forces the request to fail if any network request fails during page loading. By default, it is not specified, which means the screenshot will be taken even if some resources (like images, scripts, or stylesheets) fail to load.
Setting `fail_if_request_failed` is useful when you need to ensure that all resources are properly loaded before taking a screenshot. This can help identify issues with missing assets or network problems.
An example of the API request that will fail if any request URL that matches *example.com* fails:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<access key>&fail_if_request_failed=*example.com*&url=https://example.com/
```
Failed requests are not counted against your rendering quota.
### fail_if_content_missing
The option forces the request to fail if the specified text is missing on the page content. Case insensitive.
It can be specified multiple times. And the request will fail if any of the specified strings is missing on the page content.
Failed requests are not counted against your rendering quota.
### fail_if_content_contains
The option forces the request to fail if the specified text is matched on the page content. Case insensitive.
It can be specified multiple times. And the request will fail if any of the specified strings is matched on the page content.
Check out the guide on [how to fail rendering if the content contains a string](/docs/guides/fail-if-content-contains/) for more details.
Failed requests are not counted against your rendering quota.
### fail_if_gpu_rendering_fails
The options forces the request to fail if GPU rendering fails. Otherwise, the request will be retried. Or sent to the CPU-based rendering services.

# Signature Invalid
It is an API error returned when the provided signature parameter is not valid.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "signature_is_not_valid",
"error_message": "You provided the `signature` parameter, but it is not valid. Make sure you use the correct signing algorithm—https://screenshotone.com/docs/signed-requests/.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/signature-is-invalid/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Incorrect Signing Algorithm
The most common reason for the "signature_is_not_valid" error is using an incorrect signing algorithm to generate the signature.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Verify signing algorithm**: Ensure you are using the correct signing algorithm as specified in the [signed requests documentation](https://screenshotone.com/docs/signed-requests/).
2. **Check signature generation code**: Review your code that generates the signature to ensure it follows the correct algorithm and procedure.
### Mismatched Signature
The signature provided in the request might not match the expected signature due to data mismatches or incorrect key usage.
To fix this, consider:
1. **Verify request data**: Ensure that all data used to generate the signature matches the data sent in the request.
2. **Use correct secret key**: Ensure that the correct secret key is used to generate the signature.
### Signature Formatting Issues
Formatting issues, such as encoding problems or extra characters, can lead to an invalid signature.
To fix this, verify that the signature is correctly formatted and encoded as required by the API.
### Debugging Signature Issues
If you are still encountering issues, you can use debugging tools or logging to trace the signature generation process and identify where it might be going wrong.
## Reach out to support
If you continue to face issues or need further assistance, please reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will assist you as soon as possible.
# Storage Returned Transient Error
It is an API error returned when the storage server returns a transient error and retries have been exhausted.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "storage_returned_transient_error",
"error_message": "The storage returned an HTTP status code between 500 and 599 and we exhausted retries. You can likely retry the request again.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/storage-returned-transient-error/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Transient Storage Server Error
The most common reason for the "storage_returned_transient_error" is that the S3 storage returned an HTTP status code between 500 and 599, indicating a transient error.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Retry the request**: Since the error is transient, retrying the request after a short wait is often effective.
2. **Check storage service status**: Verify the status of the storage service you are using to see if there are any ongoing issues or maintenance that might be causing the error.
### Exhausted Retries
The API has attempted to retry the request multiple times but has exhausted its retry limit.
To fix this, consider implementing additional retries on your end, with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the storage server.
### Temporary Network Issues
Temporary network issues can also cause transient errors from the storage server.
To fix this, ensure that your network connection is stable and retry the request.
## Reach out to support
If you continue to face issues or need further assistance, please reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will assist you as soon as possible.
# Signature Required
It is an API error returned when the signature parameter is missing in the request.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "signature_is_required",
"error_message": "The `signature` parameter is required. Because signing requests is required in the access page—https://dash.screenshotone.com/access. Make sure you use the correct signing algorithm—https://screenshotone.com/docs/signed-requests/.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/signature-is-required/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### Missing Signature Parameter
The most common reason for the "signature_is_required" error is that the `signature` parameter is not included in the request. This parameter is mandatory for authenticating and authorizing the API request if on the [access dashboard page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access) forcing signing requests is activated.
To fix this, ensure that you include the `signature` parameter in your API request.
### Programmatic Issues
If you are dynamically generating requests (e.g., through a script or application), there might be a bug causing the `signature` to be omitted.
To fix this, debug your script or application to ensure the `signature` is being properly set and included in every API request.
### Request Validation
To ensure your request is valid, double-check all parameters and the generated signature before sending the request to the API.
## Reach out to support
If you continue to face issues or need further assistance, please reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will assist you as soon as possible.
# Timeout Error
It is an API error returned when the API can't render screenshots or video within the specified timeout:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "timeout_error",
"error_message": "The screenshot couldn't be taken within the specified timeout. Either the site doesn't respond quickly, or rendering takes longer than expected. Play with the `timeout` or the `navigation_timeout` options or reach the support for the investigation.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
Let's quickly consider possible reasons and possible solutions.
### Timeout is too small
By default, the timeout is about 60 seconds. You must fit your rendering request within that timeout.
You can:
Either use asynchronous requests and webhooks to get the results. And set the timeout up to 300 seconds.
Or you can try to increase the timeout up to 90 seconds.
### Delay is too big
Make sure that your delay is not too big, e.g. if you set it to 30 seconds, and it takes the website to load for 30 seconds, it is better to decrease the delay.
### A website is not loading properly
Some sites just take too much time to load or they don't emit DOMContentLoaded events.
Try to play with different values of [the wait_until option]() and see if it helps.
### Long duration of the video
Often when you record a video of a long duration, the API must not respond in time. Since it takes to both record a video and stream it.
Try to decrease the video duration you are recording, it might help.

# Temporary Unavailable
It is an API error returned when the API is temporarily unavailable due to an error or overload.
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "temporary_unavailable",
"error_message": "The API is temporarily unavailable due to an error or overload. Please wait a bit and then safely retry your request.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/temporary-unavailable/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
### API Overload
One common reason for the "temporary_unavailable" error is that the API is overloaded with requests, causing temporary unavailability.
To fix this, you can:
1. **Wait and retry**: Wait for a short period and then retry your request. The API should become available once the load decreases.
2. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting on your end to avoid overwhelming the API with too many requests in a short period.
### Temporary Errors
Temporary errors or issues within the API infrastructure can also cause this error.
To fix this, consider:
1. **Retry the request**: Since the issue is temporary, retrying the request after a brief wait is often effective.
2. **Monitor status page**: Check [the API status page](https://status.screenshotone.com/) to see if there are any ongoing issues.
### Scheduled Maintenance
The API might be undergoing scheduled maintenance, leading to temporary unavailability.
### Network Issues
Network issues between your system and the API server can also result in this error.
To fix this, ensure your network connection is stable and retry the request.
## Implementing Retry Logic
Implementing retry logic in your application can help handle temporary unavailability gracefully. Use exponential backoff strategy for retries to avoid overwhelming the API further.
## Reach out to support
If you continue to face issues or need further assistance, please reach out to `support@screenshotone.com`, and we will assist you as soon as possible.
# Usage Quota Exceeded
It is an API error returned when the monthly usage quota has been exceeded:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "screenshots_limit_reached",
"error_message": "The usage quota has been exceeded. Please, either upgrade to a plan with more quota or change the maximum allowed limit (if possible) in the ScreenshotOne dashboard. If it is a mistake, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com.`",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/usage-quota-exceeded/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
There is a few ways on how to fix the error:
1. If you use a free plan, you need to upgrade to a paid plan. You can do that at [the Dashboard Billing page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/billing).
2. If you are already a paying customer, please, consider upgrade to a higher plan.
3. Or you can [request extra quota](/docs/charging-extra/).

# Storage Access Denied
It is an API error returned when the API can't upload a screenshot your S3 storage because the access is denined:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_message": "Failed to upload the screenshot to the storage since access was denied. Check the API keys you specify when using the storage integration.",
"error_code": "storage_access_denied",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/storage-access-denied/"
}
```
## Reasons and how to fix
Let's quickly consider possible reasons and possible solutions.
### Perform configuration testing
In [the dashboard](https://dash.screenshotone.com/integrations/s3), you can test configuration and get the detailed error description:
![Configuration Testing](configuration_testing.jpg)
### Check credentials and URL
Make sure and double check that all your credentials and the storage URL is correct.

# How to render Google Slides as scrolling screenshots with ScreenshotOne
import Video from "@/components/Video.astro";
By default, you can not render Google Slides as scrolling screenshots with the ScreenshotOne API. But if you managed to export it as HTML, you can make it work.
## Make Google Slides available as HTML
To make Google Slides available as HTML, you need to export it as HTML from the Google Slides editor.
I created [a simple example Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fsaM1LaLUEzNn9pTPRdY0XBz1WxaFcWBD2WY50SrqwY/edit?usp=sharing) to demonstrate how to do that.
(1) For you presentation, go to share settings:
![The Google Slides share settings](./google-slides-share-settings.png)
(2) Change the settings to make the presentation public and shareable:
![The Google Slides share settings](./google-slides-share-settings-make-public.png)
After that you can use either Google Slides API or make the link shareable and public to everyone and then modify it to the link like:
`https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/<presentation id>/export/html`
Download the HTML with any HTTP client, but the following example uses is written in TypeScript:
```typescript
// validate URL
const presentationUrl = new URL(url);
if (!presentationUrl.hostname.includes("docs.google.com")) {
throw new Error("Invalid URL: Must be a Google Slides presentation URL");
}
// Extract presentation ID from the Google Slides URL
const match = presentationUrl.pathname.match(/presentation\/d\/([\w-]+)/);
if (!match) {
throw new Error("Invalid Google Slides URL format");
}
const presentationId = match[1];
const exportUrl = `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/${presentationId}/export/html`;
url = exportUrl;
console.log(`Downloading Google Slides presentation from: ${url}`);
const response = await axios.get(url, {
headers: {
"User-Agent":
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
},
maxContentLength: Infinity,
maxBodyLength: Infinity,
timeout: 60000, // increase timeout to 60 seconds
});
const html = response.data;
if (typeof html !== "string") {
throw new Error("Failed to get HTML content from Google Slides: Response data is not a string");
}
```
## Render HTML as scrolling screenshots
Get your ScreenshotOne API key at the [ScreenshotOne dashboard](https://dashboard.screenshotone.com/).
And then implement the following example in TypeScript or any other language you want:
```typescript
// Prepare ScreenshotOne API parameters
const params: Record<string, string> = {
html: html,
access_key: SCREENSHOTONE_ACCESS_KEY as string,
format: "mp4",
scenario: "scroll",
delay: "2", // wait for 2 seconds before starting to scroll
};
const apiUrl = `https://api.screenshotone.com/animate`;
console.log("Making request to ScreenshotOne API...");
// Make request to ScreenshotOne API
const screenshotResponse = await axios({
method: "post",
url: apiUrl,
data: params,
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
responseType: "stream",
maxContentLength: Infinity,
maxBodyLength: Infinity,
timeout: 60000, // increase timeout to 60 seconds
});
// Process the video
```
Notice that we use a POST HTTP request to the `https://api.screenshotone.com/animate` endpoint. Because the request might be large and might not fit into the URL.
The resulting video will be something like:
<Video url="/videos/google-slides-scrolling-screenshot.mp4" />
## A working example
You can find a fully working example (written in Node.js/TypeScript) in the [ScreenshoOne integration examples directory](https://github.com/screenshotone/examples/tree/main/nodejs/google-slides-scrolling-screenshots).
## Suggestions
1. If possible, use the official Google Slides API to get the HTML. It is more reliable and easier to use.
2. If you build this solution for third-party use, consider if you can automate the processing of authentication with Google Slides and extract the HTML.
## Support

# How to screenshot an area of a site
import Alert from "@/components/Alert.astro";
When rendering website screenshots with the ScreenshotOne Screenshot API, you can specify [clip options](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#clip) to render only a specific area of the website.
<Alert>You must specify all clip options, otherwise, it won't work.</Alert>
For example, let's clip a square of the ScreenshotOne landing page:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your api key>&url=https://screenshotone.com&clip_x=100&clip_y=100&clip_width=500&clip_height=500
```
The resulting image will be:
![A clip example](./clip_example.png)
In case you can rely on a selector, it is better to use [the selector option](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#selector) than precise coordinates. It will allow you to produce more stable results. But in case you know what you do and prefer to rely on specific coordinates, it is OK to use clip options.
A few typical uses of the feature:
1. **Content Monitoring**. Businesses can use this feature to monitor their website's content regularly, ensuring that updates are correctly deployed and that there are no visual anomalies or layout issues.
2. **Competitor Analysis**. Companies can clip and analyze key sections of competitors' websites, such as product pages or promotional banners, to stay informed about market trends and competitor strategies.
3. **QA Testing**. Web developers and QA teams can automate the process of taking screenshots of different sections of a webpage across various devices and browsers for testing purposes, ensuring consistency and identifying layout issues.
Enjoy it. If you have any questions, please, feel free to send an email to `support.screenshotone.com`.
# How to use proxies
ScreenshotOne doesn't include rotating residential proxies as part of the product, but you can plug in easily any external proxy provider you like, in three simple steps.
:::tip[Did you know?]
If you need to use proxies to bypass CAPTCHAs, [check out our guide on how to bypass CAPTCHAs](/docs/guides/how-to-bypass-captchas).
:::
## 1. Sign up to a proxy provider
There are plenty of them, like [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com/), [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/), or [Geonode](https://geonode.com/).
You can find the Internet proxy providers that you prefer by price and quality. Choose and sign up for the proxy provider.
Not because it is the best one or the cheapest one, but in this guide, I will use [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com/) as an example.
## 2. Get the proxy URL
Choose pay-as-you-go residential proxies in Smartproxy or any other proxy provider you picked in the previous step.
And your goal is to copy the HTTP URL of the proxy with the desired configuration.
In the case of Smartproxy, it would look like:
![An example of picking the HTTP proxy endpoint in Smartproxy](smartproxy.jpg).
## 3. Use the proxy with the ScreenshotOne API
Once you have the HTTP proxy URL, not HTTPS, nor SOCKS5. You can specify it when sending an API request with the [proxy](/docs/options/#proxy) parameter, just like this:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?proxy=<your proxy url>&access_key=<your API key>&url=<the site you want to screenshot>
```
Where `<your proxy url>` is your proxy URL, or in the case of our example is `http://user12345:somepass@us.smartproxy.com:10000`.
## Recommendations
A few tips to improve your success rate when using proxies:
1. **Don't use random proxies.** Use proxies located in the United States or your specific location, rather than random locations. For most proxy providers, stability is unlikely when using random locations.
2. **Don't send many requests through the same proxy.** If you plan to send many requests in parallel through the same proxy, consider using different ports if available or even different proxies. Using a single channel is highly likely to slow down your API requests, cause timeouts, and result in more errors.
## Reach out if anything
You see, it was that easy. In case if you have any questions or encounter any problems, please, don't hesitate to reach out at `support@screenshotone.com`.
# How to translate and render a website as a screenshot
It is possible to translate and take a screenshot of the translated website with ScreenshotOne because the API supports scripts via the `scripts` option.
You can use any translation API of your choice. But as an example, in this guide, I will go with Google Translate API.
## Get your Google Translate API key
To get your Google API key:
1. Go to [the API credentials page in Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Generate your API key and make sure you restrict it to using only for Google Translate.
3. Make sure you set budgets, and notifications, and follow other [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/four-best-practices-for-translating-your-website) for Google Translate.
## Write a script to translate your websites
You need to write a script that efficiently will check all text nodes on the website, batch them, and send requests efficiently to save your costs.
:::danger
Please, make sure to optimize the script for your use case and that it doesn't overuse your quota. It is an example script and ScreenshotOne is not responsible for you using it and causing any damage to your business by the script. Use it at your own risk.
:::
Here is an example script you can try and use as a basis, but I highly recommend writing yours for production and making sure it has retries and other necessary logic:
```javascript
const translateTextAsync = async (texts, targetLang, apiKey) => {
const url = `https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?key=${apiKey}`;
const data = {
q: texts,
target: targetLang,
};
const response = await fetch(url, {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Network response was not ok.");
const json = await response.json();
return json.data.translations.map((t) => t.translatedText);
};
const isVisible = (element) => {
return element.offsetWidth > 0 && element.offsetHeight > 0;
};
const shouldTranslate = (node) => {
return (
node.nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE &&
node.nodeValue.trim() &&
isVisible(node.parentElement) &&
!isDescendantOf(node, ["script", "code"])
);
};
const isDescendantOf = (node, tagNames) => {
let parent = node.parentElement;
while (parent && parent !== document.body) {
if (tagNames.includes(parent.tagName.toLowerCase())) {
return true;
}
parent = parent.parentElement;
}
return false;
};
const batchTranslate = async (nodes, targetLang, apiKey) => {
let batch = [];
let totalLength = 0;
const results = [];
for (const node of nodes) {
const text = node.nodeValue.trim();
if (text.length + totalLength > 5000 || batch.length >= 128) {
// Translate current batch
const translations = await translateTextAsync(
batch,
targetLang,
apiKey
);
translations.forEach((translatedText, index) => {
results.push({ node: nodes[index], translatedText });
});
// Reset for next batch
batch = [text];
totalLength = text.length;
} else {
batch.push(text);
totalLength += text.length;
}
}
// Translate remaining batch
if (batch.length > 0) {
const translations = await translateTextAsync(
batch,
targetLang,
apiKey
);
translations.forEach((translatedText, index) => {
results.push({
node: nodes[nodes.length - batch.length + index],
translatedText,
});
});
}
return results;
};
const translatePageContent = async (element, targetLang, apiKey) => {
const textNodes = [];
const walker = document.createTreeWalker(
element,
NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT,
{
acceptNode: (node) => {
return shouldTranslate(node)
? NodeFilter.FILTER_ACCEPT
: NodeFilter.FILTER_REJECT;
},
},
false
);
let node;
while ((node = walker.nextNode())) {
textNodes.push(node);
}
const translations = await batchTranslate(textNodes, targetLang, apiKey);
translations.forEach(({ node, translatedText }) => {
node.nodeValue = translatedText;
});
};
// Replace with your actual API key
const apiKey = "<your API key>";
// Target language code (e.g., 'es' for Spanish)
const targetLang = "es";
translatePageContent(document.body, targetLang, apiKey)
.then(() => console.log("Translation completed"))
.catch((error) => console.error("Translation error:", error));
```
## Rendered translated websites
Once you have a working script, make sure you URL-encode it and then send it to ScreenshotOne when rendering a screenshot. You can use either POST or GET requests.
But in this example, I will share with you a GET request example:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your API key>&url=https://example.com&scripts=<URL-encoded script>&delay=10
```
You can see the example.com website rendered in the Spanish language:
![The example.com website rendered in the Spanish language](example.com.spanish.jpeg)
I hope the guide helps you translate and render any HTML or website content, and have a nice day!
# Fail rendering if the content contains a string
There is a set of use cases when you want to fail screenshot rendering and retry it if the content of the page contains a string.
For example, if you use residential rotating proxies and a site blocks you with some specific test, you might want to retry the request instead of getting the successful screenshot of the page with the CAPTCHA or an error.
:::tip[Did you know?]
You don't pay for failed and cached screenshots with ScreenshotOne.
:::
That's exactly what you need the option `fail_if_content_contains` for.
Let's quickly see how it works and how you can use it. Let's first render the example.com page:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com
```
The result is:
![The example.com website](example.com.png)
Now, let's try to fail it:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?fail_if_content_contains=Illustrative+Examples+In+Documents&access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com
```
The result is:
```json
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_message": "The page content contains the specified string by the `fail_if_content_contains` option. If it seems to be a mistake or not what you expected, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` as quickly as possible, and will assist and try to resolve your problem.",
"error_code": "content_contains_specified_string",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/content-contains-specified-string/"
}
```
As you might notice, the match is case insensitive, it is done for simplicity.
You can also specify multiple strings to fail if any of them is matched on the page content:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?fail_if_content_contains=Prior&fail_if_content_contains=Example&access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com
```
## A few more similar options

# How to bypass CAPTCHAs
Since the the launch of ScreenshotOne API, it was designed to perform ethical screenshotting, hence the ScreenshotOne API doesn't support bypassing CAPTCHAs, by default.
However, if you need to do that, and you know what you are doing within the legal boundaries, you can use a third-party services as a proxy with ScreenshotOne API.
For, example [Web Unlocker by Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/products/web-unlocker) is a service that can be used to bypass CAPTCHAs as a proxy.
## Web Unlocker by Bright Data
[Brigh Data Web Unlocker](https://brightdata.com/products/web-unlocker) solution has `pay-as-you-go` pricing model, and it is a great way to bypass CAPTCHAs if you need to.
However, be aware that the API response time might be slower than the normal one, and sometimes the requests even might fail. It relates to how proxies operate and depends on the stability of the proxy provider.
### 1. Create the Web Unlocker proxy
To create the Web Unlocker proxy, sign up to [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/), and once you log in, choose `Web Unlocker` from the "Add" menu:
![The Bright Data Dashboard](dashboard.png)
Make sure to enable the CAPTCHA solver and premium domains if needed:
![The Web Unlocker creation screen](create.png)
Once created, you can choose the Node.js code example and copy the proxy URL:
![The Web Unlocker code example](proxy_url.png)
### 2. Use the Web Unlocker proxy with the ScreenshotOne API
In this example, the proxy URL is:
```
http://brd-customer-hl_99a0bd97-zone-your_unlocker_name:can1v3iuf18x@brd.superproxy.io:22225
```
Now, you can use this proxy URL in the ScreenshotOne API request:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?key=<YOUR API KEY>&url=https://example.com&proxy=http://brd-customer-hl_99a0bd97-zone-your_unlocker_name:can1v3iuf18x@brd.superproxy.io:22225
```
## Residential proxies
It is worth to mention, that using residential proxies might also prevent CAPTCHAs from even showing up. Check out our guide on [how to use proxies](/docs/guides/how-to-use-proxies) to learn more.
It happens because with the residential IP addresses, usually there is no need to even show CAPTCHAs, since it looks like that the requests are coming from real users, not bots.
## Cost optimizations
To save money on proxies, you can try to use the option [fail_if_content_contains](/docs/options/#fail_if_content_contains) to fail the request if the content contains a certain string that might hint you that there is a CAPTCHA on the page.
The option returns a specific error code like:
```
{
"is_successful": false,
"error_code": "content_contains_specified_string",
"error_message": "The page content contains the specified string by the `fail_if_content_contains` option. If it seems to be a mistake or not what you expected, please, reach out to `support@screenshotone.com` as quickly as possible, and we will assist and try to resolve your problem.",
"documentation_url": "https://screenshotone.com/docs/errors/content-contains-specified-string/"
}
```
Since you don't pay for the failed requests, you can only then retry the request with the same parameters, but with the proxy that bypasses CAPTCHAs.

# Upload to S3
You can use [ScreenshotOne screenshot API](https://screenshotone.com/) to take website screenshots and upload them directly to Amazon S3 and any other S3-compatible storage like [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/), [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/), and others.
I will guide through a few simple steps of how you can do it.
Today's UI for Amazon AWS console or ScreenshotOne might be a bit different, and things can change after a while, but you should sense the overall approach from the post you need to apply to make it work.
If you are familiar with AWS, you can go straight away to [configure access to S3 in ScreenshotOne](#configure-access-to-s3-in-screenshotone).
## Prepare the bucket and credentials
Open the [S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and click on the "Create bucket" button:
![Create bucket](create_bucket_button.png)
Type the bucket name, choose a region, and other important for you settings:
![A bucket form](create_bucket_form.png)
Now, let's create access keys to upload to the S3 bucket.
:::danger
Never, ever, don't share the access key to your main account with ScreenshotOne or another service. Create an IAM user with as narrow access as possible and share its keys.
:::
> [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.
Before creating a user, we will create a narrow policy to restrict access to the bucket we created and only for putting objects into it.
> You manage access in AWS by creating [policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied.
Open [the IAM management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), navigate to "Policies", then click on the "Create policy" button. And one the following screen, select `S3` as a service, then allow only `PutObject` operation for the bucket with the name `screenshotone`:
![Create policy](policy_s3_put_object.png)
After clicking on the "Create policy" button and entering the policy name:
![Create policy](policy_s3_review_policy.png)
I gave a clear name to the policy as an example. You can provide whatever you like.
Then open [the IAM management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) again and navigate to users. Once you are here, click on the "Add users" button:
![Add users](iam_console.png)
After that, type username and select "Access key - Programmatic access":
![Username and credentials](username_and_access.png)
We need to select and attach the policy we created earlier to the user:
![Select policy](select_policy.png)
The user is primarily ready, so we can skip the following steps and get to the end, where we can see credentials:
![Credentials](user_is_created.png)
Copy the credentials and store them in safe place like password manager. We will need them in the next step to configure ScreenshotOne to upload screenshots.
I will save the credentials for our example to use in the next section:
```
Access key ID: AKIAURGNZP6VM5HASWIF
Secret access key: wVd8OgAnGIEdlQaWxDwzVcOQNO03G1dgFiDyHLPT
```
## Configure access to S3 in ScreenshotOne
:::caution
If you haven't created the bucket in the `us-east-1` AWS region, please, specify your bucket region through an endpoint in a format like `https://s3.<your-region>.amazonaws.com`.
:::
You can set credentials ([Access Key ID](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storage_access_key_id) and [Secret Access Key](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storage_secret_access_key)) when sending an API request or you cat to go to the [access page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access). And put all the credentials you got from Amazon AWS for S3 into the "S3 access" configuration form:
![Access page](access_page.png)
I specified the default bucket, but you can use many buckets to upload screenshots and then override the target bucket with [the storage_bucket option](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storage_bucket) when using API. But for example, I use only one bucket—it is enough.
## Take a website screenshot through API with `storing` options
ScreenshotOne API has [a bunch of options related to uploading screenshots to S3 storage](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storing):
-   [store](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#store) triggers upload of the taken screenshot, rendered HTML or PDF to the configured S3 bucket.
-   [storage_path](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storage_path)—specifies the key for the file, but not an extension. The extension will be added automatically based on the specified [format](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#format).
-   [storage_bucket](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storage_bucket)—overrides the default bucket configured in the [access page](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access).
-   [storage_class](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#storage_class)—allows to specify [the object storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/).
Let's take a screenshot and upload it to S3:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=0MpjJxw8Vk7ZAw&url=https://nextjs.org&store=true&storage_path=nextjs.org
```
The result is:
![Next.js](nextjs.org.jpg)
And let's check S3:
![S3 results](s3_nextjs.png)
In case you don't need to return the resulting image and speed up uploading, add `response_type=empty` to the request:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=0MpjJxw8Vk7ZAw&url=https://example.com&store=true&storage_path=example.com&response_type=empty
```
The result is a white screen—zero bytes sent from the ScrenshotOne API in response. And let's again check that the screenshot is uploaded:
![S3 results](s3_all.png)
That's it. But if you want to do it asynchronously?
## Async and Webhooks
ScreenshotOne supports [asynchronous screenshot rendering and webhooks](/docs/async-and-webhooks/). You can upload your screenshots to S3 asynchronously without waiting and then receive the resulting upload URL to your server.
To do that, specify additional parameters `async`, `webhook_url`, `storage_return_location`. And only JSON response type is supported.
So the full request might look like:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=0MpjJxw8Vk7ZAw&url=https://example.com&store=true&storage_path=example.com&response_type=json&async=true&webhook_url=https://example.com&storage_return_location=true
```
Read more about [asynchronous screenshot rendering and webhooks](/docs/async-and-webhooks/).
## Why upload to S3
I don't know your use case and would be happy to know it, but there are a few reasons why customers of ScreenshotOne upload website screenshots to S3.
One is to use CDN that pulls images from S3 storage, and the other is to archive screenshots, process them later, or even compare them.
## Instead of summary
It makes me happy to help people solve their problems. And even happier when people pay for that. I hope today I solved yours. Have a good day or even night, and be happy 👌
# How to handle API errors
Error handling is an essential part of any high-quality application. Make sure you handle all errors returned by the ScreenshotOne API correctly and provide informative explanations to your customers or react to them accordingly.
## Following HTTP standards
The ScreenshotOne API is on-purpose built using HTTP protocol and follows HTTP standards as much as possible. To make sure the API will be stable and can support customers for years to come.
In general, if the resulting status code is in the range of 400-599, then we are dealing with errors.
```
GET https://api.screenshotone.com/?[options]
Content-Type: application/json
{
"is_successful":false,
"error_code": "an_error_code",
"error_message": "An error message"
}
```
## Errors caused by API consumers
All errors caused by invalid requests, absent credentials, or any reasons caused by you, an API consumer, are marked with status codes 400-499. It means, that until you find a way to fix them, the request won't be executed successfully.
## API internal errors
Errors with status codes in the range 500-599 are caused by the API internal reasons and you have almost little influence over that.
But you can safely retry them.
Except in a few cases. When you get a network error (`network_error`), it might be because the site blocks the API, and there is no sense in retrying the request. Or if the site returned an error (`host_returned_error`) and it is an error within the range 400-499, it means that the API is either blocked, or you need to change the request to the site.
You still might want to try to retry errors like `network_error` and `host_returned_error` (if the host's error is `403` in the `returned_status_code` property of the response), but try to add a residential rotating proxy to that API request. Maybe the second time you can succeed and the request will work for you.
An example of the code that retries the request with a residential rotating proxy:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(
"https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://example.com&access_key=..."
);
if (!response.ok) {
const error = await response.json();
if (
// add more error codes
error.error_code === "network_error" ||
(error.error_code === "host_returned_error" && error.returned_status_code == 403)
) {
const proxy = "http://...";
const proxyResponse = await fetch(
`https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://example.com&access_key=...&proxy=${proxy}`
);
if (!proxyResponse.ok) {
const proxyError = await proxyResponse.json();
// you can try to retry again
}
// the retry was sucessful
const screenshot = await proxyResponse.blob();
}
}
```
## Showing errors to your end users
In general, you can try to just return the error message provided by the API, but if you want to show a more user-friendly message, you can use the following code:
```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.screenshotone.com/...");
// after retries and other processing, once you decide to show an error to your end user
if (!response.ok) {
const errorData = await response.json();
const errorMessage = generateUserFriendlyErrorMessage(errorData);
// show the error to your end user in your UI, CLI or any other way
showErrorToUser(errorMessage);
}
function generateUserFriendlyErrorMessage(error) {
// these are error messages for your public users, not for you
switch (error.error_code) {
case "screenshots_limit_reached":
return "The screenshot rendering is not available. Please, retry later.";
case "concurrency_limit_reached":
case "temporary_unavailable":
return "Please try again in a moment.";
case "request_not_valid":
return "Please, make sure your request is valid and try again.";
case "selector_not_found":
return "The target element was not found on the page";
case "name_not_resolved":
return "Unable to resolve the domain name. Check that there is no typo in the URL. If this is a new site, please wait for DNS propagation.";
case "network_error":
return "Unable to connect to the requested URL. The site may be blocking access or temporarily down.";
case "host_returned_error":
if ([401, 403, 429].includes(error.returned_status_code)) {
return "The target website blocks automated screenshot rendering.";
}
if (error.returned_status_code >= 500) {
return "The target website is temporarily down. Please, retry later.";
}
if (error.returned_status_code == 404) {
return "The target website returned a 404 HTTP error—the page not found.";
}
return `The target website returned a ${error.returned_status_code} HTTP error.`;
case "timeout_error":
return "The screenshot rendering timed out. Please, try again.";
case "storage_returned_transient_error":
case "internal_application_error":
case "request_aborted":
return "Failed to render the screenshot. Please try your request again";
case "access_key_required":
case "access_key_invalid":
case "signature_is_required":
case "signature_is_not_valid":
case "invalid_storage_configuration":
case "script_triggers_redirect":
case "storage_access_denied":
case "content_contains_specified_string":
case "invalid_cookie_parameter":
case "resulting_image_too_large":
// these are errors that often are not caused by the end user action,
// and they need to be fixed on your or our side
return "The screenshot rendering failed. Please, reach out to support.";
default:
// return a generic error message
// or the message provided by the API error.error_message
return "The screenshot rendering failed. Please, reach out to support.";
}
}
```
These are the most common errors often caused by end users. If you want to process more codes, check out [all  our errors](/docs/errors/).
## Reporting errors
All ScreenshotOne API errors are logged and we are acknowledged by them. And will react to them as fast as possible.
In general, you don't need to report to us any errors. But if it blocks your work or you want us to prioritize fixing them, please, feel free to report an error at `support@screenshotone.com`.
## Error reference
All API errors are listed in [the error reference](/docs/errors/).
# Screenshot authenticated pages
There is a few methods to screenshot authenticated pages:
1. [If the website is yours or it allows to send a custom HTTP header with the authentication token when rendering the page.](#1-custom-http-header)
2. [If the website is yours, allow to bypass authentication for ScreenshotOne servers.](#2-allow-bypassing-authentication-for-screenshotone-servers)
3. [Using cookies.](#3-using-cookies)
## 1. Custom HTTP header
If the website is yours or it allows to send a custom HTTP header with the authentication token when rendering the page, you can use the following method:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com&headers=Authorization: Bearer <your authentication token>
```
Or:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com&authorization=Bearer <your authentication token>
```
Support the header name is different, e.g. `X-API-Key`, you can use the following syntax:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://example.com&headers=X-API-Key: <your authentication token>
```
## 2. Allow bypassing authentication for ScreenshotOne servers
This method is complicated and requires for you to configure your firewall to [allow the ScreenshotOne servers](/docs/ip-ranges/) to access the website.
## 3. Using Cookies
If the website you are trying to screenshot uses cookies to authenticate users and doesn't block automation or it is yours, you can use cookies with the ScreenshotOne API to render pages behind authentication.
I will use [ScreenshotOne's Dashboard](https://dash.screenshotone.com/) as an example. Suppose, I want screenshot the dashboard page (`https://dash.screenshotone.com/dashboard`):
![ScreenshotOne's Dashboard](./dashboard.png)
If I screenshot it straight away like:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://dash.screenshotone.com/dashboard
```
I will get the following result:
![Unauthenticated](./unauthenticated.jpeg)
It is an authenticated form.
Let's check cookies for the page, after I logged in:
![Cookies](./cookies.png)
Make sure to copy all the cookie parameters, including the `domain`, `path` and other parameters:
```
__Secure-better-auth.session_token=ZFmIsN7BVPU0Fzzd9aJ7lZU4TLSvu2L2.buMSGkHDIxhT%2B7YIl6tS82eGGLAAeRzk7FMp1YiTtK8%3D
domain=dash.screenshotone.com
path=/
HttpOnly
Secure
Lax
```
Then format it as required by the ScreenshotOne API:
```
__Secure-better-auth.session_token=ZFmIsN7BVPU0Fzzd9aJ7lZU4TLSvu2L2.buMSGkHDIxhT%2B7YIl6tS82eGGLAAeRzk7FMp1YiTtK8%3D; domain=dash.screenshotone.com; path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; Lax
```
And then try to screenshot the page again but with the cookies now:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=<your access key>&url=https://dash.screenshotone.com/dashboard&cookies=__Secure-better-auth.session_token=ZFmIsN7BVPU0Fzzd9aJ7lZU4TLSvu2L2.buMSGkHDIxhT%2B7YIl6tS82eGGLAAeRzk7FMp1YiTtK8%3D; domain=dash.screenshotone.com; path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; Lax
```
The result will be as expected:
![Authenticated](./authenticated.jpeg)
One pitfall is that likely you will need to write your own code to sign in to the website and get the cookies.

# Customize websites before screenshotting
ScreenshotOne supports a few options that can help you add any customizations to any website before rendering screenshots of it.
## Hide any element by CSS selectors
If you just need to quickly hide a few elements on the website, just use [the hide_selectors](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#hide_selectors) option and specify as many CSS selectors as you wish.
For example, let's hide the main header on the example.com website with:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://example.com&hide_selectors=h1&access_key=<your API key>
```
Before hiding:
![A customized version of the example.com website](with_header.png)
After hiding:
![A customized version of the example.com website](without_header.png)
You can specify as many selectors as you wish, e.g.:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://example.com&hide_selectors[]=h1&hide_selectors[]=p&access_key=<your API key>
```
## Add custom CSS styles
But often you want to do more than just hide a few elements. Maybe you want to change some colors of the elements, or font size, or whatever. Then you can simply add custom CSS styles with [the styles option](https://screenshotone.com/docs/options/#styles).
Don't forget to encode the code. And often, you must add a `!important` attribute to every property you use.
Let's try it with the example.com website:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://example.com&styles=h1%20%7Bcolor%3A%20red%20%21important%3B%7D&access_key=<your API key>
```
Notice, that the styles parameter is URL-encoded. Let's look at the result:
![A customized version of the example.com website](example_com_with_styles.webp)
## Execute custom JavaScript code
But what if hiding elements and adding styles is not enough? We got you covered! You can any custom JavaScript code you want.
You can check out a more complex example of using scripting for integrating [Google Translate API when screenshotting websites](/docs/guides/how-to-translate-and-render-a-website-as-a-screenshot/).
:::caution
If your script causes navigation and makes the page reload, make sure to specify [the scripts_wait_until option](/docs/options/#scripts_wait_until) if you want to wait or large enough [delay](/docs/options/#delay).
:::
Let's execute an extreme example and just override the page content with:
```javascript
scripts = document.body.innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
```
The URL would look like:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?scripts=document.body.innerHTML="Hello,%20world!"&url=https://example.com/&access_key=<your access key>
```
And the result is:
![A customized version of the example.com website](hello_world_example.webp)
## Click
If you use scripting to only click on some element by selector, there is a popular shortcut for that [the click option](/docs/options/#click).
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?click=.a-some-button-class-selector&url=https://example.com&access_key=<your access key>
```
Just specify any selector of any element and it will be clicked.
# Full-page screenshots
By default, the only thing you need to do is to set the `full_page` parameter to `true`:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=https://example.com&full_page=true&access_key=...
```
The API tuned to balance performance and quality for the full-page screenshots. However, if you need to improve the quality of rendering, for the full-page screenshots, there is a few things you can do:
1. [Try different rendering algorithms.](#different-rendering-algorithms)
2. [Tune scrolling of the page.](#tune-scrolling)
3. [Reduce animations.](#reduce-animations)
4. [Wait more.](#wait-more)
However, improving the quality of rendering might lead to a performance degradation.
## Different rendering algorithms
By default, the API uses the `full_page` uses a simple algorithm to screenshot the full page—it asks the browser to render it and usually that means that the browser just stretches the viewport to render the full-page screenshot. It rarely but leads to rendering issues.
You can try to use a different algorithm instead—by_sections:
```
full_page_algorithm=by_sections
```
It might be better in most cases. Since it will try to scroll the page and render it section by section, and then stitch all the sections into one image.
But while scrolling the page, not every element might triggered due the speed of the scrolling and the delay between the scrolls. Try to tune scrolling.
## Tune scrolling
Try to decrease or increase the size of the scroll step:
```
full_page_scroll_by=500
```
And increase the delay between the scrolls, it might help to render the page correctly
```
full_page_scroll_delay=1500
```
It might help to render the page better and trigger more lazy-loaded elements.
## Reduce animations
Request websites to reduce the number of animations by adding the `reduced_motion` parameter:
```
reduced_motion=true
```
## Wait more
Add from 5 to 10 seconds to wait for the page to load:
```
delay=5
```
## Block ads, trackers, banners and other elements
Request the API to block ads, trackers, banners and other elements by use the following parameters:
```
block_ads=true&block_trackers=true&block_cookie_banners=true&block_chats=true&block_banners_by_heuristics=true
```
## Summary
Combining all the tips above, you might try to get the best results with something like that:
```
https://api.screenshotone.com/take?access_key=...&url=https://example.com&full_page=true&full_page_algorithm=by_sections&full_page_scroll_by=500&full_page_scroll_delay=1500&reduced_motion=true&delay=5&block_ads=true&block_trackers=true&block_cookie_banners=true&block_chats=true&block_banners_by_heuristics=true
```
## Support
Rendering full-page screenshots reliably is a real challenge. And even after a lot of tuning, it might not work for all the pages.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us at [support@screenshotone.com](mailto:support@screenshotone.com).
# Rendering performance
> "You are never done working on performance."
>
> Guillermo Rauch
ScreenshotOne's API is optimized for performance on permanent basis. However, due to a huge set of parameters that can be used to customize the rendering, there are some use cases where the default performance is not optimal.
The goal of this guide is to help you to tune the rendering parameters for your specific use case.
Of course, if you have any questions or need more help or assistance in performance tuning, please, reach out at `support@screenshotone.com`.
## Disable blocking ads and banners
Blocking ads, banners and other content seriously affects the performance of rendering since the API starts to listen for all the requests, waiting for elements to be shown, and many more tricks and heuristics are used to hide this type of content from the rendering.
In case if you render pages that do not contain any ads, banners or the pages belong to you and you can hide that content for the API, make sure to disable blocking ads, banners, and other content:
```
block_ads=false
block_cookie_banners=false
block_banners_by_heuristics=false
block_chats=false
```
Set these parameters explicitly to `false`, otherwise you rely on the default values that are not optimal for your use case and might be even changed in the future.
## Disable or enable tracking scripts
There is a lot of analytics and tracking scripts that might downgrade the performance of rendering. You can disable them by:
```
block_tracking=true
```
**However!** If you know that the websites you render doesn't have tracking scripts, you can disable them by:
```
block_tracking=true
```
If you do not need them, disable blocking tracking scripts:
```
block_tracking=false
```
Because, to block tracking scripts, the API needs to sniff all the requests, analyze them and block.
This is a parameter that you need to play with for use case, and see what works the best.
## Image format and quality
Use either `JPEG` or `WebP` format for images:
```
format=jpeg or format=webp
```
It is faster to generate, the size is usually smaller than other formats, so it is also faster to transfer these.
The limitation of the `WebP` format is that you can't use it for the huge full page screenshots. In general, it is not recommended to use it for the full page screenshots,
or if you do you use it make sure to set `full_page_max_height` and check that the rendering is not broken for your use case.
In many cases, especially if you generate just tiny previews of the websites, you also don't need high quality images. Try to set lower image quality for the images:
```
image_quality=80
```
And see if it satisfies your needs. However, for some formats reducing the quality might degrade performance. It is better to play with it.
## Viewport size and device scale factor
For huge viewport size, screenshot rendering will take more time. But one of the critical parameters is the `device_scale_factor`.
When you set its value to more than `1`, you double the size of the screenshot. If you are screenshots are not planned to be used for the high DPI displays, you can set it to `1` to reduce the size of the screenshot and rendering time.
```
device_scale_factor=1
```
Make sure to check that the quality fits your needs.
It is also changed automatically to higher values if you use the `viewport_device` parameter with a device that automatically increases it:
```
viewport_device=iphone_16
```
`device_scale_factor` will be set to 3. Try to set it explicitly to `1` and see if it works for your use case:
```
viewport_device=iphone_16
device_scale_factor=1
```
## Wait options
Try to play with the `wait_until` option. Start with `load` and see if it works for your case. Set it explicitly:
```
wait_until=load
```
If you anyway plan to render to full page screenshots and use scrolling, you don't need to wait for everything to loaded since
the page anyway will be scrolled to the bottom and likely this will cover and load all the content.
## Full page screenshots
### Try different algorithms
There are two algorithms for the full page screenshots: `by_sections` and `default`.
The default algorithm is the best one for the most of the cases. Try to use it first with disabled `full_page_scroll` and see if it works for your use case.
```
full_page_algorithm=default
```
However, if you need to try to use the `by_sections` algorithm:
```
full_page_algorithm=by_sections
```
It will render the page by sections, and will scroll anyway. It might be better algorithm if you need to trigger lazy loaded.
### Disable full page scrolling
If you do not need full page scrolling, disable it by:
```
full_page_scroll=false
```
It will dramatically reduce the rendering time. However, if your page contains lazy loaded content, it won't be loaded.
### Tune full page scrolling
If you anyway need to scroll pages, try to play with the settings of the scrolling algorithm:
```
full_page_scroll_delay=100
```
If that still allows to render most of the images for your use case, go for it.
## Summary
It is hard to make the API product to satisfies all the use cases and still be performant. But with some tuning, it is achievable.
Please, feel free to reach out at `support@screenshotone.com` if you have any questions or need more help or assistance in performance tuning.
