Notable additions and updates to the Flatfile platform

<Update label="03-07-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Enhanced agent discovery with new search capabilities. Users can now search for agents by either agent slug or agent ID directly from both the agents list view and the agents detail page.

  Optimized performance of the getAgents endpoint through pagination implementation. This significantly improving response times and scalability when working with large collections of agents.
</Update>

<Update label="02-04-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Records with readonly configurations are now handled differently in the
  replaceRecords operation. A new option called excludeReadOnly has been
  introduced to control whether readonly records or fields should be skipped or
  replaced. If excludeReadOnly is set to true, records with a readonly config or
  fields marked as readonly will not be replaced during the replaceRecords
  operation. If excludeReadOnly is false or not provided, readonly records and
  fields will be replaced as before.

  The findAndReplaceRecords method in the WorkbooksService now checks if the field
  being replaced is readonly and throws an error if excludeReadOnly is set to
  true, preventing modification of readonly fields.

  Several new tests have been added to validate the behavior of the replaceRecords
  operation with readonly records and fields, covering scenarios with
  excludeReadOnly set to true and false.

  The SearchRecordsOptions and GetCellValuesOptions interfaces have been updated
  to include the new excludeReadOnly option.

  Example usage:

  ```typescript
  // Replace non-readonly records or fields
  const records = await wb.op.replaceRecords({
    sheetId: wb.contacts.id,
    options: {},
    find: "John",
    replace: "Jonathan",
    field: { key: "firstName" },
    legacyReplace: false,
    actorId: UserId.make(),
  });

  // Skip readonly records or fields
  const records = await wb.op.replaceRecords({
    sheetId: wb.contacts.id,
    options: { excludeReadOnly: true },
    find: "John",
    replace: "Jonathan",
    field: { key: "firstName" },
    legacyReplace: false,
    actorId: UserId.make(),
  });
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="01-31-2025" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Added language support for:

  * Spanish (es-419)
  * Malay (ms)
  * Dutch (nl)
  * Polish (pl)
  * Swedish (sv)
  * Thai (th)
  * Chinese Traditional (zh-hant)
  * Chinese Traditional Hong Kong (zh-hant-HK)
</Update>

<Update label="01-30-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Namespace modification is now supported via API only. Other app fields remain
  editable via the UI but the ability to edit a namespace has been removed
  post-creation.
</Update>

<Update label="01-30-2025" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Fixes bug where long document titles would overlap the page header.
</Update>

<Update label="01-27-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The order of imports from the `@flatfile/api` module has been updated. The `RecordUpdates` and `Success` types are now imported in a different order.

  The implementation of the `clearColumn` method has been refactored. Instead of using the `map` and `filter` array methods, it now uses the `reduce` method to generate the `recordsUpdates` array. The new implementation checks if the field value exists and if the field is not read-only before clearing it. This change likely improves performance and readability.

  The wording of the `info` and `outcome.message` properties in the `transitionJob` call has been updated from "Column was removed" to "Column was cleared". This change provides more accurate messaging about the action performed.

  Additionally, the code now handles read-only fields correctly. If a field is marked as read-only in the `RecordConfig`, its value will not be cleared.

  These changes improve the functionality, performance, and messaging of the `clearColumn` logic without introducing any breaking changes to the external interface.
</Update>

<Update label="01-24-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The unique validation and record/cell validity handling has been improved to:

  * properly escape field keys containing special characters like periods
  * correctly apply the `error` state and appropriate error messages when duplicate values are encountered for fields with a unique constraint
  * handle cases where all initially added records have invalid (duplicate) values for fields with a unique constraint
</Update>

<Update label="01-23-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  When clearing a column in a job operation, a snapshot of the sheet will be taken
  before the column is cleared. This snapshot will be labeled with the specific
  column key that is being cleared, providing a record of the sheet state before
  the column clearing operation. The snapshot is taken by calling a new utility
  function `takeSnapshotForJob`, which handles creating and labeling the snapshot
  based on the job, sheet, and column details. This allows developers to review
  the sheet state prior to the column clearing if needed.
</Update>

<Update label="01-22-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The release adds the ability to mark a space as an app template and filter
  spaces based on whether they are app templates or not.

  This can be used with the new space-configure-from-template plugin to create new
  spaces using an existing space as a template.

  When using Autobuild for a new App, the space generated during Autobuild will
  automatically be tagged as the template for that App.
</Update>

<Update label="01-22-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  We added the ability to sort enum fields by label, value, or ordinal within the enum field config. This will ensure that enums will be displayed in the chosen order in mapping and review table. The default sortBy is label.
</Update>

<Update label="01-22-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The release introduces the ability to filter spaces by the associated app ID
  when retrieving a list of spaces. A new query parameter `appId` has been added
  to the `/v1/spaces` endpoint. Developers can now pass the `appId` query
  parameter to retrieve only the spaces associated with the specified app. For
  example, `?appId=us_app_123` will return only spaces linked to the app with ID
  `us_app_123`. If an invalid or non-existent app ID is provided, an empty list
  will be returned.
</Update>

<Update label="01-17-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  An error is now thrown if attempting to clear a readonly column in a sheet. This
  prevents modifying data in readonly columns.

  Example:

  ```
  const field = {
    key: 'ReadonlyColumn',
    label: 'Readonly Column',
    type: 'string',
    readonly: true
  }
  ```

  Attempting to clear this column will throw an error: 'Column is readonly and
  cannot be cleared'.

  An error is also thrown if attempting to clear any column in a readonly sheet.
  This prevents modifying data in readonly sheets.

  Example:

  ```
  const sheet = {
    config: {
      readonly: true,
      fields: [...]
    }
  }
  ```

  Attempting to clear a column in this sheet will throw an error: 'Sheet is
  readonly. Column cannot be cleared'.

  These changes ensure data integrity by preventing unintended modification of
  readonly data.
</Update>

<Update label="01-13-2025" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The `clearColumnAction` now has a constraint added that checks if the column is enabled before allowing the action to be executed. This ensures that the action can only be performed on columns that are currently enabled, preventing any potential issues or errors that could arise from attempting to clear a disabled column.
</Update>

<Update label="01-06-2025" tags={["spaces"]}>
  The manual entry and file upload button shown when the workbook is empty have
  has their max width updated so they can support more text.
</Update>

<Update label="12-30-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Trailing empty records in CSV files will now be trimmed during file extraction.
  Empty records in-between records with values will continue to be kept.
</Update>

<Update label="12-20-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  * Record order is now maintained when inserting records
  * When using the Flatfile API to add records, the order of those records will
    now be preserved keeping the original sequence as provided
</Update>

<Update label="12-10-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Fixes a bug where AI assist would crash when ‘config’ object or the ‘options’
  array is undefined.
</Update>

<Update label="12-09-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Fixes a bug where an error would be thrown when config options was undefined
  during sheet upsert operations.
</Update>

<Update label="12-06-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  There was a bug causing the name of environment secrets not to update when
  edited. This fixes the bug ensuring environment secret names are updated.
</Update>

<Update label="12-04-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  The `viewMapped` functionality has been updated to include new text strings for
  messaging related to updating a table to only view mapped fields. The messages
  include "Updating the table to only view mapped fields", "Halfway there, hang
  tight...", "Almost done...", "Table update complete. Please audit the data", and
  "An error occurred while updating the workbook. See Event Logs." These strings
  will be displayed to the user during the process of updating a table to show
  only mapped fields, providing status updates and handling potential errors. This
  change enhances the user experience by providing clear communication during this
  operation.
</Update>

<Update label="12-02-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  A bug fix was made to the handling of enum field options when updating a sheet.
  Previously, if the `config.options` property was undefined, an error would
  occur. Now, if `config.options` is undefined, it defaults to an empty array.
  This ensures that the code can safely handle cases where `config.options` is not
  present or is undefined. For example, if a developer was updating a sheet with
  an enum field that did not previously have any options defined, the update can
  now proceed without errors.
</Update>

<Update label="12-02-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Added three keys: `addColumn`, `clearColumn`, and `removeColumn` with their
  respective translations for adding, clearing, and removing columns.

  In the English translation file, the title of the “mapValues” section has been
  updated from “Map values” to “Map Fields”.
</Update>

<Update label="11-13-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Updates to the mapping flow to prevent a user from accidentally navigating
  "back" into a mapping flow after it has already been completed.
</Update>

<Update label="10-28-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Bug Fixes in Edit and Create App Forms**

  We've resolved several issues affecting the Edit and Create App forms:

  * Fixed form validation issues
  * Improved error handling
  * Enhanced user feedback
</Update>

<Update label="10-17-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Updated the AutoBuild flow to allow editing the working space name during the
  build process. The name can now be edited by clicking an icon next to the space
  name, which reveals an input field to enter a new name. The name change is saved
  when the input field loses focus or the Enter key is pressed. Added a badge
  indicating "Dev Mode" when not in the production environment.

  Simplified the loading step by removing the detailed progress indicators and
  showing only a centered loader component.

  Updated the BlueprintTab component to display a bottom border and align the
  blueprint view action icons to the right.
</Update>

<Update label="10-03-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Implemented sheet ordering functionality in the sidebar. Sheets are now
  displayed in the order specified by the `sheetSidebarOrder` setting in the
  workbook. Any sheets not included in the order are appended to the end.
</Update>

<Update label="10-01-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The getDataDiff function has been updated to handle array values correctly when
  comparing proposed changes with existing source (src) and artifact data.

  If the proposed array value is the same as the existing array value in either
  the source or artifacts, it will not be included in the changeset returned by
  getDataDiff.

  The function now uses the lodash isEqual utility to compare array values,
  instead of strict equality (===), to account for differences in order or
  reference of array elements.

  For example, if the proposed tags array is \['jedi', 'sith'], it will not be
  included in the changeset if the existing source tags are \['JEDI', 'SITH'] or if
  the existing artifact tags are \['jedi', 'sith'], because the values are
  considered equal despite differences in capitalization or array order.

  This change ensures that unnecessary changes are not included in the changeset
  when working with array values, reducing noise and improving the accuracy of the
  changeset calculation.
</Update>

<Update label="09-27-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.17`

  Secrets have been updated to introduce new optional fields for filtering.

  A new optional `actorId` field of type `ActorId` has been added to the
  `ListSecrets` request type and `WriteSecret` type for secrets. This allows
  filtering secrets by the associated actor (user, guest, agent, or api key).
</Update>

<Update label="09-25-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.16`

  Added new methods to for managing stored sheet constraints: `getConstraints`,
  `createConstraint`, `getConstraintById`, `updateConstraint`, and
  `deleteConstraint`.
</Update>

<Update label="09-20-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.15`

  With the addition of archived spaces there is now an ability to `unarchiveSpace`
  method and `space:unarchived` event.

  Deprecated use of metadata field at the cell value level, recommending use of
  record level metadata instead.
</Update>

<Update label="09-11-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `spaces-ui`

  Updates to Snapshots resource to track changes to a sheet's schema (i.e. added
  and removed columns). A more robust Snapshot will enable more complex features
  when comparing 2 different snapshots.
</Update>

<Update label="09-10-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.14`

  #### Actions Resource

  Actions are now a first class resource. Developers may now create, retrieve,
  update, and delete actions via the api. New action events ActionCreated,
  ActionUpdated, and ActionDeleted are now being published and an actionId field
  has been added to the Context of events.

  #### Agent Versioning

  Agents versioning has been introduced. You may now retreieve agent versions via
  the api and revert to a previous version via the api and the dashboard.

  #### Token Refresh

  Guests actively using their space will have their token's automatically renewed.

  #### Sheet & Cell Updates

  Support for array values in cell values has also been added.

  #### Job Metadata

  Metadta is now available on the `JobConfig` type, allowing additional data to be
  associated with jobs.
</Update>

<Update label="09-06-2024" tags={["dashboard"]}>
  Session name validation has been introduced to the dashboard, preventing the
  creation of new sessions with the same name.

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/spacename_validation.png)

  Note that sessions created via embedded or the api will not be constrained, this
  is a dashboard only validation.
</Update>

<Update label="08-20-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.13` `spaces-ui`

  New fields 'guide' and 'guardrail' have been added to Actions. These options
  enable providing markdown guidance and warnings to your users.

  ```typescript
  actions: [
    {
      operation: 'submitActionFg',
      mode: 'foreground',
      label: 'Submit For Approval',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Submit this data to a webhook.',
      primary: true,
      guide: {
          content: "### Personalized Guide \n\n Before performing..."
      },
      guardrail: {
          content: "### Warning! \n\n This Submit ..."
      }
    },
    {...}
  ],
  ```

  The markdown content of guide will become accessible to the end user via a
  tooltip on the action element.

  The `guardrail` component will render as a modal warning before the action event
  is triggered. This can be useful for actions that have critical consequences or
  require user acknowledgment before proceeding.

  This can be useful for actions that have critical consequences or require user
  acknowledgment before proceeding.
</Update>

<Update label="08-15-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `spaces-ui`

  The "requireAllValidTotal" option has been added for custom actions in the Sheet
  toolbar. This new option requires all rows in the Sheet to be valid for the
  action to be enabled, regardless of selection. If "requireAllValidTotal" is set
  and there are any validation errors in the entire Sheet, the custom action will
  be disabled with the corresponding tooltip message.

  The existing "requireAllValid" option has been updated to only apply to the
  selected rows, rather than all rows. If "requireAllValid" is set and there are
  validation errors in the selected rows, the custom action will be disabled with
  the corresponding tooltip message.
</Update>

<Update label="08-14-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `spaces-ui`

  Introduces support for handling locked sheets (indicated by the locked icon),
  and improves the handling of import files.
</Update>

<Update label="08-09-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.8`

  A new `reference-list` property type has been added to allow defining an array
  of values referenced from another sheet. Links will be established automatically
  by the matching engine or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar
  columns between datasets.

  The `ReferencePropertyConfig` has been updated to make the `relationship`
  property optional, allowing it to be omitted.
</Update>

<Update label="07-23-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.7`

  New options have been added to the ListWorkbooksRequest to allow filtering
  workbooks by name, namespace, label, and treatment, as well as controlling
  whether to include sheets. For example, you can now pass a `name` parameter to
  filter workbooks by name, or a `treatment` parameter to filter by treatment. The
  `includeSheets` boolean parameter controls whether sheet data is included in the
  response.
</Update>

<Update label="07-17-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.6`

  In AgentConfig type, a new optional property `sourceMap` of type string has been
  added. This allows including a source map for the agent code.
</Update>

<Update label="07-16-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.5`

  A new property `treatments` of type `Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments[]` has been
  added to the `Workbook` and `CreateWorkbookConfig` types. This array allows
  specifying treatments for a workbook, with the currently available treatment
  being `ExtractedFromSource`. This change introduces a new external interface
  that developers using the package should be aware of when creating or updating
  workbooks.

  Example usage:

  ```typescript
  import { Flatfile } from "@flatfile/api";

  const workbookConfig: Flatfile.CreateWorkbookConfig = {
    // ...other properties
    treatments: [Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments.ExtractedFromSource],
  };
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="07-13-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.9.3`

  A new `JobOutcomeTrigger` type has been introduced to specify whether a job
  outcome's effect should be triggered automatically or manually.
</Update>

<Update label="06-18-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Auto-Expanding Cell Input in Editor Component**

  We have enhanced the cell editing experience with an auto-expanding cell input
  that dynamically adjusts to fit the content. This improvement ensures that users
  can view and edit their data without constraints, enhancing the overall editing
  experience.
</Update>

<Update label="06-10-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `spaces-ui`

  Improvements have been made to error handling and user feedback in the file
  import and mapping process. If an error occurs, a popover is displayed to the
  user with the error message, providing clearer feedback on failures during the
  import process.
</Update>

<Update label="06-07-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Select Header Row**

  We've added a new feature that allows users to select the header row in the data
  preview. This feature is particularly useful when the first row of your data
  contains column headers, as it enables you to specify the header row for
  accurate data mapping.
</Update>

<Update label="06-07-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Search for Users**

  You can now search for users in the manager users page. This feature allows you
  to quickly find users by name, email, or role, making it easier to manage your
  user base.

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/search.gif)
</Update>

<Update label="06-06-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Resend User Invite**

  There is now a `/users/:userId/resend-invite` endpoint enabling admins to resend
  an invitation to a user who has not yet accepted it.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Bulk Deletion of Mapping Rules**

  We added a method to delete multiple mapping rules from a program. This new
  `deleteMultipleRules` method simplifies the management of mapping rules by
  allowing bulk deletions. The `DeleteMultipleRulesRequest` type represents the
  request payload, detailing the array of rule IDs to be deleted.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **New Method to Delete Apps**

  We have introduced a new `delete` method that allows you to delete an app.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Enhanced Validation Messages for Records**

  The `ValidationMessage` type has been enhanced with two new optional properties:
  `field` and `path`. The `field` property specifies which field the validation
  message pertains to, while the `path` property, of type `JsonPathString`,
  specifies the JSONPath for the validation message. These enhancements provide
  more context and precision in validation feedback.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Custom Views**

  The `JobOutcomeNext` type now includes a new `view` option, allowing jobs to
  specify a custom view that should be displayed upon completion. To support this,
  we introduced the `JobOutcomeNextView` type, which provides details for the
  custom view, including the sheet ID, hidden columns, and an optional label.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **New Method to Update Sheets**

  We introduced a new `updateSheet` method that allows you to update a sheet's
  name, slug, and metadata. The `SheetUpdateRequest` type represents the update
  request payload, including the name, slug, and metadata of the sheet.
  Additionally, an optional `metadata` property has been added to the `Sheet` and
  `SheetUpdate` types, allowing for the storage of contextual metadata related to
  the sheet.
</Update>

<Update label="05-29-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `spaces-ui`

  A new "Update View" button can now be found in the job outcome modal for jobs
  that modify the visibility of columns in a workbook sheet. This button triggers
  updating the column visibility based on the job outcome.

  There are 2 new capabilities to the next property of Job Outcomes:

  * `view` gives developers the ability to manipulate the Sheet's view on
    completion of a Job - Giving control over things like applying a filter or
    hiding a column
  * `download` gives developers the ability to include file details (such as a
    fileName and URL), which are then used to trigger a download to the user's
    browser on completion of the job
</Update>

<Update label="05-14-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **New Environment Lifecycle Events**

  We've added new domain `Environment` events expanding the scope of domains our
  system recognizes. To leverage these events, you can listen on to the following
  topics: The corresponding event topics are `environment:created`,
  `environment:updated`, and `environment:deleted`.
</Update>

<Update label="05-14-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Enhanced Job Configuration Descriptions**

  We have added descriptions for the DeleteRecordsJobConfig properties to provide
  better clarity: An optional `filter` param allows allows you to provide options
  to filter records, with the default set to none while the `filterField` param
  enables narrowing the valid/error filter results to a specific field, but it
  requires the filter to be set.

  We corrected a typo in the `JobOutcomeNextFiles` type by renaming the file
  property to files to accurately represent an array of file objects.
</Update>

<Update label="05-07-2024" tags={["spaces-ui"]}>
  `spaces-ui`

  #### Saving and Sharing Custom Views

  Users can now apply filters, sorting, and search queries to the Sheet data and
  save those settings as a reusable view. Key changes include:

  * Added a "Views" dropdown in the Sheet toolbar to manage and apply saved views.
  * Added a "Save View" modal that allows users to name and save the current Sheet
    filters/sorting as a view.
  * Users can copy a sharable link with the view settings applied.
  * Saved views are grouped into "My Views" and "All Views" sections.
  * Added backend APIs to create, update, and delete saved views.
  * Added new React hooks and components to support the saved views functionality.
  * Updated translations for the new UI elements related to saved views.
</Update>

<Update label="05-03-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Updated `ListDocumentsResponse`**

  The `data` property now returns an array of `Document` objects instead of the
  previous `DocumentResponse`. This change standardizes the format and improves
  consistency in how document data is handled.
</Update>

<Update label="05-03-2024" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Enhanced Job Configuration**

  We added a new `predecessorIds` property to `JobConfig`. This property allows
  you to specify job dependencies, meaning you can list the IDs of jobs that must
  be completed before the current job can start. This helps in managing and
  sequencing job execution more effectively.

  We added a new feature to handle job outcomes more effectively with a new type
  called `JobOutcomeNext` and its variant files. This includes:

  * `JobOutcomeNextFileObject` Stores individual file information with an ID and
    optional label.
  * `JobOutcomeNextFiles` Handles multiple files, including an array of
    JobOutcomeNextFileObject instances and an optional label.

  We also added a waiting value to the JobStatus enum to indicate when a job is
  paused or pending, improving job processing workflows.
</Update>

<Update label="05-03-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Enhanced Views Request and Response**

  We updated `ListViewsRequest` to include optional `pageSize` and `pageNumber`
  properties, allowing for pagination when retrieving views. We've also added a
  `createdBy` property to `View` and `ViewResponse` to track the creator of each
  view.
</Update>

<Update label="05-01-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Improved event emission logic for workbook creation and update**

  Previously, the `workbook:created` event was emitted even when the workbook was
  only being updated. Now, the logic emits a `workbook:updated` event when
  necessary. Additionally, the `POST /:workbookId/rebuild` endpoint now handles
  eventing properly.
</Update>

<Update label="05-01-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Enhanced Date Parsing Capabilities**

  **Expanded Support for Date Formats**:

  We've broadened our parsing algorithms to accurately recognize and sort a wider
  variety of date formats. This update ensures that when users upload files
  containing date fields, the system robustly handles various international date
  formats and styles.

  **Improved Sorting Accuracy**:

  Dates are now correctly sorted based on their actual chronological order,
  regardless of the format input. This enhancement reduces errors and
  inconsistencies previously encountered with date sorting, ensuring data
  integrity and reliability during file uploads.

  **User Experience Improvement**:

  Users no longer need to modify or standardize date formats in their files before
  uploading. Flatfile automatically interprets and processes diverse date inputs,
  simplifying workflows and reducing manual data preprocessing.
</Update>

<Update label="04-25-2024" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Sorted Workbooks in Mapping**

  Selecting a Sheet in the mapping flow has been updated to apply the same sort
  order consideration as the sidebar. This enhancement ensures consistency in
  workbook sorting for improved user navigation.

  **Enhanced Enum Mapping Logic for Datasets with No Values**

  We’ve addressed a nuanced issue concerning enum mapping and rule application in
  datasets with no values. Previously, the system saved enum mapping rules with a
  logic in place to reuse these rules if every value in a new dataset matched the
  rule. This approach inadvertently included scenarios where datasets had no
  values, considering them as matching all rules due to the absence of values.

  Now, the system filters and applies enum mapping rules based solely on the
  values present in the new dataset. This change ensures that rules are applied
  more accurately, enhancing the system’s logic in handling datasets, especially
  those without any values. This update aims to provide a more reliable and
  logical framework for data processing and rule application.

  **Enhanced Data Mapping Consistency with user created custom fields**

  In our continuous efforts to streamline data import processes, we've implemented
  an improvement targeting the scenario where mapping rules from previous imports
  include destination fields no longer present in the current schema. This
  situation can arise if a custom field was added during a past import session and
  the data being imported is from a completely new sheet, often observed in
  embedded imports. With this update, we ensure a smoother data mapping experience
  by automatically filtering out rules that do not match the current destination
  blueprint, maintaining consistency and accuracy in your data integration
  efforts.

  **Introducing the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping APIs**

  We’re excited to announce the launch of the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping API, a
  significant enhancement to our suite of tools. This new API, encapsulated within
  a user-friendly Python library, is designed to fully harness Flatfile’s mapping
  capabilities. It provides a robust solution for mapping schemas directly within
  your systems, ensuring that your data remains secure in your database. This API
  is ideal for a range of applications, from data pipelines and API integrations
  to complex data conversion workflows.

  The essence of mapping with this API is the transformation of source records
  into target records. This process ranges from straightforward tasks like
  renaming fields (for example, changing “first\_name” to “firstName”) to more
  complex operations such as extracting substrings from fields or concatenating
  multiple fields.

  Our Mapping API and accompanying Python library bring forth new opportunities
  for efficient and precise data mapping, offering customization to meet your
  unique needs and workflow requirements.

  To get started, refer to the
  [README](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-mapping).

  **Improvements for `trackChanges` functionality**

  For users utilizing the `trackChanges` on their Workbooks (disables your actions
  until all commits are complete), we’ve addressed a critical workflow concern.

  Changes in a Reference field result in the creation of a new commit event, which
  was leaving the original commit incomplete. Furthermore, this new commit wasn’t
  triggering an event emission, leading to a chain of incomplete commits.

  We’ve refined the commit completion process: now, commits will be marked as
  complete whenever the user explicitly references a commit in an update request.

  This adjustment is handled out of the box with `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook`
  and ensures a more streamlined and reliable change tracking experience.

  efficiency: each workbook's entry displays a count of contained Sheets,
  alongside a tally of records within each Sheet. Additionally, the validity of
  records is intuitively indicated with color-coded dots—green for valid and red
  for invalid—directly within the Sheet summary. This allows for quick

  **Toolbar blocking jobs Extended to Workbook-Mounted Actions**

  We've extended the functionality of the `toolbarBlocking` job mode beyond
  individual Sheets. Now, when it's applied to Workbook-mounted actions, this mode
  also disables workbook actions (including all of the Sheets actions/toolbars)
  during a job's progress. By its nature, it also still allows interaction with
  the actual data tables.

  **Improved Search Functionality for Null Values in GET Records Endpoint**

  We've refined the search mechanism for empty cells in the GET records endpoint.
  In the past, users would specify `null` in the `searchValue` parameter to locate
  empty cells. However, this method posed ambiguity as it didn't clearly
  distinguish between an exact search for null values and a partial search for the
  string "null".

  Now, to accurately search for cells with null values, you should use empty
  double quotes `""` in the `searchValue` parameter.

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/theming_checkboxes.png)

  We're pleased to announce the expansion of our theming capabilities with new
  customization options for checkboxes:

  **Usage**

  ```jsx
  {
    "theme": {
      "root": {
        "checkboxBorderRadius": "0px",
        "checkboxBorderColor": "red"
      },
      "table": {
        "inputs": {
          "checkbox": {
            "borderColor": "magenta"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  1. Customizable Checkbox Border Radius: Users now have the flexibility to theme
     the border radius of checkboxes, allowing for a more personalized and
     visually cohesive interface.

  2. Theming for Checkbox Border Color: Alongside border radius customization,
     users can also theme the border color of checkboxes, adding another layer of
     visual customization to match your application's aesthetic.

  3. Override Options in Table View: In table contexts, users have the added
     ability to override the default checkbox border color, offering even more
     control over the table's appearance and consistency with your overall design
     theme.

  These enhancements aim to provide greater flexibility and control over the UI,
  enabling users to tailor the look and feel of checkboxes to better align with
  their unique branding and design preferences.

  **Enhanced Theming options for Badges+**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/theming_badges.png)

  We're excited to announce new additions to our theming capabilities, allowing
  for even more customization and a refined user experience.

  **Usage**

  ```jsx
  "theme": {
    "root": {
      "pillBorderRadius": "0px",
      "badgeBorderRadius":"10em"
    },
    "table": {
      "buttons": {
        "pill": {
          "color": "white",
          "backgroundColor": "magenta"
        },
        "iconColor": "magenta"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **What's New:**

  1. Pill and Badge Border Radius Customization: You can now tailor the border
     radius of pills and badges within space theming. This update enables you to
     define and apply a consistent look across all pills and badges in the space
     according to your design preferences.

  2. Toolbar Button Color Theming: We've also introduced the option to customize
     the color of toolbar buttons, giving you more control over the visual style
     of your toolbar.

  3. Inherited and Customizable Toolbar Filters: Toolbar filters will
     automatically inherit the pill border radius settings for a unified
     appearance. However, this can be overridden to suit specific design needs,
     offering both convenience and flexibility.

  These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to providing a versatile
  and user-friendly platform that caters to your unique theming requirements.

  **Revamped UI for Foreground Jobs**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/foreground_facelift.png)

  We've given our foreground jobs a fresh, new look:

  1. Enhanced Job Modal Header: The job modal header now prominently displays job
     information, making it instantly visible and accessible.
  2. Refined Display Details: Information that was previously in the header is now
     elegantly presented as an ultralight subline for improved readability.
  3. Optimized Layout: We've repositioned the display of the percentage and
     remaining time for better clarity and focus.
  4. Improved Time Estimation: For estimated completion time, we've introduced a
     fallback mechanism based on simple linear extrapolation, ensuring more
     accurate and reliable predictions.

  These updates are designed to offer a more intuitive and streamlined user
  experience in tracking and managing foreground jobs.

  **Next Action Links in Job Outcome Dialogs Now Support Linking to internal
  resources**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/next_link.png)

  In addition to the existing ability to link to external URLs and trigger
  downloads, you can now also display links to internal resources upon job
  completion. This enhancement broadens the scope of actions you can perform,
  offering more versatility in directing users to relevant resources or actions
  post-job completion.

  In this code below, we will create a button that says “See all downloads” with
  this path: `/space/us_sp_1234/files?mode=export`

  **Usage**

  ```jsx listener
  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: `The file has been created`,
      acknowledge: true,
      //Reference: https://platform.flatfile.com/s/space/{$id}/{path}?{$query}
      next: {
        type: "id",
        id: "dev_sp_1234",
        path: "files",
        query: "mode=export",
        label: "See all downloads",
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  **Next Action Links in Job Outcome Dialogs Now Support Retrying**

  You can now also display links to retry a job upon job completion or failure.
  This enhancement broadens the scope of actions you can perform, offering more
  versatility in directing users to relevant resources or actions post-job
  completion.

  **Usage**

  ```jsx listener
  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: `The file has been created`,
      acknowledge: true,
      next: {
        type: "retry",

  **Enhanced Theming options for Filters**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/theming_chips.png)

  We've expanded the theming capabilities for filters, providing a more
  customizable and visually appealing interface:

  **Usage**

  ```jsx
  "theme": {
      "table": {
        "filters": {
          "outerBorder": "2px red solid",
          "innerBorderRadius": "0px",
          "outerBorderRadius": "0px"
        }
    }
  }
  ```

  1. New Styling Features for Filters: We've introduced the option to customize
     filters with borders and border radius as part of the table theme.

  2. Flexible Border Radius Design: To accommodate the varying sizes of elements
     and the potential difference in calculated border radius, we now use both
     inner and outer border radius settings. This enhancement not only ensures a
     cohesive look but also adds an extra layer of styling flexibility to the
     filters.

  These improvements are designed to offer more control over the aesthetics of
  filters, enabling a seamless and integrated visual experience.

<Update label="11-28-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Introducing New Endpoint for Workbook Commit Retrieval**

  We're excited to announce the addition of the new GET
  `/workbooks/{workbookId}/commits` endpoint. This improvement streamlines the
  process of retrieving all commits associated with a specific workbook, offering
  a more efficient way to determine the completion status of all processing
  activities on that workbook.

  While this enhancement primarily benefits the Flatfile UI, the endpoint is fully
  exposed, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to optimize commit
  retrieval and processing status checks in their own applications.

  **Improved Handling of Long-Running Jobs with New Timeout Feature**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/job_failure.png)

  To enhance clarity and efficiency in job processing, we’ve implemented an update
  for managing long-running jobs. Previously, jobs that weren’t acknowledged
  within 5 minutes would silently fail due to a timeout by the agent, leading to
  confusion as these jobs never reached completion (They were left in an executing
  state).

  To address this, we’ve now added a routine check that occurs every 5 minutes.
  This check will automatically fail jobs that are still executing but haven’t
  been
  [acknowledged](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/jobs/acknowledge-a-job)
  (ack’d) within this timeframe. This update ensures better transparency and
  control in the job execution process, reducing confusion and streamlining
  operations.
</Update>

<Update label="11-20-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **You can now disable Actions when there are invalid records**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)

  Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all rows were valid,
  essential for preventing unintended data egress.

  Now, developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from
  initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records.

  ```jsx
  actions: [{
    ...
    constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }]
    ...
  }]
  ```

  Add a `constraints` parameter in your Action that includes `type: hasAllValid,`
  to disable actions when there are invalid records.

</Update>

<Update label="11-20-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  We made an enhancement to bulk cell pasting. Previously, locking the cell
  occurred prematurely, causing values to flash after pasting. Now, locking is
  effectively executed later, resulting in a smoother and more stable pasting
  experience.
</Update>

<Update label="11-20-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Space ID Search is now available in the Spaces Table**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/search_spaces.gif)

  We've added a new feature that allows you to search for spaces using their Space
  ID in the Spaces table. This enhancement simplifies the process of locating
  specific spaces quickly and efficiently.
</Update>

<Update label="11-17-2023" tags={["files"]}>
  **Enhanced Weighting Mechanism for User History in Enum Mapping**

  We assign an 80% value to other users' history compared to the current user's
  history. Previously, this was only applied to field mapping, Now, this approach
  has been extended to enum mapping as well.

  This update addresses an issue where conflicting histories between two users
  could result in one user being unable to edit due to the other's history taking
  precedence.

  With this enhancement, the system now more effectively balances historical
  inputs from different users, ensuring smoother and more equitable enum mapping
  automation.

  *It's the little things*: Bulk delete in Spaces is now available\*\*\*

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/bulk_delete_sm.gif)

  We’ve added a new feature that allows for the selection and bulk deletion of
  Spaces from your list. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for customers
  managing numerous Spaces, as it eliminates the need to delete each Space
  individually, streamlining the process and saving time. Enjoy!
</Update>

<Update label="11-17-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **New: Column Visibility Control with Local Storage Memory**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/column_hiding.gif)

  We've introduced a new feature that allows for selective hiding or showing of
  columns, enabling users to customize their view for more focused work.
  Additionally, your column visibility preferences will now be automatically saved
  to local storage, ensuring that your personalized settings are remembered for
  future sessions. This update aims to enhance user efficiency by allowing you to
  tailor the interface to your specific needs and workflow.
</Update>

<Update label="11-17-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Guests can now be named in a Spaces URL**

  Previously, accessing Flatfile either directly through a URL or via an iframe
  with an `accessToken` would categorize all user activities under an anonymous
  guest. Now, if you know the `guestId`, interactions in Flatfile can be tied back
  to that person.

  This is made possible with a new endpoint, **/guests/:guestId/token**, which
  generates an accessToken, and can be used to load the Flatfile space at
  **[http://platform.flatfile.com/space/:spaceId?token=:accessToken](http://platform.flatfile.com/space/:spaceId?token=:accessToken)**.

  With this method, Guests are now accurately named and identifiable, enhancing
  user recognition and auditing.

</Update>

<Update label="11-17-2023" tags={["files"]}>
  **Speed Optimization for Large Enum Lists**

  When either the source (file) or destination (Blueprint) list contains more than
  100 enums, our mapping AI will now utilize a simplified algorithm. This change
  addresses scenarios where customers have extensive enum lists, such as 5,000
  different Shopify products, which previously slowed down our assignment
  algorithm. With this update, the execution speed for such extensive lists will
  be faster, ensuring a more efficient and responsive experience for clients with
  large datasets.
</Update>

<Update label="11-17-2023" tags={["files"]}>
  **Fixed File Extraction for Workbook-Only Guests**

  We’ve fixed an issue where guests with
  [workbook-only access](../developer-tools/security/roles-and-permissions#workbook-grant)
  could upload files but couldn’t extract them due to access restrictions. Guests
  can now upload and extract files smoothly in workbooks they have access to.

  **Hide the info Tooltip**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/infotooltip.png)

  Within each Space, we've implemented an informative tooltip providing essential
  details about the Space. This tooltip serves as valuable support for addressing
  customer inquiries and issues. However, we understand that there are scenarios
  where you may prefer to hide this information from your customers.

  To accommodate your preferences, we've introduced the option to hide this Space
  tooltip. To make this adjustment, you can utilize the "Update Environment" patch
  available in our
  [API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/environments/update-an-environment).

  ```jsx
  metadata: {
    showSpaceInfo: false;
  }

</Update>

<Update label="11-13-2023" tags={["core"]}>
  In this update, we've implemented a crucial enhancement by unifying the casing
  in our API. We've resolved issues where certain properties were inconsistently
  cased, which had previously hindered their proper setting and retrieval.

  With this unification, you can now seamlessly interact with our API, ensuring a
  smoother and more reliable experience.
</Update>

<Update label="11-13-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Previously, if an existing value was present in the enum field, you couldn't
  select a different value from the dropdown. Additionally, when a dropdown field
  was empty, you were unable to use the dropdown to select a valid option, and
  typing out an option wasn't possible either. Both of these limitations have now
  been resolved.
</Update>

<Update label="11-07-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Control your mapping accuracy**

  We're excited to announce a new parameter within Sheet configuration, aptly
  named `mappingConfidenceThreshold`. This parameter empowers you to fine-tune
  your experience when working with automatically suggested fields during mapping
  jobs.

  With `mappingConfidenceThreshold`, you have the flexibility to configure the
  minimum required confidence level. Think of it as a precision control, offering
  you the choice between conservative (exact match) or liberal (fuzzy matching)
  settings.

  **How it works**

  Set the value greater than 0 and up to a maximum of 1, for a more precise
  control over the mapping process:

  ```jsx workbook.js
    sheets: [
      mappingConfidenceThreshold: .6,
      {...}
    ]
  ```

  **More Precise Filtering is now Available**

  Now, FFQL queries made via filter: in the the search bar can be seamlessly
  combined with other filters. Whether you prefer using tabbed filters like
  “valid” and “error,” or you rely on the “Filter By Value” menu, you can now
  harness the power of FFQL alongside these filters.

  With this update, you’ll experience precise narrowing of row results every time
  you apply FFQL queries in conjunction with other filters. No more guesswork—your
  filtered results will be spot on, making it easier than ever to find the
  information you need with pinpoint accuracy.
</Update>

  **Theming Column Headers**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/fontinheader.png)

  You can now control the font of the headers in a table using the
  `column.header.fontFamily` property.

  **Enhanced Cell Copying with Multi-line Preservation**

  We've improved the functionality for copying cells from external spreadsheets
  into our system. Now, when you copy cells containing more than one line, these
  new lines are preserved in the cell value upon pasting.

  While these additional lines may not be visually apparent in the table, you can
  verify their presence by inspecting the data through the API, or by copying and
  pasting the cell content into another application.

  This update ensures better data integrity and consistency when transferring
  content with complex formatting.

<Update label="10-30-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Removed Character Limit on Mappings, Jobs, and Enum Mappings**

  We have lifted the previous 255-character limit for mappings, jobs, and enum
  mappings. This update allows for greater flexibility and more detailed entries
  in these areas.
</Update>

<Update label="10-30-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **New API Feature to Restore Archived Spaces**

  API users now have the capability to restore an archived space. This can be done
  by setting the `archivedAt` property of the space to null via the
  `PATCH /spaces/:spaceId` endpoint.
</Update>

<Update label="10-30-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Improved Cascade Deletion for Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets**

  We've enhanced the deletion process for Spaces. In the past, deleting a Space
  did not automatically cascade to its Workbooks and Sheets. Now, with the latest
  update, soft deleting a Space will also soft delete its associated Workbooks and
  Sheets.

  Furthermore, we've refined the `GET /workbooks` query. It now filters out
  workbooks linked to previously deleted Spaces, ensuring that only relevant and
  active workbooks are displayed. This update is helpful for Spaces deleted before
  this improvement was implemented.
</Update>

<Update label="10-30-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  **Enhanced Display of Enum Options in Turntable**

  We've addressed an issue in the table where enum options without a label were
  incorrectly displaying as 'undefined'. With the latest update, in cases where an
  enum option lacks a label, the table will now default to showing the option's
  value instead.

  This ensures a more accurate and user-friendly display of data.

  **Disable Actions while Hooks are Running**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/trackChanges.gif)

  Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all hooks had
  finished running, essential for ensuring data transformation completion and
  preventing unintended data egress. As a workaround, they resorted to creating
  placeholder fields that defaulted to invalid states. When a hook completed
  processing for a record, it marked the field as valid, allowing submission only
  when there were no errors in this field.

  Now, we're thrilled to introduce a solution to simplify this process—an all-new
  event: `commit:completed`. This event signals the end of all processing tasks.

  ```jsx
  settings: [{ trackChanges: true }];
  ```

  Add a `settings` parameter in your sheet that includes `trackChanges: true,` to
  disable actions on both Sheets and Workbooks until any pending commits have been
  completed.

  when editing. Note: if you paste without selecting any cells, the operation will
  automatically apply to the bulk-selected rows.
</Update>

<Update label="10-16-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  In the past, when your Space took more than 10 seconds to build, an "empty space

  **New: Embed Sheets inside Documents**

  Now, by simply incorporating the `embed` HTML entity into your markdown body and
  providing the sheet ID, workbook ID, and name, you can effortlessly embed Sheets
  into Documents. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose whether the
  embedded Sheet starts in an expanded or collapsed state when the document is
  loaded.

  ```html
  <embed
    type="embedded-sheet"
    name="Contacts"
    defaultExpanded="true"

  Documents, which are standalone webpages within your Spaces, can now host a
  variety of actions, just like Workbooks, Sheets, and Files.

  Document-Mounted Actions have their own configuration within a Document object.
  The executable code within an Action is compiled into a Job entity, offering the
  flexibility to run asynchronously or immediately. This empowers you to create
  more interactive and dynamic Documents, enhancing the overall user experience
  within your Flatfile Spaces.

  ```jsx workbook.js
  //your document can now have an action that looks like this
  actions: [
    {
      operation: 'sendAction',

  **The API now supports two new actions: `sheets.lock` and `sheets.unlock`.**

  With the introduction of these API actions, you gain the ability to manage sheet
  locking within your application. The `sheets.lock` action allows you to lock a
  sheet, preventing any further modifications to its content. Conversely, the
  `sheets.unlock` action enables you to release the lock and restore full editing
  capabilities to the sheet.

  These new API actions provide greater control and flexibility when it comes to
  managing sheet access and data integrity.

  **New: Full-screen Documents!**

  Documents have gained a new capability, allowing them to seamlessly transition
  into full-screen takeovers, thus removing their presence from the sidebar.

  **How it works:**

  To enable this functionality, we've introduced a new property on Documents:
  `treatments`. This property allows users to define specific descriptors for each
  Document. When a Document is assigned the "ephemeral" treatment, it will
  transform into a full-screen overlay, visible exclusively within the Spaces
  dashboard, while being discreetly tucked away from the Spaces sidebar.

  This enhancement enhances user creativity and provides the freedom to tailor
  document-driven interactions precisely to their needs.

  ```ts

<Update label="10-09-2023" tags={["files"]}>
  Previously, when uploading a file, actions could only be added to it after the
  file was uploaded (by calling a file update via a listener). Now, with our
  latest update, you can now include actions during file upload allowing actions
  to be applied to the file immediately upon creation.

  See the
  [API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/files/upload-a-file).
</Update>

<Update label="10-09-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  The find/replace operation is now able to handle large datasets. Now, records
  are batched into groups of 10,000 rows, and a unique versionId is assigned to
  each batch. Additionally, the workbook service will emit events for each batch
  processed.

  This improvement is particularly beneficial for @flatfile/plugin-record-hook,
  which can now retrieve and respond to all records in a single find/replace
  operation, thanks to the 10,000-row batching.
</Update>

<Update label="10-09-2023" tags={["core"]}>
  When adding a secret to a space via the API, we have expanded the flexibility of
  secret names. While the API allows spaces within secret names, the UI previously
  restricted them by filtering spaces in the regex validation logic for Secret
  Names. With this update, space characters are now considered valid and accepted
  characters in secret names, aligning the behavior between the API and the UI.

  **Now Available: Accept Dynamic Inputs on Actions**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/action_inputs.png)

  Now, when initiating an action, you have the option to gather additional
  information from end users to facilitate the successful completion of the
  intended task.

  **Here’s how it works:**

  Suppose you want to allow users to specify the name of the file they intend to
  export. In such cases, you can configure input fields for your action. When an
  end user triggers this action, a secondary dialog will appear, prompting them to
  provide the necessary information.

  **The available input types include:**

  * `string`: For capturing text-based information.
  * `textarea`: Ideal for longer text entries or descriptions.
  * `number`: To collect numeric data.
  * `boolean`: For simple yes/no or true/false responses.
  * `enum`: Enables users to select from a predefined list of options.

  **Two easy ways to get started:**

  * Learn about all the parameters available on `inputForm` for Actions
    [here](../orchestration/actions#inputform).
  * Or follow this copy/paste [Guide](../guides/actions#actions-with-input-forms)
    to quickly see it in action in your code.

  **Exciting Update: Additional Fields**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/addl_fields.png)

  With additional fields, end users can seamlessly map to fields that don’t exist
  by simply adding a new property to any of your new or pre-existing Blueprint(s).

  Here’s how it works:

  * When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to
    accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its
    configuration.
  * These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by
    end users during the file import process.
  * Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a
    treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what
    extends the Blueprint.
  * What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically
    set to match the header name from the file being mapped. This simplifies the
    process.

  Previously, when using the find and replace feature, only the initial batch of
  records had data hooks run again. Now, the find/replace operation efficiently
  groups records into batches of 10,000 rows, assigning a unique versionId to each
  batch. This improvement empowers record-hooks to process all records seamlessly
  within a single find/replace operation.
</Update>

<Update label="10-02-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Now, you can include a free-form JSON object as `metadata` on your Workbook,

</Update>

<Update label="10-02-2023" tags={["spaces"]}>
  Previously, when adding a secret to a space through the API, we supported spaces
  in secret names. However, the UI had regex logic that filtered out spaces when
  validating secret names.

  In this update, we've harmonized the process by accepting space characters as
  valid characters for secret names in both the API and the UI. Your secret names
  can now include spaces without any issues.
</Update>

<Update label="10-02-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  We've resolved an issue where long messages would overflow the cell in

</Update>

<Update label="09-22-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  We've revamped the way partial replaces work, enhancing your data editing
  experience for maximum smoothness and intuitiveness. In the past, when you
  attempted to replace specific characters with an empty string (""), it
  occasionally resulted in the cell value becoming null, which wasn't quite what
  you had in mind.

  For instance, if you needed to eliminate dashes from UUID fields, you'd
  naturally want "abc-123" to transform into "abc123" rather than mysteriously
  turning null.

  We value your feedback. Now, you can confidently perform partial replacements
  without the hassle of unexpected null values.
</Update>

<Update label="09-22-2023" tags={["files"]}>
  We've made improvements behind the scenes to ensure that your data gets mapped
  with more precision. Previously, some data could be missed during mapping, but

  **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

  **`acknowledge: false`**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

  By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the
  top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This
  approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the
  end user.

  **`acknowledge: true`**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)

  When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen
  modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by
  clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

  **Usage**

  ```jsx
  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      acknowlege: true,
      message: "Text here.",
    },
  });

  **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)

  Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

  **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional
  flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or
  Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and
  ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

  ```jsx
  constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }],
  ```

  **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience,
  we've introduced the `hasSelection` flag. When added as a constraint, this flag
  disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring
  Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.

  ```jsx
  constraints: [ { type: 'hasSelection' }],
  ```

  [Learn more](../orchestration/actions#optional-parameters).
</Update>

<Update label="09-01-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  **Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**

  **Enhanced Number Field Queries:**

  When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the
  query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow"
  value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've
  resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g.,
  ".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.

  **Advanced Date Field Handling:**

  For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On
  the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into
  dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing
  requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`,
  and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date
  values.

  **Fix for Invalid Number Input:**

  We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the
  previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is
  properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.

  These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and
  a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

  and list items whenever the associated Action is enabled. This enhancement
  provides users with clear and context-aware explanations for enabled Actions,
  contributing to an improved overall user experience.
</Update>

<Update label="09-01-2023" tags={["dataxp"]}>
  Fixed a cosmetic issue with scrolling through Workbooks. The problem stemmed

  **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

  With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import
  experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete,
  these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate
  handling of your data.

  The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a
  half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

  In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to
  use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

  While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost
  performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system.
  Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now
  history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our
  database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

  In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.

Notable additions and updates to Flatfile core libraries

<Update label="03-04-2025" tags={["cli"]}>
  As of version 3.9.0, the Flatfile CLI now includes TypeScript types (if available) and package.json in the source map when deploying an agent. This enhancement improves debugging capabilities and provides better type information in the deployed code, making it easier to troubleshoot issues in production environments.
</Update>

<Update label="09-18-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.12.4`

  Fixes a bug when relaunching a re-used space. Resolves an issue causing the
  "Maximum update depth exceeded" React error when multiple Portals are used
  within the same FlatfileProvider (this is not supported). Introduces changes to
  the FlatfileContext and FlatfileProvider components to handle the onClose
  callback, using a mutable ref instead of state. Refactors the resetSpace
  function and introduces changes to handle the resetOnClose config option when
  re-using a space.
</Update>

<Update label="09-17-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.12.3`

  The release notes include a fix for a bug with the Workbook onSubmit
  functionality. Specifically, it addresses an issue where the onSubmit action was
  not being correctly added or updated in the workbook actions list. The fix
  ensures that the onSubmit action is properly added or updated when the onSubmit
  prop is provided, and that duplicates are not created if the action already
  exists. This change is relevant for developers using the Workbook component and
  expecting the onSubmit callback to be triggered when the workbook is submitted.
</Update>

<Update label="09-13-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.4.2`

  The JavaScript Portal style sheet is now attached only once, instead of every
  time the Portal is opened. This should improve performance and avoid redundant
  style sheet insertions.

  A new option has been added to allow specifying submit complete options, giving
  more control over the behavior when submitting a job. Developers can now set the
  'acknowledge' and 'message' properties when completing a job submission.

  This would result in the job being completed with 'acknowledge' set to false and
  'message' set to 'Custom complete message'.
</Update>

<Update label="08-28-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.12.7`

  Added option `submitSettings.startingJobMessage` to configure the initial
  message displayed in the job progress modal.

  `@flatfile/react@7.12.2`

  The release includes a new `removeSheet` method to allow removing a specific
  sheet from the workbook by its sheet slug.
</Update>

<Update label="08-09-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.12.1`

  This release updates the @flatfile/react package to version 7.12.1. The update
  fixes a bug where the space was not completely reset upon closing the Flatfile
  Portal. Specifically, the changes ensure that when the Flatfile Portal is
  closed, the internal session space is reset, preventing any state from
  persisting between sessions.
</Update>

<Update label="08-09-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.4.1`

  The startFlatfile function has been exported from the package, allowing
  developers to invoke it directly. Additionally, the FlatfileClient type has been
  exported from the @flatfile/api package, providing developers with access to
  this type when using the @flatfile/javascript package.
</Update>

<Update label="08-08-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.12.0`

  This release includes the following changes:

  A new `onClose` event handler has been added to the `useFlatfile` hook, allowing
  developers to specify a callback function that is called when the Flatfile modal
  is closed.

  The missing stylesheet for the legacy `useSpace` and `usePortal` flows has been
  restored, ensuring proper styling for these deprecated hooks.

  By default, the Flatfile modal now fills the entire screen. Developers may need
  to adjust any style overrides to accommodate this change.

  Additionally, a bug that prevented server-side configuration of Spaces has been
  fixed.
</Update>

<Update label="07-17-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.11.0`

  The CSS variable `--ff-color-text` has been renamed to `--ff-text-color` to be
  consistent with other variable names. This change affects the text color used
  throughout the Flatfile React components.
</Update>

<Update label="07-16-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.4.0`

  This exciting release adds internationalization support to the Flatfile
  JavaScript SDK. The SDK now detects the user's browser language or allows
  specifying an override language. Translation strings are provided for the
  confirmation modal, error modal, and other UI elements. The SDK also includes
  functionality to handle missing translation keys and log them to the console.

  Additionally, this release updates the modal logic to use functional components
  and make the text strings dynamic based on the provided translations or
  defaults.

  A new util function `initializeIFrameConfirmationModal` is introduced to handle
  mounting the confirmation modal and its associated behaviors onto the iFrame
  wrapper element. This function takes callbacks for the modal's button click
  actions (exit or stay) and text string providers for the modal's title, message,
  and button labels.
</Update>

<Update label="07-08-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.10.0`

  The `FlatfileProvider` component now accepts a new `styleSheetOptions` prop
  which allows setting the nonce value and position of the injected stylesheet.
  This gives more control over how the styles are applied.

  The package now contains utility functions `attachStyleSheet` and `styleInject`
  to dynamically inject the stylesheet into the DOM at runtime. This replaces the
  previous import of the stylesheet directly.
</Update>

<Update label="06-28-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.9`

  The createlistener function now takes an additional `onClose` parameter. This
  function is used to handle the closing of the Flatfile space, and it removes the
  event listener and cleans up the DOM elements associated with the Flatfile
  space. The `initializeIFrameConfirmationModal` function has also been updated to
  use the new `closeSpaceNow` function, which simplifies the process of closing
  the Flatfile space.
</Update>

<Update label="06-25-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.8`

  A bug fix for issues with the `closeSpace.onClose()` function. This function is
  called when the Flatfile space is closed, and the bug fix ensures that it works
  correctly.

  An improvement to the closing behavior of the Flatfile space. Instead of
  removing the iframe element immediately, a new `closeSpaceNow` function is
  introduced, which handles removing the necessary elements and event listeners in
  a more organized manner.

  There is also an update to the way the confirmation modal is displayed when
  closing the Flatfile space. Instead of using a separate event listener, the
  closing logic is now handled within the existing `closeFlatfileSpace` function,
  which listens for the `job:outcome-acknowledged` event and triggers the closing
  process accordingly.
</Update>

<Update label="06-16-2024" tags={["core"]}>
  `flatfile@3.7.0`

  The latest release of the flatfile package includes improvements for handling
  file uploads and inferring event topics from arrays. Listeners using an array
  syntax `listener.on(['commit:created', 'layer:created'], (event) => {}` will now
  correctly infer the event topics.

  This release also includes a fix for handling file uploads with updated event
  `flatfile.upload`
</Update>

<Update label="05-24-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.9.9`

  This release includes a fix to address instances where the iframe wasn't ready
  when the `portal:initialize` call was posted. The fix ensures that the
  `portal:initialize` message is sent to the iframe only after it has finished
  loading. This resolves an issue where the initialization process could sometimes
  fail due to the iframe not being ready. Developers using the `@flatfile/react`
  package will benefit from a more reliable initialization process for the
  embedded Flatfile experience.

  The new `useIsIFrameLoaded` hook listens for the `load` event on the iframe and
  updates a state variable accordingly. The `portal:initialize` message is then
  sent only when the iframe has finished loading, ensuring a reliable
  initialization process.
</Update>

<Update label="05-22-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.7`

  This release adds the ability to set the default page when preloading the
  Flatfile Portal embed. Use `updateDefaultPageInSpace` and `findDefaultPage` to
  specify which workbook, sheet, or document page should display initially.
</Update>

<Update label="05-21-2024" tags={["core"]}>
  `@flatfile/listener@1.0.5`

  The `unmount()` method has been added, allowing developers to cleanly disconnect
  the event listener from the event driver. The `EventDriver` class now includes
  `unmountEventHandler()` to remove attached event handlers, providing more
  control over event listeners.
</Update>

<Update label="05-01-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.4`, `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.6`,
  `@flatfile/listener@1.0.4`, `@flatfile/react@7.9.3`

  The `closeSpace.operation` and `closeSpace.onClose` properties are now optional,
  offering more flexibility. The `@flatfile/embedded-utils` dependency is updated
  to version 1.2.1, simplifying event listener setup with `handlePostMessage`.

  `@flatfile/listener` now has optimized build tooling and updated dependencies,
  improving compatibility and performance.
</Update>

<Update label="04-27-2024" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.3`, `@flatfile/react@7.9.2`

  This release enables clipboard read and write functionality within the embedded
  Flatfile iframe component. Also, `@flatfile/embedded-utils` is updated to

<Update label="09-29-2023" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@0.1.17` `@flatfile/react@7.2.24`

  In this version, we've made two important updates:

  **Auto-Added Labels for Embedded Spaces:** Embedded spaces now come with
  auto-generated labels (that will be displayed in your Spaces Dashboard) for
  easier navigation and organization.

  **Listener loading Reordered**: The listener is now created before the Workbook,
  allowing you to listen for workbook creation events within your listener for
  more streamlined and effective integration in client-side listeners.
</Update>

<Update label="09-20-2023" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@0.1.13`

  You can now use `@flatfile/api` inside a client-side listener without needing a
  secret key. The listener will instead use the `accessToken` created from your
  `publishableKey`.
</Update>

<Update label="09-20-2023" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/javascript@0.1.11` `@flatfile/react@7.2.21`

  In this version, we've made two important updates:

  1. We've changed the default setting for `sidebarConfig` to hide the sidebar,
     providing a cleaner and more focused workspace.
  2. Now, when no `workbook` is set, `autoConfigure` is automatically turned on
     for Space creation. This enables you to listen for the `space:configure` job
     in a server side listener.
</Update>

<Update label="09-20-2023" tags={["core_plugin"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.2`

  In this update, we've resolved a pesky bug that caused the message generated by
  `recordHook` to be overwritten when `bulkRecordHook` was also in use.

  Our solution? We've introduced caching, ensuring that both messages can coexist
  harmoniously.
</Update>

<Update label="09-12-2023" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.2.20` `@flatfile/javascript@0.1.8`

  @flatfile/react\@7.2.20 & @flatfile/javascript\@0.1.8

  This version update introduces proper class names on the Error container so you
  can more easily control the look and feel of this component.

  See all classes that can be overridden in CSS in the
  [Reference](/apps/embedding/reference/advanced#iframe-styles).
</Update>

<Update label="08-30-2023" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.2.18`

  This version introduces the following notable updates:

  * **Enhanced Close Dialog**: Class names have been incorporated for all elements
    within the close dialog, which becomes visible when closing the embedded
    Flatfile component. This improvement gives you more control on styling.

  * **Utilization of Shared Utilities**: The integration now utilizes the shared
    `@flatfile/embedded-utils` module. This change lays the groundwork for
    consistent properties to be shared across all Flatfile wrapper SDKs, promoting
    standardization and ease of maintenance.

  * **Dependency Refinement**: The dependencies on `vite` and
    `@flatfile/configure` have been removed. This streamlines the codebase and
    reduces unnecessary dependencies, contributing to a more efficient and
    lightweight integration.
</Update>

<Update label="08-24-2023" tags={["wrappers"]}>
  `@flatfile/react@7.2.17`

  An improvement was made to add the `userInfo` param on `metadata` in a more
  comprehensible way.
</Update>

<Update label="08-20-2023" tags={["core"]}>
  `@flatfile/api@1.5.21`

  The response type for the `getRecordsAsCSV` endpoint was incorrectly typed as a
  string instead of a file. This fixes downloading a sheet as a CSV via SDk.
</Update>

<Update label="08-20-2023" tags={["core"]}>
  `@flatfile/listener@0.3.15`

  This version has four great updates:

  * Previously, you had to fake-out TypeScript because the event time was not
    exposed (it was a private class variable) for FlatfileEvents. We have now
    added `createdAt` to the FlatfileEvent.
  * Axios responses 200-399 now no longer throw Errors.
  * Created a secrets cache based on `spaceId`.
  * Previously, if your listener fetched secrets for multiple environments, those
    maps would entirely override each other.
  * If your listener fetched `spaceId` overrides first, and then environment --
    you would get the space id overrides.
  * We now make sure that the fetch URL in the listener is formatted properly
    whether or not the user puts a trailing slash in the environment variable.

  * `callback`: The callback parameter, which receives three arguments—event,
    workbookIds, and a tick function—empowers you with the ability to update the
    Job’s progress. Note: This callback function is invoked once the Space and
    Workbooks are fully configured.

  With the `@flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema`, you can simplify the schema
  conversion process—all in one powerful package.

<Update label="11-09-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-json-extractor@0.1.1`

  The JSON extractor now intelligently flattens nested objects, combining their
  field keys into a single, structured format until it reaches a primitive type,
  making data extraction more comprehensive and user-friendly.
</Update>

<Update label="11-03-2023" tags={["core_plugin"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.11`

  In a recent update, we introduced a comparison mechanism to track changes
  between original and modified values, ensuring that records were only updated
  when both value and messages had changed. However, this approach unintentionally
  excluded updates to metadata when no changes were detected in value or messages.

  In this version, we've refined the process by comparing the entire original
  record object with the modified record object. This ensures that no updates,
  including metadata changes, are left unaccounted for, regardless of whether
  there were changes in the value or message fields. Your records are now more
  comprehensively managed and updated.
</Update>

<Update label="11-02-2023" tags={["core_plugin"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.10`

  Previously, there was an issue with completing commits while using the
  `@flatfile/api` client-side, which led to the error message "Cannot read
  properties of undefined (reading 'get')." To address this problem, we've made a
  swift and effective transition to using fetch. Soon, we plan a more
  comprehensive solution.
</Update>

<Update label="11-01-2023" tags={["core_plugin"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.9`

  * Previously, an issue arose when attempting to complete a commit with the
    `trackChanges` flag (a Workbook setting to disable actions on Sheet and
    Workbook when there is a commit that has not been completed) disabled on the
    Workbook. This issue has been resolved, and commits are now exclusively
    triggered when the `trackChanges` feature is enabled for the Workbook.

  * Additionally, we've implemented an advanced deep comparison method between the
    original record and the potentially modified record. This enhancement
    guarantees that only essential patches for updated records are transmitted,
    resulting in a notably more efficient and precise data update process.
</Update>

<Update label="10-19-2023" tags={["automations"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook@0.0.8`

  When exporting a workbook, a job completion message is now available with an
  added feature. You can now include a "Next" URL within the job completion
  message, providing a seamless transition to the next step in your workflow.
</Update>

<Update label="10-18-2023" tags={["automations"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook@0.0.7`

  In this update, we've made several valuable improvements to enhance your
  experience:

  **Export Record ID Option**: You can now utilize an optional flag to export the
  Record ID, adding flexibility and precision to your exports.

  **Column Pattern Generator Fix**: We've addressed and fixed issues related to
  the column pattern generator, ensuring accurate and reliable data generation.

  **Column Count per Sheet**: We're now passing the column count to the generator
  for each sheet, optimizing data handling for your specific needs.

  **Improved Error Handling**: We've refined error handling to ensure that jobs
  are properly marked as failed in case of errors, providing better transparency
  and control.

  **File Cleanup**: To keep your Space clean and efficient, files are now
  automatically deleted after they have been successfully uploaded, promoting tidy
  data management.

  These updates collectively contribute to a smoother and more efficient workflow
  for your tasks.
</Update>

<Update label="10-17-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-extractor-xlsx@1.8.0`

  In this version, we've added a valuable enhancement to the Excel Extractor by
  exposing SheetJS's "raw" option. This option empowers users to preserve
  formatted text by default. When `raw` is set to true, the extractor will return
  the raw value, offering greater flexibility and control over extracted data.
</Update>

<Update label="10-13-2023" tags={["automations"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.1`

  Previously, initiating the "import" process, whether by dropping a file into a
  sheet or clicking the "Import" button from a file, created an unintended
  secondary `workbook:map` job. This secondary job was detected by the automap
  plugin, leading to duplicate entries in a sheet.

  In this version, we've introduced a solution to address this issue. We've added
  an "isAutomap" flag to the job's input, which allows the automap plugin to
  filter jobs accordingly. If the "isAutomap" flag is not provided, the automap
  plugin will gracefully exit, ensuring a more streamlined and error-free
  workflow.
</Update>

<Update label="10-11-2023" tags={["automations"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.1`

  Previously, when initiating the "import" process, which could be triggered by
  either dropping a file into a sheet or clicking the "Import" button from a file,
  a secondary `workbook:map` job was created. This unintentionally triggered the
  automap plugin, leading to duplicate entries within a sheet.

  In response to this issue, this version introduces an `isAutomap` flag within
  the job's input. The inclusion of this flag allows the automap plugin to apply
  appropriate filtering. If the flag is not provided, automap will gracefully exit
  without processing the job, thereby resolving the issue of duplicate entries in
  the sheet.
</Update>

<Update label="10-10-2023" tags={["automations"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.0`

  Previously, the Automap plugin exclusively matched the `defaultTargetSheet` with
  the `sheet.name` or `sheet.id`. In this update, we have expanded the matching
  capability to include the `sheet.slug`. This enhancement provides greater
  flexibility and precision when configuring default target sheets within the
  Automap plugin. This improvement is especially beneficial when you need to pass
  something like the sheet name + filename dynamically, making the mapping process
  even more versatile.
</Update>

<Update label="10-05-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/util-extractor@0.4.5`

  `util-extractor` is a crucial dependency used in all extractor plugins. We've
  made an important fix on the import method across all extractor plugins. If you
  previously encountered the following error message, you can now resolve this
  issue by updating to the latest extractor version.

  ```ssh
  Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@flatfile/api/api'
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="10-05-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-space-configure@0.1.4`

  An improvement was made to allow for configuring Spaces with no Workbooks.
</Update>

<Update label="09-27-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  **Major (Agent) Plugin-based Extraction Speed Improvements Just Went Live**

  We noticed the record insert portion of extraction taking far longer in plugins
  than in the core platform (with CSVs). We had to get to the bottom of why there
  was such a disparity and we’re thrilled to say we have a solution. **We’re
  seeing a 700k file that once took between 10-12 mins now only takes 1-1.5 min!**

  But wait, there’s more:

  Additionally, end users will now get updated percentages during the upload
  process and will receive a success message when the file is successfully
  extracted.

  Upgrade your extractor(s) to the latest to enjoy this optimization:

  * `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@1.7.5`
  * `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@0.7.3`
  * `@flatfile/plugin-json-extractor@0.6.4`
  * `@flatfile/plugin-pdf-extractor@0.0.5`
  * `@flatfile/plugin-xml-extractor@0.5.4`
  * `@flatfile/plugin-zip-extractor@0.3.7`

<Update label="09-20-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-psv-extractor@1.6.0` & `@flatfile/plugin-tsv-extractor@1.5.0`

  We're excited to announce that PSV and TSV file types, previously reliant on
  plugins, are now natively supported by the Flatfile Platform! 🚀

  As part of this enhancement, we've marked these plugins as deprecated.
  Developers will receive a friendly console log notification, making it clear
  that these plugins are no longer needed. Enjoy the streamlined experience!

  🚀 **Introducing `@flatfile/util-response-rejection`**

  ![image](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

  Meet `@flatfile/util-response-rejection`, a new utility for showcasing rejected
  Records *from an external API* to your customers. Managing rejected data during
  egress is vital for maintaining data accuracy, and this utility simplifies the
  entire process, ensuring a smoother experience for handling these instances.

  Here's what it does:

  1. Takes a `RejectionResponse` containing rejected Records and a rejection
     message.
  2. Locates the corresponding Record and adds the rejection message as an error
     to the Record cell.

  You can also utilize this utility directly with any listener.

</Update>

<Update label="09-08-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-extractor-___`

  All extractors have been fine-tuned to seamlessly handle extractions within a
  job, allowing the plugin more time to complete the extraction with less risk of
  the Agent timing out.

  Additionally, we've resolved a bug that was causing extractions to falsely
  indicate completion when running in parallel, ensuring extraction truly finishes
  before signaling completion.
</Update>

<Update label="09-08-2023" tags={["transform"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-autocast@0.2.2`

  Dates that were cast to a UTC string using the autocast plugin were showing as
  invalid after transformation. A fix for this was added to version 0.2.2.

</Update>

<Update label="09-01-2023" tags={["transform"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-autocast`

  In the most recent update, we’ve introduced some exciting enhancements. You can
  now implement an optional `fieldFilter` to specify which fields autocast should
  operate on.

  Check it out:

  ```jsx
  listener.use(autocast({ sheetSlug: "bar" }, ["numberField", "dateField"]));
  ```

<Update label="08-31-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  🚀 **Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-autocast`**

  Effortlessly transform data in your Sheets to align with the field types
  specified in the Blueprint.

  Supported field types:

  * **Numbers:** String numbers ('1'), string decimals ('1.1'), and string numbers
    with commas ('1,000') are interpreted as numbers.

  * **Booleans:**

    * Truthy values: '1', 'yes', 'true', 'on', ' ', 'y', and 1.
    * Falsy values: '- ', '0', 'no', 'false', 'off', ' ', 'n', 0, -1.

  * **Dates:** Date strings and numbers are cast to a UTC string (note:
    `YYYY-MM-DD...` is interpreted as an ISO 8601 date and is treated as treated
    as UTC, while other formats are treated as local time and converted to UTC).
    * '2023-08-16' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'

<Update label="08-30-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  **All extractors now support `chunkSize` and `parallel`**

  A new version of an underlying utility (`@flatfile/util-extractor`) introduces 2
  new options for extracting records in all extractor plugins:

  * `chunkSize`: (Default: 3,000) Define how many records you want to process in
    each batch. This allows you to balance efficiency and resource utilization
    based on your specific use case.
  * `parallel`: (Default: 1) Choose whether the records should be processed in
    parallel. This enables you to optimize the execution time when dealing with
    large datasets.

  *Note: Previously, we were extracting with a chunkSize of 1,000.*

  **Ex: Excel Usage: (See
  [docs](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-xlsx-extractor))**

  ```ts
  listener.use(ExcelExtractor({ chunkSize: 300, parallel: 2 }));
  ```

  If you update your extractor plugin to the latest, you will receive these new
  options.
</Update>

<Update label="08-25-2023" tags={["extractors"]}>
  `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor`

  Now that the platform includes native support for TSV and PSV files, developers
  are no longer required to use a plugin specifically for these formats. As a
  result of this enhancement, the documentation for the
  `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor` has been revised to reflect this update.

  For users who are already utilizing or have integrated a plugin for TSV and PSV
  files, there's no need to worry about any disruptions. While the extraction will
  occur twice, resulting in a "extraction complete" status being displayed twice,
  the process remains functional and intact.

# Personal Access Tokens
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/authentication/account-token

Create and manage user-scoped tokens for API authentication

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Overview

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide a secure way to authenticate with the Flatfile API. Unlike environment-specific API keys, PATs are user-scoped tokens that inherit the permissions of the user who created them.

Personal Access Tokens:

* Are user-scoped authentication tokens
* Have the same auth scope as the user who created them
* Can be used in place of a JWT for API authentication
* Are ideal for scripts, automation, and integrations that need to act on behalf of a user

This opens up possibilities for various use cases, including building audit logs, managing Spaces, and monitoring agents across environments.

## Managing Personal Access Tokens

### Creating a Token

1. Log in to your Flatfile account
2. Click on your user profile dropdown in the top-right corner
3. Select "Personal Access Tokens"
4. Click "Create Token"
5. Enter a descriptive name for your token
6. Copy the generated token immediately - it will only be shown once

<Note>
  Make sure to copy your token when it's first created. For security reasons, you won't be able to view the token again after leaving the page.
</Note>

### Retrieving a Personal Access Token (Legacy Method)

Your `publishableKey` and `secretKey` are specific to an environment. Therefore, to interact at a higher level, you can use a personal access token.

1. From the dashboard, open **Settings**

2. Click to **Personal Tokens**

3. Retrieve your `clientId` and `secret`.

4. Using the key pair, call the auth endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/auth -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"clientId":"1234-1234", "secret":"1234-1234"}'
```

5. The response will include an `accessToken`. Present that as your **Bearer `token`** in place of the `secretKey`.

### Using a Token

Use your Personal Access Token in API requests by including it in the Authorization header.

### Listing Tokens

You can view all your active tokens in the Personal Access Tokens page. For each token, you can see:

* Name
* Creation date
* Last used date (if applicable)

### Deleting Tokens

To delete a token:

1. Navigate to the Personal Access Tokens page
2. Find the token you want to delete
3. Click the menu icon (three dots) next to the token
4. Select "Delete"
5. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a token immediately revokes access for any applications or scripts using it. Make sure you update any dependent systems before deleting a token.
</Warning>

## Retrieving Account-Level Objects

With the obtained Personal Access Token, you can use it as a Bearer token in place of the `secretKey` to perform account-level queries. This allows you access to every object across the Account.

By using the personal access token, you can query for all events across all environments, list all users and guests, determine the number of Spaces and their presence in different environments, and identify environments with agents deployed.

## Example Use Cases

### Building an Audit Log

Query for all events across all environments and combine them with user and guest data to create a comprehensive audit log, providing a detailed history of actions within the application.

### Managing Spaces Across Environments

Determine the number of Spaces available and identify which Spaces exist in different environments, allowing you to efficiently manage and organize your data.

### Monitoring Agents Across Environments

Keep track of agents deployed to various environments by retrieving information about their presence, ensuring smooth and efficient data import processes.

## Best Practices

* Create separate tokens for different applications or use cases
* Use descriptive names that identify where the token will be used
* Regularly review and delete unused tokens
* Rotate tokens periodically for enhanced security
* Never share your tokens with others - each user should create their own tokens

## API Reference

For programmatic management of Personal Access Tokens, see the [Personal Access Tokens API Reference](/api-reference/auth/personal-access-tokens).


# API Keys
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/authentication/authentication

use API keys to authenticate API requests

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

<Info>
  API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers
  Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your API keys for
  each Environment.
</Info>

Flatfile provides two different kinds of environment-specific API keys you can
use to interact with the API. In addition, you can work with a development key
or a production environment.

Read on to learn more about how to think about which keys to use and how to test
in development mode.

## Testing and development

{/* prettier-ignore */}

<Tooltip tip="Learn more about Environments">[Environments](/learning-center/architecture/environments)</Tooltip> are isolated entities and are intended to be a safe place to create and
test different configurations. A `development` and `production` environment are created
by default.

| isProd  | Name          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *false* | `development` | Use this default environment, and its associated test API keys, as you build with Flatfile. |
| *true*  | `production`  | When you're ready to launch, create a new environment and swap out your keys.               |

<Note>
  The development environment does not count towards your paid credits.
</Note>

## Secret and publishable keys

All Accounts have two key types for each environment. Learn when to use each
type of key:

| Type            | Id                     | Description                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secret key      | `sk_23ghsyuyshs7dcrty` | **On the server-side:** Store this securely in your server-side code. Don’t expose this key in an application.          |
| Publishable key | `pk_23ghsyuyshs7dcert` | **On the client-side:** Can be publicly-accessible in your application's client-side code. Use when embedding Flatfile. |

<Note>
  The `accessToken` provided from `publishableKey` will remain valid for a
  duration of 24 hours.
</Note>


# Roles & Permissions
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/authentication/roles-and-permissions

grant your team and customers access

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Administrator Roles

Administrator roles have full access to your accounts, including inviting
additional admins and seeing developer keys.

<Note>
  The `accessToken` provided will remain valid for a duration of 24 hours.
</Note>

| Role          | Details                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administrator | This role is meant for any member of your team who requires full access to the Account.<br /> <br />✓ Can add other administrators <br />✓ Can view secret keys <br />✓ Can view logs |

## Guest Roles

Guest roles receive access via a magic link or a shared link depending on the
[Environment](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard) `guestAuthentication`
type. Guests roles can invite other Guests unless you turn off this setting in
the [Guest Sidebar](/learning-center/guides/guest_sidebar).

<Note>
  The `accessToken` provided will remain valid for a duration of 1 hour.
</Note>

### Space Grant

| Role               | Details                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-Space Guest | This role is meant for a guest who has access to only one Space. Such guests can be invited to additional Spaces at any time.                                  |
| Multi-Space Guest  | This role is meant for a guest who has access to multiple Spaces. They will see a drop-down next to the Space name that enables them to switch between Spaces. |

### Workbook Grant

| Role                  | Details                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single-Workbook Guest | This role is meant for a guest who should have access to only one Workbook within a Space. |
| Multi-Workbook Guest  | This role is intended for a guest who has access to multiple Workbooks within a Space.     |

<Info>This role can only be configured using code. See code example.</Info>

```js
const createGuest = await api.guests.create({
  environmentId: "us_env_hVXkXs0b",
  email: "guest@example.com",
  name: "Mr. Guest",
  spaces: [
    {
      id: "us_sp_DrdXetPN",
      workbooks: [
        {
          id: "us_wb_qGZbKwDW",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Guest Lifecycle

When a guest user is deleted, all their space connections are automatically removed to ensure security. This means:

* The guest loses access to all previously connected spaces
* They cannot regain access to these spaces without being explicitly re-invited

This automatic cleanup ensures that deleted guests cannot retain any access to spaces, even if they are later recreated with the same email address.


# Managing Agents
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management

manage your agents with the Flatfile CLI

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Listing Agents

To view all agents in your environment, use the following command:

```bash
npx flatfile agents list
```

## Downloading Agents

To `download`command allows you to download a copy of the agent's source code to your local machine. This is useful when you need to:

* Examine the code of a deployed agent
* Make modifications to an existing agent
* Back up your agent code
* Debug issues with a deployed agent

To download an agent, use the following command:

```bash
npx flatfile agents download <slug>
```

<Tip>
  Use the `list` command to get the slug or id of the agent you want to manage.
</Tip>

## Delete An Agent

The `delete` command allows you to remove a deployed agent from your Flatfile environment. This is useful when you no longer need an agent or want to clean up your environment.

To delete an agent, use the following command:

`npx flatfile delete <slug>`

### Options

| Option               | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `--slug` or `-s`     | The slug of the agent to delete |
| `--agentId` or `-ag` | The ID of the agent to delete   |


# Deploying
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/core-libraries/cli/deploy

npx flatfile deploy

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

For a production deployment, listeners can be hosted either in your cloud or
directly on the Flatfile platform.

## Flatfile-Hosted Agents  (Recommended)

While your own cloud provides the maximum level of control over listener code,
qualities such as availability and network performance are the responsibility of
the hosting provider. Flatfile offers tooling to deploy and manage Listeners securely hosted
and run in the Flatfile cloud giving you a more consistent, low-latency, high-availability
experience.

### Deploying An Agent

Once you have configured your a local configuration running, bundling and deploying
your listener to the flatfile cloud can be done in a single command.

```
npx flatfile deploy
```

The CLI will attempt to locate the entrypoint of your listener in the following order:

* `./index.js,`
* `./index.ts`
* `./src/index.js`
* `./src/index.ts`

If your listener is in another location you can provide the path as an argument:

```
npx flatfile deploy ./path-to/listener.ts
```

The CLI will provide updates as it's deploying:

```terminal
> npx flatfile deploy
✔  Code package compiled to .flatfile/build.js
✔  Code package passed validation
✔  Environment "production" selected
✔  Event listener deployed and running on your environment "production". us_ag_1234
```

<Tip>
  Set your target environment `FLATFILE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` and API token `FLATFILE_API_KEY` in your .env file to avoid entering them when prompted.
</Tip>

### Dashboard Management

You can view and manage agents via the Flatfile Dashboard. The dashboard provides a simple interface for monitoring and controlling your deployed agents with the following capabilities:

| Feature               | Description                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| View Agent            | Access details about your deployed agents including their latest deployment and last received event |
| View Logs             | Monitor agent activity and troubleshoot issues by examining execution logs                          |
| Download Agent Code   | Retrieve the deployed code for reference, backup, or refactoring purposes                           |
| Delete Agent          | Remove agents that are no longer needed from your environment                                       |
| Revert Agent          | Roll back to a previous version if issues arise with newer deployments                              |
| Deploy Library Agents | Deploy pre-built agents from the Flatfile Agent Library                                             |

### Re-Deploying

To update the code in your listener simply make the update your desire re-deploy.
Agents are versioned and you may revert to a previous version at any time via the dashboard.

### Multiple Agents

To deploy a second Agent without overwriting the first, specify a unique slug:

```terminal
npx flatfile deploy -s pink
```

When you pass a slug, the CLI will create a new Agent with the specified
slug. This allows you to deploy multiple Agents to the same environment.

To update an existing Agent, you can specify the slug of the Agent you want to
update by running the same command, including the slug.

<Note>
  If you do not specify a slug and have only one or no deployed Agents the CLI
  will update your existing Agent, or create your first Agent. The slug for this
  agent will be `default`.
</Note>

## Hosting on Regional Servers

<Tip>
  To deploy on a regional server, please contact our support team.
</Tip>

Regional servers are available upon request for those needing to host their
applications closer to their user base, ensuring faster access and compliance
with local data regulations.

### URL References

| Region | URL / SPACE\_URL         | API URL                      |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| UK     | platform.uk.flatfile.com | platform.uk.flatfile.com/api |
| EU     | platform.eu.flatfile.com | platform.eu.flatfile.com/api |
| AU     | platform.au.flatfile.com | platform.au.flatfile.com/api |
| CA     | platform.ca.flatfile.com | platform.ca.flatfile.com/api |

### Configuring API URL

When deploying, you can specify the `FLATFILE_API_URL` either in your project's
`.env` file or as an environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash .env
  FLATFILE_API_URL=platform.eu.flatfile.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Embedding Via Space URL

To embed Flatfile in your application, include both apiUrl and spaceUrl in your
FlatfileImporter configuration to specify your regional server:

```typescript
const spaceProps: ISpace = {
  name: "Embedded Space",
  publishableKey: "pk_**********",
  apiUrl: "Regional API URL here",
  spaceUrl: "Regional Space URL here",
  workbook,
  listener,
  // Additional properties here
};
```

### Configure API Client Environment

For direct API interactions, the FlatfileClient needs the environment parameter
set to your selected regional API URL:

```ts
import { FlatfileClient } from "@flatfile/api";

const api = new FlatfileClient({
  environment: "Regional API URL here",
});
```

## Self-Hosting

Hosting listener code in your own cloud works similarly to how we run the
`develop` command in that:

1. The listener process is launched
2. It polls the Flatfile API for updates
3. It then responds to those Events accordingly

Reach out to support for learning how about hosting in your own cloud.

## Related Commands

* [develop](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/develop) - Run a local listener for development
* [list](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management#listing-agents) - List all deployed agents in your environment
* [download-agent](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management#downloading-agents) - Download an agent from your environment
* [delete](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management#delete-an-agent) - Delete an agent from your environment


# Developing
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/core-libraries/cli/develop

npx flatfile develop

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

The Flatfile CLI provides a suite of tools to help you develop and deploy
[Listeners](/learning-center/concepts/listeners) to Flatfile.

Listeners are at the core of the Flatfile ecosystem, they are responsible for
picking up on [Events](/learning-center/concepts/events) and responding to them
accordingly.

<Note>
  Agents are listeners deployed server-side on Flatfile's secure cloud.
</Note>

When developing with Flatfile, listeners can [deployed](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/deploy) to
Flatfile on every change, or they can run directly on your machine.

### Commands

The Flatfile CLI provides the following commands:

| Command  | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| develop  | Run your project as a local listener    |
| deploy   | Deploy your project as a Flatfile Agent |
| list     | List deployed Agents in an environment  |
| download | Download an agent from your environment |
| delete   | Delete an Agent                         |

### Before You Begin

You can add a `.env` file to bypass having to enter your API Key when running
the develop command.

```json
FLATFILE_API_KEY=sk_123456
```

### Develop

Run `npx flatfile develop` from terminal to launch a local listener. As your
code changes, file changes are detected and will be reflected immediately.

<Warning>
  Add the file name to the command: `npx flatfile develop path-to-file` if
  you're not running an index file.
</Warning>

1. In your terminal, you'll see a detailed log of each HTTP request made within
   a listener. It includes the request timing and status, enabling tracking and
   debugging of HTTP operations.
2. A pub/sub stream system will deliver Events with a latency of approximately
   10-50ms. This provides a local development experience closely resembling the
   production environment speed.
3. Events that are being processed will be shown, along with their respective
   handlers. You can then respond to those Events accordingly.

```bash
> npx flatfile develop
✔ 1 environment(s) found for these credentials
✔ Environment "development" selected
ncc: Version 0.36.1
ncc: Compiling file index.js into CJS
  ✓ 427ms      GET    200 https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/subscription 12345

 File change detected. 🚀
  ✓ Connected to event stream for scope us_env_1234
 ▶ commit:created  10:13:05.159 AM us_evt_1234
 ↳ on(**, {})
 ↳ on(commit:created, {"sheetSlug":"contacts"})

```

## Shared Environments

It is highly recommended to utilize an isolated environment when developing with
the local listener. That's why the CLI is warning you when working in an
environment that already has a deployed agent.

Having deployed code running at the same time within the same development
environment can lead to interference, potentially resulting in a recursive loop
and undesirable consequences for your local listener.

To avoid such complications, it's advisable to keep your local environment
separate from any deployed code. This ensures optimal performance and helps
maintain a stable development environment.


# CLI
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/core-libraries/cli/overview

Flatfile Command Line Interface

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

The Flatfile Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a set of tools to help you develop, deploy, and manage [Listeners](/learning-center/concepts/listeners) in your Flatfile environment.

<Note>
  Once listeners deployed are and hosted on Flatfile's secure cloud, they are called Agents.
</Note>

## Installation

The Flatfile CLI is available as an npm package and can be invoked with npx.

```
npx flatfile@latest <command>
```

## Authentication

To interact with the agents in your environment, you must authenticate with your Flatfile API key. You may do so in two ways:

1. Pass your credentials with your command via the the `--token` and `--env` flags
2. Making the `FLATFILE_API_KEY` and `FLATFILE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` variables available in your environment, via `.env` file in your project directory or other configurations

## Available Commands

| Command                                                                           | Description                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [develop](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/develop)                              | Run your project as a local listener for development |
| [deploy](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/deploy)                                | Deploy your project as a Flatfile Agent              |
| [list](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management#listing-agents)         | List all deployed Agents in your environment         |
| [download](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management#downloading-agents) | Download an agent from your environment              |
| [delete](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management#delete-an-agent)      | Delete an Agent from your environment                |

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow with the Flatfile CLI looks like this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="develop locally">
    Configure your listener in local development using the develop command.

    This command runs your listener locally.
    It will respond to events in your configured environment just as it would once deployed,
    but changes to your listener will be watched so you can test changes in real-time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="deploy to the flatfile cloud">
    When ready, use the deploy command to deploy your listener as an Agent.

    To facilitate easy management, name your listener via the `--slug/-s` flag.
  </Step>

  <Step title="managing agents">
    Use the list command to view deployed Agents and the delete command to remove them when needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="download deployed agents">
    Use the download to retrieve the code of a deployed Agent for inspection or modification.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environment Isolation

It's recommended to use an isolated environment for development to avoid conflicts with deployed Agents. The CLI will warn you if you're working in an environment that already has deployed Agents.

# Listener
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/core-libraries/listener

@flatfile/listener

The Flatfile Listener is a core building block of the Flatfile platform.
Listening and responding to events is what enables developers to build powerful
integrations with Flatfile. This package enables you to handle all the events in
your data pipeline — from the moment data arrives to its final transformation.
Think of it as your event command center.

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Listener } from "@flatfile/listener";

export default (listener: Listener) => {
  listener.on("**", (event) => {
    console.log(event);
  });
};
```

## Core Components

Let's explore the building blocks that make the Listener powerful.

### Working with Records

These classes give you full control over your data, letting you read, modify,
and validate records with ease.

### Managing Sessions

Keep tabs on everything happening in your workspace — from active uploads to
schema changes.

### Event Handling

Catch and respond to any action in your data pipeline. Whether it's new data
arriving or a validation completing, you're in control.

### Authentication

Handle API calls securely with built-in authentication and header management.

# Embed Flatfile
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/angular/new_space

create a new Space every time Flatfile is opened

For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new
Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate
for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

Follow prompts from the `new` command.

```bash
ng new create-flatfile-angular-embed
```

```bash
cd create-flatfile-angular-embed
```

```bash
npm i @flatfile/angular-sdk @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/listener
```

### Build your importer

### 1. Initialize Flatfile

In your `app.component.ts` you'll need to pass in a minimum of the
`publishableKey`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/app/app.component.ts
  import { Component } from '@angular/core';
  import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
  import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
  import { SpaceModule, SpaceService, ISpace } from '@flatfile/angular-sdk';

  @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet, SpaceModule],
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
  })
  export class AppComponent {
    title = 'create-flatfile-angular-embed';
    showSpace: boolean = false;

    constructor(private spaceService: SpaceService) {}

    toggleSpace() {
      this.spaceService.OpenEmbed();
      this.showSpace = !this.showSpace;
    }

    closeSpace() {
      this.showSpace = false;
    }

    spaceProps: ISpace = {
      name: 'my space!',
      publishableKey: 'pk_1234',
      closeSpace: {
        operation: 'submitActionFg',
        onClose: this.closeSpace.bind(this),
      },
      displayAsModal: true,
    }
  }
  ```

  ```html src/app/app.component.html
  <main class="main">
    <div class="description">
      <button (click)="toggleSpace()">
        {{ showSpace ? 'Close' : 'Open' }} space
      </button>
    </div>
    <div class="spaceWrapper" *ngIf="showSpace">
      <flatfile-space [spaceProps]="spaceProps"></flatfile-space>
    </div>
  </main>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Start your client

Now, start your front end by heading to the terminal and running the following
command.

```bash
  npm run start
```

### 3. Build a workbook

Now, let’s build a Workbook inside the Space for next time.

Add your `config.ts` file, and place the following code in it. After you have
done so, import the configuration to `app.component.ts`, and update `spaceProps`
to have the value of `config` under `workbook`. This config file has the
configuration settings for your workbook, so feel free to edit however necessary
to meet your needs.

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/config.ts
    import { Flatfile } from "@flatfile/api";

    export const config: Pick<
      Flatfile.CreateWorkbookConfig,
      "name" | "sheets" | "actions"
    > = {
      name: "Employees workbook",
      sheets: [
        {
          name: "TestSheet",
          slug: "TestSheet",
          fields: [
            {
              key: "first_name",
              type: "string",
              label: "First name",
              constraints: [
                {
                  type: "required",
                },
              ],
            },
            {
              key: "last_name",
              type: "string",
              label: "last name",
            },
            {
              key: "email",
              type: "string",
              label: "Email",
            },
          ],
          actions: [
            {
              label: "Join fields",
              operation: "TestSheet:join-fields",
              description: "Would you like to join fields?",
              mode: "foreground",
              confirm: true,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      actions: [
        {
          label: "Submit",
          operation: "TestSheet:submit",
          description: "Would you like to submit your workbook?",
          mode: "foreground",
          primary: true,
          confirm: true,
        },
      ],
    };

  ```

  ```TypeScript src/app/app.component.ts
  spaceProps: ISpace = {
      name: 'my space!',
      publishableKey: 'pk_1234',
      closeSpace: {
        operation: 'submitActionFg',
        onClose: this.closeSpace.bind(this),
      },
      displayAsModal: true,
      workbook: config,
    };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Transform Data

Next, we'll listen for data changes and respond using an event listener.

1. Add a `src/listeners/listener.ts` file with this simple `recordHook`.
2. Update `app.component.ts` to import the listener.

Once you add this code, when a change occurs, we'll log the entered first name
and update the last name to "Rock." You'll immediately see this begin to work
when you add or update any records. Learn more about
[Handling Data](/learning-center/guides/handling-data)

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/listeners/listener.ts
  import api from "@flatfile/api";
  import { FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";
  import { recordHook } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";

  /**
   * Example Listener
   */
  export const listener = FlatfileListener.create((listener) => {
    listener.on("**", (event) => {
      console.log(`Received event:`, event);
    });

    listener.use(
      recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
        const firstName = record.get("firstName");
        console.log({ firstName });
        record.set("lastName", "Rock");
        return record;
      })
    );

    listener.filter({ job: "workbook:submitActionFg" }, (configure) => {
      configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { jobId } }) => {
        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Getting started.",
            progress: 10,
          });

          // Make changes after cells in a Sheet have been updated
          console.log("Make changes here when an action is clicked");

          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              acknowledge: true,
              message: "This is now complete.",
              next: {
                type: "wait",
              },
            },
          });
        } catch (error: any) {
          console.error("Error:", error.stack);

          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: "This job encountered an error.",
            },
          });
        }
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/app/app.component.ts
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet, SpaceModule],
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrl: './app.component.css'
  })
  export class AppComponent {
    title = 'create-flatfile-angular-embed';
    showSpace: boolean = false;

    constructor() {}

    toggleSpace() {
      this.showSpace = !this.showSpace;
    }

    closeSpace() {
      this.showSpace = false;
    }

    spaceProps: ISpace = {
      name: 'my space!',
      publishableKey: 'pk_1234',
      closeSpace: {
        operation: 'submitActionFg',
        onClose: this.closeSpace.bind(this),
      },
      displayAsModal: true,
      workbook: config,
      listener
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Match your brand

By attaching a `themeConfig` to `spaceProps`, we will now override colors in
your Space to match your brand. See all of the options here in the
[Theming Reference](/learning-center/guides/theming).

```typescript
  themeConfig: {
    root: {
      primaryColor: "red",
      textColor: "white",
      logo: "https://images.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/gL6Blz3kTPdZXWknuIDVx/7bb7c73d93b111ed542d2ed426b42fd5/flatfile.svg",
    },
  },
```

You can stop here or you can [view our full reference](../reference/common) to
see all the ways you can customize your importer.

# Reuseable Spaces
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/angular/reuse_space

reuse a Space when Flatfile is opened

For applications meant to use the same space consistently, open an existing
space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where consistently
editing a dataset is preferred.

## Before you begin

If you have already tried our [Embed a New Space](./new_space) guide you will
notice this guide departs heavily, so you will want to create this in a new
directory, as translation would be more difficult than creating from scratch.

<Snippet file="shared/sk_needed.mdx" />

Follow prompts from the `new` command.

```bash
ng new create-flatfile-angular-embed
```

```bash
cd create-flatfile-angular-embed
```

```bash
npm i
```

Install Packages

```bash
npm i @flatfile/api @flatfile/listener @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/angular-sdk @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/listener express && npm i --save-dev concurrently nodemon ts-node
```

#### 1. Set up Configuration Files

This app has some configuration files that must be set up before you can get
started with development. Set them up as shown below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```JSON nodemon.json
  {
    "watch": ["server"],
    "ext": "ts,json",
    "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
    "exec": "ts-node --esm ./server/index.ts"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You will also want to add some scripts to your `package.json` to start the app.
Add the following scripts:

```JSON pacakge.json (snippet)
"scripts": {
  "dev:frontend": "ng serve",
  "dev:backend": "nodemon",
  "dev": "concurrently 'npx tsc --watch' 'npm:dev:frontend' 'npm:dev:backend'",
},
```

#### 2. Create the Server

Lets create the server that will act as the backend of the application. This
will be necessary to serve the pages as well as get the existing space, as due
to security reasons the Secret Key cannot be exposed to the browser at any time.
You'll want to replace the token value with your secret key or api token.

```TypeScript server/index.ts
import express from "express";

import { FlatfileClient } from "@flatfile/api";

const port = 3000;
const app = express();

app.get('/api/spaces/:id', async (_req, res)=>{
  const {id} = _req.params;
  const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
    token: 'secret_key',
    environment: 'https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1',
  });
  try {
    const space = await flatfile.spaces.get(id);
    res.json({ space });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error retrieving space:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to retrieve space" });
  }
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port", port);
});
```

#### 3. Build your existing Space Component

The component should end up looking something like this:

```TypeScript src/app/app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
import { SpaceModule, ISpace } from '@flatfile/angular-sdk';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet, SpaceModule],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'create-flatfile-angular';
  showSpace: boolean = false;

  constructor(private spaceService: SpaceService) {}

  toggleSpace() {
    this.spaceService.OpenEmbed();
    this.showSpace = !this.showSpace;
  }

  closeSpace() {
    this.showSpace = false;
  }

  spaceProps: ISpace = {
    space: {
      id: 'us_sp_1234',
      accessToken: 'sk_1234'
    },
    closeSpace: {
      operation: 'submitActionFg',
      onClose: this.closeSpace.bind(this),
    },
    displayAsModal: true,
  }

  fetchData = async (spaceId: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/spaces/${spaceId}`);
    const json = await response.json();

    if(json.error){
      return
    }

    if(this.spaceProps.space) {
      this.spaceProps.space.accessToken = json.space.data.accessToken;
    }
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    if(this.spaceProps.space?.id){
      this.fetchData(this.spaceProps.space.id).catch(
        (err) => {
          console.error(err)
        }
      );
    }
  }
}
```

You'll need to update your `app.component.html` to include the existing space
component. It should end up looking like the below:

```html src/app/app.component.html
<main class="main">
  <div class="description">
    <button (click)="toggleSpace()">
      {{ showSpace ? 'Close' : 'Open' }} space
    </button>
  </div>
  <div class="spaceWrapper" *ngIf="showSpace">
    <flatfile-space [spaceProps]="spaceProps"></flatfile-space>
  </div>
</main>
```

#### 6. Start your client

Now you should be able to start your app. To load it in dev mode and ensure
everything works proprly, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you have any errors, now is your time to fix them up, else you're ready to
deploy!

# Embed Flatfile
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/javascript/new_space

create a new Space every time Flatfile is opened

For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new
Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate
for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

## Prepare your project

### Install packages

Make a new directory.

```bash
mkdir example-flatfile-js-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd example-flatfile-js-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```

Install packages. (We'll use `parcel` for bundling.)

```bash
npm i @flatfile/javascript @flatfile/listener @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/api flatfile
```

Install dev packages.

```bash
npm i parcel --save-dev
```

### Create your file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
├── public/
   └── index.html
   └── styles.css
├── src/
   └── client.js
   └── workbook.js
   └── listener.js
├── package.json <--- already created
└── package-lock.json <--- already created
```

In this file structure, your app should have two main directories, `public` and
`src.`

The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file, which is the entry point
of the application's front-end, and the `styles.css` file for styling the
iframe.

The `src` directory contains the main components and logic of the application,
including the `client.js` file, which initializes Flatfile and passes in
available options.

## Build your importer

### 1. Add a Flatfile button

Add a button to your application to open Flatfile in a modal. Pass in your
`publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load. Also, add
the content here to your `styles.css`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html public/index.html (snippet)
  <button
    onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'pk_1234'})"
  >
    Create new Space
  </button>
  ```

  ```html public/index.html (full page)
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <title>Hello, world!</title>
      <script type="module" src="../src/client.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
          <h2><code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code></h2>
          <p>Embed Flatfile in just a few lines of code.</p>

          <!-- Button to trigger the modal -->
          <div>
            <!-- Note: PUT YOUR KEY AND ENVIRONMENT_ID IN HERE -->
            <button
              class="contrast"
              onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'pk_1234' })"
            >
              Create new Space
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="flatfile_iFrameContainer"></div>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  <Snippet file="shared/iframeStyles.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Initialize Flatfile

In your `client.js`, at minimum, you'll need to receive the `publishableKey` set
from when you called `openFlatfile`.

```js src/client.js
import { initializeFlatfile } from "@flatfile/javascript";

//create a new space in modal
window.openFlatfile = ({ publishableKey }) => {
  if (!publishableKey) {
    throw new Error(
      "You must provide a publishable key - pass through in index.html",
    );
  }
  const flatfileOptions = {
    name: "Embedded Space",
    publishableKey,
    externalActorId: 'test-1',
    sidebarConfig: {
      showSidebar: false,
    },
    closeSpace: {
      operation: "submitActionFg",
      onClose: () => {
        //custom code if needed
      },
    },
    // Additional props...
  };

  initializeFlatfile(flatfileOptions);
};
```

### 3. Start your client

Now, start your front end by heading to terminal and running the following
command. To see that it’s running, visit: [https://localhost:1234](https://localhost:1234) (or the port it
is running on) and you should see your page and a button. Click the button and
see that an empty Space gets created.

```bash
npx parcel public/index.html
```

<Snippet file="shared/embedded_listener.mdx" />

### 8. Customize

You can stop here or you can [view our full reference](../reference/common) to
see all the ways you can customize your importer.

# Reusable Spaces
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/javascript/reuse_space

reuse a Space when Flatfile is opened

Reuse a Space when users might need to wait or can't finish in one go. It's
great for keeping work context and letting users continue where they left off
until the task is done.

## Before you begin

To reuse an existing Space, we'll update our files to pass in a Space Id instead
of a `publishableKey`. We'll then make a server-side request using our
`secretKey` to get the Space and its access token.

<Snippet file="shared/sk_needed.mdx" />

<Snippet file="shared/guestauth.mdx" />

## Prepare your project

### Install packages

Make a new directory.

```bash
mkdir reuse-example-flatfile-js-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd reuse-example-flatfile-js-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```

Install packages.

```bash
npm i @flatfile/javascript @flatfile/listener @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/api cors dotenv express flatfile
```

Install dev packages.

```bash
npm i parcel --save-dev
```

### Create your file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
├── public/
   └── index.html
   └── styles.css
├── src/
   └── client.js
   └── server.mjs
├── .env
├── package.json <--- already created
└── package-lock.json <--- already created
```

In this file structure, your app should have two main directories, `public` and
`src.`

The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file, which is the entry point
of the application's front-end, and the "style.css" file for styling the iframe.

The `src` directory contains the main components and logic of the application,
including the `client.js` file, which initializes Flatfile and passes in
available options, and the `server.mjs` file, which sets up a Node.js server
using Express that listens for incoming requests and communicates with the
Flatfile API to retrieve data about a specified Space.

### Update your .env

Update your .env. `FLATFILE_API_KEY` is your Secret Key and `SPACE_ID` is the
Space you want to open in the importer. This is can be found on your Dashboard
where it lists your Spaces. You shouldn't need to update the `BASE_URL`.

```
BASE_URL=https://platform.flatfile.com/api
FLATFILE_API_KEY=sk_1234
SPACE_ID=us_sp_1234
```

## Build your importer

### 1. Add a Flatfile button

Add a button to your application to open Flatfile in a modal. Pass in your
`publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load. Also, add
the content here to your `styles.css`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html public/index.html (snippet)
  <button
    onclick="openFlatfile()"
  >
    Open existing Space
  </button>
  ```

  ```html public/index.html (full page)
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <title>Hello, world!</title>
      <script type="module" src="../src/client.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
          <h2><code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code></h2>
          <p>Embed Flatfile in just a few lines of code.</p>

          <!-- Button to trigger the modal -->
          <div>
            <button class="contrast" onclick="openFlatfile()">
              Open existing Space
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="flatfile_iFrameContainer"></div>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  <Snippet file="shared/iframeStyles.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Create a local server

This code sets up a Node.js server using Express that listens for incoming
requests, enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and communicates with
the Flatfile API to retrieve data about a specified Space based on the provided
environment variables.

```jsx src/server.mjs
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import express from "express";
import { FlatfileClient } from "@flatfile/api";
import cors from "cors"; // Import the cors module

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

console.log(process.env.SPACE_ID);
console.log(process.env.FLATFILE_API_KEY);

const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
  token: process.env.FLATFILE_API_KEY,
  environment: process.env.BASE_URL + "/v1",
});

// Enable CORS middleware
app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});

app.get("/space", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const space = await flatfile.spaces.get(process.env.SPACE_ID);
    res.json(space);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error retrieving space:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to retrieve space" });
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### 3. Start your server

Now, start your server by heading to terminal and running the following command.
To see that it’s running, visit: [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) (or the port it is
running on) and you should see a page that says "Hello, World".

```bash
npx node src/server.mjs
```

### 4. Initialize Flatfile

In your `client.js`, at minimum, you'll need to get and pass the `space` info.
This code opens an existing Space in a modal by making a request to your server
endpoint and initializing the Flatfile data import with specified options based
on the server's response.

```js src/client.js
import { initializeFlatfile } from "@flatfile/javascript";
const server_url = "http://localhost:8080";

//open existing space in modal
window.openFlatfile = () => {
  fetch(server_url + "/space") // Make a request to the server endpoint
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((space) => {
      const flatfileOptions = {
        space: {
          id: space && space.data && space.data.id,
          accessToken: space && space.data && space.data.accessToken,
        },
        sidebarConfig: {
          showSidebar: false,
        },
        externalActorId: 'test-1',
        // Additional props...
      };
      initializeFlatfile(flatfileOptions);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error retrieving space in client:", error);
    });
};
```

### 5. Start your client

Now, start your front end by heading to terminal, opening a new tab, and running
the following command. To see that it’s running, visit: [https://localhost:1234](https://localhost:1234)
(or the port it is running on) and you should see your page and a button. Click
the button and see that your Space loads. **That's it!**

```bash
npx parcel public/index.html
```

# Components
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/react/components

configure your Space in React

## Components

### FlatfileProvider

`FlatfileProvider` is a comprehensive React component designed for integrating
Flatfile's import capabilities into your application. It can be initialized
using either a `publishableKey` or an `accessToken`, providing flexibility
depending on your authentication flow. The component allows for extensive
customization of the embedded iFrame through styling parameters, ensuring that
the import modal matches your application's aesthetics. It maintains the
configuration necessary for creating and managing Spaces, Workbooks, and
Documents within Flatfile. Additionally, `FlatfileProvider` manages a
client-side listener to handle browser-based events, ensuring a seamless user
interaction with the import process.

Learn more about the
[FlatfileProvider](/documentation/sdks/react/components/FlatfileProvider)

```tsx
<FlatfileProvider
  publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
  config={{
    mountElement,
    exitText,
    exitTitle,
    exitPrimaryButtonText,
    exitSecondaryButtonText,
    displayAsModal: true,
    externalActorId: 'test-1',
  }}
>
  <FFApp />
</FlatfileProvider>
```

### Space

The `Space` component from the `@flatfile/react` package is utilized to define a
collaborative environment or workspace within Flatfile's import system. It can
be configured to create a new space or to reuse an existing one by providing a
space ID.

#### Main Props

* `config`: Sets up the configuration for a new space, including theming and
  metadata.
* `id`: An optional prop that, when provided, indicates the specific existing
  space to be reused instead of creating a new one.

Learn more about the [Space](/documentation/sdks/react/components/Space)

Example usage for creating a new space:

```tsx
<Space
  config={{
    metadata: {
      sidebarConfig: {
        showSidebar: true,
      },
    },
  }}
/>
```

When you want to re-use a space, you'll need to pass an `accessToken` to the
`FlatfileProvider`, then this is where you'll add the `id` of the Space you want
to re-use.

```tsx
const FFApp = () => <Space id={"us_sp_123456"} />;
const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlatfileProvider accessToken={ACCESS_TOKEN}>
      <FFApp />
    </FlatfileProvider>
  );
};
```

### Workbook

Configures all Workbook Creation request data and a new onRecordHook helper
function

`onSubmit` and a new `onRecordHooks` helper can be added to the Workbook. A
Workbook object containing the sheets can be passed along in the `config`.
`onRecordHooks` takes an array of record hooks. Each one can take a slug for
manually setting each per sheet. Otherwise, if no slug is added, it will apply
the record hook to the corresponding sheet in the Workbook index.

Learn more about the [Workbook](/documentation/sdks/react/components/Workbook)

```tsx
<Workbook
  config={workbook}
  onSubmit={(sheet) => {
    console.log("onSubmit", { sheet });
  }}
  onRecordHooks={[
    [
      "contacts",
      (record) => {
        record.set("email", "TEST SHEET RECORD");
        return record;
      },
    ],
  ]}
/>
```

### Sheet

The `Sheet` component from the `@flatfile/react` package integrates Flatfile's
data import functionality into React applications. It simplifies configuring the
data import process and managing the lifecycle of data submission and record
handling.

#### Main Props

* `config`: Defines the structure and settings of the data to be imported.
* `onSubmit`: A callback function that is triggered upon successful data
  submission.
* `onRecordHook`: A function that allows for custom record manipulation during
  the import process.
* `submitSettings`: Customizes the behavior of the data submission process.

The Sheet option is similar to the
[Simplified SDK Approach](documentation/sdks/reference/simple). Learn more about
the [Sheet](/documentation/sdks/react/components/Sheet)

Example usage:

```tsx
<Sheet
  config={sheet}
  onRecordHook={(record) => {
    record.set("email", "TEST SHEET RECORD");
    return record;
  }}
  onSubmit={(sheet) => {
    console.log("onSubmit", { sheet });
  }}
/>
```

### Document

Configures a Document to be added to the Space. Takes a simple
`Flatfile.DocumentConfig` as a param.

```tsx
const FFApp = () => <Document config={document} />;
```

## React Hooks 🪝

### useFlatfile

This Hook exposes a few handy functions for integrating with the
FlatfileProvider

* `openPortal()`: Opens the iFrame. This will create the underlying Space,
  Workbook and configure if necessary or open the Space provided.
* `closePortal()`: Closes the iFrame.
* `open`: current open status
* `listener`: Current listener
* `setListener()`: manually sets the listener

### useListener

This Hook exposes and adds any logic to the current listener with conditional
dependencies

```tsx
useListener(
  (listener) => {
    listener.on("**", (event) => {
      console.log("initialListener Event => ", event.topic);
      // Handle the workbook:deleted event
    });
  },
  [label],
);
```

### usePlugin

This Hook exposes and adds a plugin to the current listener with conditional
dependencies

```tsx
usePlugin(
  recordHook("contacts", (record, event) => {
    console.log("recordHook", { event });
    record.set("lastName", label);
    return record;
  }),
  [label],
);
```

### useEvent

This Hook exposes any event coming from the iFrame to respond to with proper
filtering

```tsx
useEvent("workbook:created", (event) => {
  console.log("workbook:created", { event });
});

useEvent("*:created", (event) => {
  console.log({ topic: event.topic });
});

useEvent("job:ready", { job: "sheet:submitActionFg" }, async (event) => {
  const { jobId } = event.context;
  try {
    await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
      info: "Getting started.",
      progress: 10,
    });

    // Make changes after cells in a Sheet have been updated
    console.log("Make changes here when an action is clicked");
    const records = await event.data;

    console.log({ records });

    await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message: "This is now complete.",
      },
    });

    // Probably a bad idea to close the portal here but just as an example
    await sleep(3000);
    closePortal();
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error:", error.stack);

    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message: "This job encountered an error.",
      },
    });
  }
});
```

## Full Example

      })
      importedListener
    },
    [lastName]

create a new Space every time Flatfile is opened

For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new
Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate
for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

## Prepare your project

### Install packages

Make a new directory.

```bash
mkdir example-flatfile-react-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd example-flatfile-react-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```

Install packages.

```bash
npm i @flatfile/react @flatfile/listener @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/api flatfile react react-dom react-scripts
```

### Create your file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
├── public/
   └── index.html
   └── styles.css
├── src/
   └── App.tsx
   └── index.tsx
   └── workbook.ts (wait to add this)
   └── listener.ts (wait to add this)
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json <--- already created
└── package-lock.json <--- already created
```

In this file structure, your app should have two main directories, `public` and
`src.`

The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file, which is the entry point
of the application's front-end, and the "style.css" file for styling the iframe.

The `src` directory contains the main components and logic of the application,
including the `App.tsx` file, which initializes Flatfile and passes in available
options.

## Build your importer

### 1. Add a Flatfile button

Add a button to your application to open Flatfile in a modal. Pass in your
`publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load. Also, add
the content here to your `styles.css`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html public/index.html (full page)
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
      <meta
        name="description"
        content="Web site created using create-react-app"
      />
      <!--
        manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
        user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
      -->
      <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
      <!--
        Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
        It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
        Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

        Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
        work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
        Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
      -->

      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css" />

      <title>React App</title>

    </head>
    <body>
      <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <!--
        This HTML file is a template.
        If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

        You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
        The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

        To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
        To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

### 2. Initialize Flatfile

In your `App.tsx`, at minimum, you'll need to pass in the `publishableKey`.
Also, add the content here to your `index.tsx`, `tsconfig.json`,
`manifest.json`, and `config-overries.js`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx src/App.tsx
  import { Dispatch, SetStateAction, useState } from "react";
  import { ISpace, initializeFlatfile } from "@flatfile/react";
  import { workbook } from "./workbook";
  import { listener } from "./listeners/simple";

  export default function App() {
    const spaceProps: ISpace = {
      name: "Embedded Space",
      publishableKey: "pk_1234",
    };

    const [showSpace, setShowSpace] = useState(false);

    const { Space, OpenEmbed } = initializeFlatfile({
      ...spaceProps,
      sidebarConfig: {
        showSidebar: false,
      },
      closeSpace: {
        operation: "submitActionFg",
        onClose: () => setShowSpace(false),
      },
    });

    const onOpenSpace = async () => {
      setShowSpace(!showSpace);
      await OpenEmbed();
    };

    return (
      <div className="content">
        <h2>
          <code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code>
        </h2>
        <p>Embed Flatfile in just a few lines of code.</p>
        {/*Button to trigger the modal */}
        <div>
          <button className="contrast" onClick={onOpenSpace}>
            {showSpace === true ? "Close" : "Open and create new"} Space
          </button>
          {showSpace && <Space />}
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  ```js src/index.tsx
  import React from "react";
  import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
  import App from "./App";

  const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")!;

  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    rootElement
  );

      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        process: "process/browser",
        Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
      }),
    ]);
    config.ignoreWarnings = [/Failed to parse source map/];
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.(js|mjs|jsx)$/,
      enforce: "pre",
      loader: require.resolve("source-map-loader"),
      resolve: {
        fullySpecified: false,
      },
    });
    return config;
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Start your client

1. Update your package.json to include this script:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
    "test": "react-app-rewired test",
}
```

2. Now, start your front end by heading to terminal and running the following
   command.

```bash
npm run start
```

<Note>
  You'll get an alert: We're unable to detect target browsers. Would you like to
  add the defaults to your package.json? Say yes.
</Note>

3. To see that it’s running, visit: [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) (or the port it is
   running on) and you should see your page and a button. Click the button and
   see that an empty Space gets created.

<Snippet file="shared/embedded_listener_basicreact.mdx" />

### 8. Add customizations

You can stop here or you can [view our full reference](../reference/common) to
see all the ways you can customize your importer.

# Advanced
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/reference/advanced

less commonly used embedded properties

## Reusing Spaces

During the configuration of embedded Flatfile, you have the flexibility to
either reuse an existing Space or generate a new one. These properties come into
play when you're working with an already established Space.

### space

<ParamField path="space" type="{id: string, accessToken: string}" required>
  Using your secret key, you'll make a request to a server endpoint to retrieve
  an `accessToken`.
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  space: { id: string, accessToken: string },
  //additional props
};
```

## Overrides

### mountElement

<ParamField path="mountElement" type="string" default="flatfile_iFrameContainer">
  The element Flatfile will mount to. (Will create if it doesn't already exist.)
</ParamField>

```typescript src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  mountElement: "flatfile_hello",
  //additional props
};
```

### loading

<ParamField path="loading" type="ReactElement">
  A default loading state when the Space is loading. Optionally, you can
  override the default Loading component.
</ParamField>

```typescript
const LoadingComponent = () => <label>Loading data...</label>;

const flatfileOptions = {
  //additional props
  loading: <LoadingComponent />,
};
```

### exitTitle

<ParamField path="exitTitle" type="string" default="Close Window">
  The title on the dialog that appears when exiting out of Flatfile.
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  exitTitle: "",
  //additional props
};
```

### exitText

<ParamField path="exitText" type="string" default="See below">
  The text on the dialog that appears when exiting out of Flatfile.

  Default: "Are you sure you would like to close this window? This will end your
  current data import session."

  ```jsx src/client.js
  const flatfileOptions = {
    publishableKey,
    exitText: "",
    //additional props
  };
  ```
</ParamField>

### exitPrimaryButtonText

<ParamField path="exitPrimaryButtonText" type="string" default="Yes, exit">
  The text on the dialog primary button that appears when exiting out of
  Flatfile.
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  exitPrimaryButtonText: "",
  //additional props
};
```

### exitSecondaryButtonText

<ParamField path="exitPrimaryButtonText" type="string" default="No, stay">
  The text on the dialog secondary button that appears when exiting out of
  Flatfile.
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  exitSecondaryButtonText: "",
  //additional props
};
```

### errorTitle

<ParamField path="errorTitle" type="string" default="Something went wrong">
  The title on the dialog that appears when an unexpected error occurs when
  loading Flatfile. Note: the error dialog will also include error details
  regarding the error that occurred.
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  errorTitle: "",
  //additional props
};
```

### iframe styles

<Note>
  Theming within the Flatfile application is done in an event listener.
</Note>

The CSS here is for styling how you want things to look outside of the Flatfile
iframe, like the exit dialog, the error container, and the dialog wrapper. This
css can go in your `style.css` in your `public` folder. Remember to use
`!important` to override values.

<Snippet file="shared/iframeStyles.mdx" />

## On Premises

For customers hosting on-premises, the following variables apply.

### apiUrl

<ParamField path="apiUrl" type="string" default="https://platform.flatfile.com/api">
  The endpoint used to interact with the Flatfile API
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  apiUrl: "",
  //additional props
};
```

### spaceUrl

<ParamField path="spaceUrl" type="string" default="https://platform.flatfile.com/s">
  The URL for accessing the Flatfile Spaces API.
</ParamField>

```jsx src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  spaceUrl: "",
  //additional props
};
```


# Common
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/reference/common

### document

<ParamField path="document" type="object">
  Document to pass to space
</ParamField>

[Documents](/learning-center/guides/documents), written in Markdown, provide extra
clarification and instructions to users of a Space. Each Document will appear in
the sidebar of a Space. Standard syntax is supported.

<CodeGroup>

## Client-Side Server

These options are available when configuring your Space client-side.

### environmentId

<ParamField path="environmentId" type="string" required>
  Identifier for environment. This is optional with creating a Workbook
  client-side. The key includes environment-specific configurations.
</ParamField>

```typescript src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  //additional props
};
```

### workbook

<ParamField path="workbook" type="object">
  Config of the workbook to be created
</ParamField>

```typescript src/client.js
const myWorkbook = {
  // see Blueprint
};

const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  workbook: myWorkbook,
  //additional props
};
```

### listener

<ParamField path="listener" type="Listener">
  Event listener for responding to Events.
</ParamField>

```typescript src/client.js
const myListener = {
  // listener code
};

const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  listener: myListener,
  //additional props
};
```

## Configuration

These properties allow you to configure how the importer is mounted, displayed,
and closed.

### closeSpace

<ParamField path="closeSpace" type="operation: string, onClose: (data: any) => void">
  Options for when to close the iframe and a callback function when the session
  is complete.
</ParamField>

```typescript src/client.js
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  //additional props
  closeSpace: {
    operation: "submit",
    onClose: () => {},
  },
};
```

This `onClose` callback function is called when the 'operation' defined in the
Action is complete and closes the iframe. It can also be used to perform cleanup
actions, such as resetting the state of the parent application or updating the
UI.

### displayAsModal

<ParamField path="displayAsModal" type="boolean" default="true">
  Display Flatfile as a full screen modal or inline on the page.
</ParamField>

Toggling off this property will update the wrapper css to make the iframe fully
inline thereby hiding the close button. All of the child divs will no longer
include: `.flatfile_displayAsModal` which removes all the dialog styling.

The default width and height of the container can be overriden in `style.css`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript src/client.js
  const flatfileOptions = {
    publishableKey,
    displayAsModal: false,
    //additional props
  };
  ```

  ```css public/styles.css
  .flatfile_iframe-wrapper {
    min-width: 768px;
    min-height: 600px;
    width: 992px;
    height: 600px;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## sheet\[]

Configuring your sheet for Portal is telling us about the data you’re looking to
receive and in what format. You can specify things like fields being required or
unique so that some of the built-in validation can help expedite your data
import.

A sheet contains 3 elements, a `name`, `slug` and your `fields`. We go over
Fields in detail in our Blueprint guide, but in the below example, you will see
that each field has a `key`, `type` and `label`. Some keys also use the
`constraints` property to specify things like a field needing to be `required`
to have a value or be a `unique` value in the field values. You might also
notice in the below example that a field type of `enum` also using an additional
`config` property where the `options` in the enum list will be defined.

Example sheet:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.html
  const sheet = {
    name: 'Contacts',
      slug: 'contacts',
      fields: [
        {
          key: 'name',
          type: 'string',
          label: 'Name',
          constraints: [
            { type: 'required' }
          ]
        },
        {
          key: 'email',
          type: 'string',
          label: 'Email',
          constraints: [
            { type: 'required' },
            { type: 'unique' },
          ]
        },
      {
        key: 'age',
        type: 'number',
        label: 'Age',
      },
      {
        key: 'employmentStatus',
        type: 'boolean',
        label: 'Currently employed?',
      },
      {
        key: 'birthYear',
        type: 'enum',
        label: 'Birth Year',
        config: {
          options: [
            { value: '1999', label: '1999' },
            { value: '2000', label: '2000' },
            // more here
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now that we’ve built out the sheet above, we can add it to the full example
below. Notice that in addition to the above sheet being added into the script
tag, we’ve also referenced the `sheet` in the `flatfileOptions`. Quick note: The
`flatfileOptions` object does expect to get a `sheet` object with that name. So
you can name your `sheet` whatever you like, but if your sheet is
`const mySheet = {}` then you will just need your `flatfileOptions` object to
look like `sheet: mySheet` instead.

            publishableKey,
            sheet,

          }

## onRecordHook()

Now that we have configured our Sheet, we will look at the Data Validations
piece. Data Validations in the Portal setup can be written inside of the
`onRecordHook` callback of the `flatfileOptions` object. This callback will run
on each record at initialization and then on any subsequent changes of the data.

The callback you write will get the `record` passed in by default and you can
update that record with any updates you’d like to make and return it as the
output of the callback and that will update the record in the UI. For the
purposes of being super basic in this example, let’s say you like to store the
`name` property in your Database as all uppercase values. To ensure that this
happens, we can write a simple function using JavaScript’s `toUpperCase` method
to make sure all values continually get put to all uppercase values.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.html
  // taking just the flatfileOptions object out from the full example
  const flatfileOptions = {
    publishableKey,
    sheet,
    onRecordHook: (record) => {
      const name = record.get('name')
      if (name) {
        record.set('name', name.toUpperCase())
        record.addInfo('name', 'We updated the values to all uppercase')
      }
      return record
    },
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

What you’ll notice from the above is that we can use a built-in `record.get()`
method with the fields key value to initially get the record’s value. We can
then use the `record.set()` method to set the new value for the field and then
we can optionally provide some context onto the record with `record.addInfo()`
to set a message on the field.

Quick note on the additional info being added: You can add additional info on a
field with several different validation levels. You can use `addInfo` as a
courtesy to let your end use know what transformations is happening with the
data, you could use `addWarning` to provide a warning message (the main
difference between the two is how noticeable a field is after running the hook
in the UI) and finally, you can use `addError` which not only highlights
everything in red, but changes the data’s validation state to being not valid
and making the end use fix the issue.

Here’s the above added to the full code snippet:

## onSubmit()

Flatfile has many different ways to handle and process data back to you once an
import has happened, but the easiest in this context is the built-in `onSubmit`
callback where the data is provided to you. Using this callback will add a
button labelled "Submit" in the top right of your space for users to click on to
initiate the record submission process. Due to the nature of this callback and
button, it cannot be used with our
[action constraints](/learning-center/concepts/actions#optional-parameters).

This `onSubmit` callback passes in an object that has the records for you to
send wherever you might need to store them. For example purposes, we are going
to simply log the results, but this is where you could send results to your
server or pass them back to your application.

When the data is finished and available, the `onSubmit` method will provide you
with a `sheet` that you can use the built-in methods like `allData()`,
`validData()`, `errorData()`, `inChunks()` and `stream()` to get your data.
Here’s a quick reference table for the available methods and what they do.

With all those methods brought to light, let’s simply use the `allData` method
to get all the records at once and then console log them in the process.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.html
  // just working within the confines of the flatfileOptions object
  const flatfileOptions = {
    publishableKey,
    sheet,
    onRecordHook: (record) => {
      const name = record.get('name')
      if (name) {
        record.set('name', name.toUpperCase())
        record.addInfo('name', 'We updated the values to all uppercase')
      }
      return record
    },
    onSubmit: async ({sheet}) => {
      const data = await sheet.allData()
      console.log(data)
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now let’s put it all together in the full example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```html index.html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <title>Your Page Title</title>
      <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/@flatfile/javascript@latest/dist/index.js"></script>
      <script>
        window.openFlatfile = ({ publishableKey }) => {
          const sheet = {
            name: "Contacts",
            slug: "contacts",
            fields: [
              {
                key: "name",
                type: "string",
                label: "Name",
                constraints: [{ type: "required" }],
              },
              {
                key: "email",
                type: "string",
                label: "Email",
                constraints: [{ type: "required" }, { type: "unique" }],
              },
              {
                key: "age",
                type: "number",
                label: "Age",
              },
              {
                key: "employmentStatus",
                type: "boolean",
                label: "Currently employed?",
              },
              {
                key: "birthYear",
                type: "enum",
                label: "Birth Year",
                config: {
                  options: [
                    { value: "1999", label: "1999" },
                    { value: "2000", label: "2000" },
                    // more here
                  ],
                },
              },
            ],
          };
          const flatfileOptions = {
            publishableKey,
            sheet,
            onRecordHook: (record) => {
              const name = record.get("name");
              if (name) {
                record.set("name", name.toUpperCase());
                record.addInfo("name", "We updated the values to all uppercase");
              }
              return record;
            },
            onSubmit: async ({ sheet }) => {
              const data = await sheet.allData();
              console.log(data);
            },
          };
          window.FlatFileJavaScript.startFlatfile(flatfileOptions);
        };
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h3>
        We are going to import your data now. Click the button below to start your
        import
      </h3>
      <div class="container">
        <button
          id="flatfileButton"
          onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'})"
        >
          Import Contacts
        </button>
      </div>
      <br />
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The above example is a fully working example that only needs to have your
publishable key changed out for it to work as expected.

As a quick reminder, this is just the baseline of what Flatfile is capable of
doing. You can check out more resources in our
[documentation here.](https://flatfile.com/docs/overview)


# Quickstart
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/vue/new_space

create a new Space every time Flatfile is opened

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new
Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate
for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

Make a new directory.

```bash
mkdir example-flatfile-vuejs-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd example-flatfile-vuejs-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```

```bash
npm i vue @flatfile/vue @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/listener && npm i --save-dev vite @vitejs/plugin-vue vue-tsc typescript
```

### Create your file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
├── src/
   ├── App.vue
   ├── config.ts
   ├── main.ts
   ├── shims-vue.d.ts (optional if you have errors when importing App.vue)
   ├── vite-env.d.ts
   ├── styles.css (optional)
   └── listener.ts (wait to add this)
├── index.html
├── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.node.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── .env (for your keys)
├── package.json <--- already created
└── package-lock.json <--- already created
```

In this file structure, your main directory is `src`.

Depending on how you want to handle styling your application, you can have a
`styles.css` file in your src directory, create sub-directories to contain style
files, or even create directories outside of `src` if you prefer. The only
requirement is that the files can be imported into vue files.

The heart of your vue app will be `App.vue`, as this will configure and render
your component(s) to the index.html.

### Build your importer

#### 1. Add a Flatfile Button

Add a button to your application to open Flatfile in a modal. Pass in your
`publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load. Optionally,
add the content here to your `styles.css`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```HTML index.html (full page)
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Vue</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```

  ```CSS src/styles.css

    /* The description text you see in the error component */
    /* .ff_error_text {
    }*/

  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Configure your project

In your environment file, you'll need to define your keys. In this example, you
will need your `publishableKey`. You can find these under "Developer settings"
when logged into [platform.flatfile.com](https://platform.flatfile.com).

You can create your `.env` file via the template below, as well as your
`App.vue`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, and `vite.config.ts`, which
are the remaining top-level config files. After these are initialized properly
we can configure the app files under `src`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash .env
    # VITE_ is in front of these variables to make them accessible to App.vue
    VITE_ENVIRONMENT_ID = "your_environment_id"
    VITE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "your_publishable_key"
  ```

  ```JSON tsconfig.json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "module": "ESNext",
        "target": "es2016",
        "useDefineForClassFields": true,
        "lib": ["ES2020", "ESNext", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "allowJs": true,
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "incremental": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "resolveJsonModule": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.d.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.vue"],
      "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
    }
  ```

  ```JSON tsconfig.node.json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "composite": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "module": "es2015",
        "moduleResolution": "bundler",
        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
      },
      "include": ["vite.config.ts"]
    }

  ```

  ```TypeScript vite.config.ts
  import { defineConfig } from "vite";
  import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";

  // https://vitejs.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [vue()],
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Initialize Flatfile

In your `App.vue` you'll need to pass in a minimum of the `publishableKey` from
your `.env`.

Also, add the content here to your `main.ts`, and `vite-env.d.ts`. Optionally
you can also add `shims-vue.d.ts` if you have the need.

<CodeGroup>
  ```HTML src/App.vue
  <script lang="jsx">
  import { ref, defineComponent } from 'vue';
  import { initializeFlatfile } from '@flatfile/vue';


  export default defineComponent({
    setup() {
      const showSpace = ref(false);

      const spaceProps = ref({
        name: 'Vue Space',
        publishableKey: 'pk_1234',
        closeSpace: {
            operation: 'TestSheet:submit',
          onClose: () => { showSpace.value = false; },
        },
        workbook: {},
      });

      const { Space, OpenEmbed } = initializeFlatfile(spaceProps.value);

      const toggleSpace = () => {
        showSpace.value = !showSpace.value;
        OpenEmbed()
      };

      return {
        toggleSpace,
        showSpace,
        Space
      }
    },
    render(props, ctx) {
      const Space = props.Space

      return (
        <div>
          <div class="description">
            <button onClick={props.toggleSpace}>{ props.showSpace ? 'Close' : 'Open' } space</button>
          </div>

          {props.showSpace && <div class="space-wrapper">
            <Space />
          </div>}
        </div>
      )
    },
  });
  </script>

  ```

  ```TypeScript src/main.ts
  import { createApp } from "vue";
  import App from "./App.vue";

  createApp(App).mount("#app");
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/vite-env.d.ts
  /// <reference types="vite/client" />
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/shims-vue.d.ts
  declare module "*.vue";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Start your client

1. Update your package.json to include this script:

```JSON
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vue-tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
```

2. Now, start your front end by heading to the terminal and running the
   following command.

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Your console should display a message like the following:

```
> vue@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v4.5.0  ready in 215 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

3. To view your app, copy the url and paste it into your browser. Click the
   button and see that an Empty Space gets created.

### 5. Build a workbook

Now, let’s build a Workbook inside the Space for next time.

Add your `config.ts` file, and place the following code in it. After you have
done so, import the configuration to `App.vue`, and update `spaceProps` to have
the value of `config` under `workbook` (this will be around `line 36`). This
config file has the configuration settings for your workbook, so feel free to
edit however necessary to meet your needs.

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/config.ts
    import { Flatfile } from "@flatfile/api";

    export const config: Pick<
      Flatfile.CreateWorkbookConfig,
      "name" | "sheets" | "actions"
    > = {
      name: "Employees workbook",
      sheets: [
        {
          name: "TestSheet",
          slug: "TestSheet",
          fields: [
            {
              key: "first_name",
              type: "string",
              label: "First name",
              constraints: [
                {
                  type: "required",
                },
              ],
            },
            {
              key: "last_name",
              type: "string",
              label: "last name",
            },
            {
              key: "email",
              type: "string",
              label: "Email",
            },
          ],
          actions: [
            {
              label: "Join fields",
              operation: "TestSheet:join-fields",
              description: "Would you like to join fields?",
              mode: "foreground",
              confirm: true,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      actions: [
        {
          label: "Submit",
          operation: "TestSheet:submit",
          description: "Would you like to submit your workbook?",
          mode: "foreground",
          primary: true,
          confirm: true,
        },
      ],
    };

  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 6. Transform Data

Next, we'll listen for data changes and respond using an event listener.

1. Add a `src/listener.ts` file with this simple `recordHook`.
2. Update `App.tsx` to import the listener.

Once you add this code, when a change occurs, we'll log the entered first name
and update the last name to "Rock." You'll immediately see this begin to work
when you add or update any records. Learn more about
[Handling Data](/learning-center/guides/handling-data)

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/listeners/listener.ts
  import api from "@flatfile/api";
  import { FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";
  import { recordHook } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";

  /**
   * Example Listener
   */
  export const listener = FlatfileListener.create((listener) => {
    listener.on("**", (event) => {
      console.log(`Received event:`, event);
    });

    listener.use(
      recordHook("TestSheet", (record) => {
        const firstName = record.get("firstName");
        console.log({ firstName });
        record.set("lastName", "Rock");
        return record;
      })
    );

    listener.filter({ job: "workbook:TestSheet:submit" }, (configure) => {
      configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { jobId } }) => {
        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Getting started.",
            progress: 10,
          });

          // Make changes after cells in a Sheet have been updated
          console.log("Make changes here when an action is clicked");

          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              acknowledge: true,
              message: "This is now complete.",
              next: {
                type: "wait",
              },
            },
          });
        } catch (error: any) {
          console.error("Error:", error.stack);

          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: "This job encountered an error.",
            },
          });
        }
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  ```JavaScript src/App.vue
  <script lang="jsx">
  import { ref, defineComponent } from 'vue';
  import { initializeFlatfile } from '@flatfile/vue';
  import { config as workbook } from "/src/workbooks/config";
  import { listener } from '/src/listeners/listener';


  export default defineComponent({
    setup() {
      const showSpace = ref(false);

      const spaceProps = ref({
        name: 'Vue Space',
        publishableKey: 'pk_1234',
        closeSpace: {
          operation: 'submitActionFg',
          onClose: () => { showSpace.value = false; },
        },
        workbook,
        listener
      });

      const { Space, OpenEmbed } = initializeFlatfile(spaceProps.value);

      const toggleSpace = () => {
        showSpace.value = !showSpace.value;
        OpenEmbed()
      };

      return {
        toggleSpace,
        showSpace,
        Space
      }
    },
    render(props, ctx) {
      const Space = props.Space

      return (
        <div>
          <div class="description">
            <button onClick={props.toggleSpace}>{ props.showSpace ? 'Close' : 'Open' } space</button>
          </div>

          {props.showSpace && <div class="space-wrapper">
            <Space />
          </div>}
        </div>
      )
    },
  });
  </script>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 7. Match your brand

By attaching a `themeConfig` to `spaceProps` in `src/App.tsx`, we will now
override colors in your Space to match your brand. See all of the options here
in the [Theming Reference](/learning-center/guides/theming).

```typescript
themeConfig: {
  root: {
    primaryColor: "red",
    textColor: "white",
    logo: "https://images.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/gL6Blz3kTPdZXWknuIDVx/7bb7c73d93b111ed542d2ed426b42fd5/flatfile.svg",
  },
},
```

### 8. Add customizations

You can stop here or you can [view our full reference](../reference/common) to
see all the ways you can customize your importer.

# Reuseable Spaces
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/sdks/vue/reuse_space

reuse a Space when Flatfile is opened

For applications meant to use the same space consistently, open an existing
space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where consistently
editing a dataset is preferred.

## Before you begin

If you have already tried our [Embed a New Space](./new_space) guide you will
notice this guide departs heavily, so you will want to create this in a new
directory, as translation would be more difficult than creating from scratch.

<Snippet file="shared/sk_needed.mdx" />

Make a new Directory.

```bash
mkdir example-flatfile-vuejs-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd example-flatfile-vuejs-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```

Install Packages

```bash
npm i @flatfile/api @flatfile/listener @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/vue dotenv ejs express vue && npm i --save-dev @types/express @types/node @vitejs/plugin-vue concurrently nodemon ts-node typescript vite vue-tsc
```

### Create your file structure

The file structure of this application is fairly complex, as it requires a
dedicated server and API. You can create an api endpoint externally if desired
to keep your own application less complex, however this application is an
all-in-one application server and api solution.

In order to create this solution, create a file structure like the following:

```text
├── server/
   ├── assetsRouter.ts
   ├── homepageRouter.ts
   └── index.ts
├── src/
   ├── components/
       ├── ExistingSpace.vue
       ├── Home.vue
       └── NewSpace.vue <--- optional, requires listener.ts and config.ts
   ├── listeners/
       └── listener.ts <--- optional depending on if NewSpace.vue is included
   ├── styles/
       └── styles.css
   ├── workbooks/
       └── config.ts <--- optional depending on if NewSpace.vue is included
   ├── App.vue
   ├── main.ts
   ├── shims-vue.d.ts <--- may be optional
   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── views/
   └── index.html.ejs
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── nodemon.json
├── package.json <--- already created
├── package-lock.json <--- already created
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.js
```

In this file structure, you will primarily work out of `/src` especially in
`/src/components`. Many of thsese files are configuration files which are mostly
set once and not touched again. So while there may be a lot, they won't be
actively managed.

### Update your .env

Update your `.env`. `FLATFILE_API_KEY` is your Secret Key and `SPACE_ID` is the
Space you want to open in the importer. This can be found on your Dashboard
where it lists your Spaces. You may also want to include your `PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
and `ENVIRONMENT_ID` if you want to have your app create new spaces as well.

Note in the below example some of the variables are prefixed with `VITE_`. This
is because Vite requires the prefix to access them at runtime. The
`FLATFILE_API_KEY` should never be accessible from the browser for security
reasons, and should not have this prefix.

```bash
# Required for creating new spaces
VITE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "pk_12345"
VITE_ENVIRONMENT_ID  = "us_env_12345"

# Required for embedding existing spaces
VITE_SPACE_ID        = "us_sp_12345"
FLATFILE_API_KEY     = "sk_12345"
```

### Build your importer

Before starting to build the application, it is important to note that there are
a few moving parts, and it won't be able to start up between each update that is
being made. This guide will endeavor to break out files into groups, so that
after everything is updated as directed, the app should start up without errors.

#### 1. Set up Configuration Files

This app has several configuration files that must be set up before you can get
started with development. Set them up as shown below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```JavaScript vite.config.js
  import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

  // https://vitejs.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [vue()],
      build: {
        manifest: true,
        rollupOptions: {
          input: './src/main.ts',
        },
      },
  })
  ```

  ```JSON tsconfig.json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "outDir": "dist",
      "module": "es6",
      "target": "es2016",
      "lib": [
        "dom",
        "dom.iterable",
        "esnext",
        "es2020"
      ],
      "useDefineForClassFields": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "allowJs": true,
      "strict": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "incremental": true,
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "resolveJsonModule": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
      "noEmit": true,
      "isolatedModules": true,
      "jsx": "preserve",
    },
    "ts-node": {
      "esm": true,
      "experimentalSpecifierResolution": "node"
    },
    "include": [
      "**/*.ts",
      "**/*.d.ts",
      "**/*.tsx",
      "src/**/*.vue"
    ],
  }
  ```

  ```JSON nodemon.json
  {
    "watch": ["server"],
    "ext": "ts,json",
    "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
    "exec": "ts-node ./server/index.ts"
  }
  ```

  ```gitignore .gitignore
  # Logs
  logs
  *.log
  npm-debug.log*
  yarn-debug.log*
  yarn-error.log*
  pnpm-debug.log*
  lerna-debug.log*

  node_modules
  dist
  dist-ssr
  *.local

  # Editor directories and files
  .vscode/*
  !.vscode/extensions.json
  .idea
  .DS_Store
  *.suo
  *.ntvs*
  *.njsproj
  *.sln
  *.sw?

  .env
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You will also want to add some scripts to your `package.json` to start the app.
Add the following scripts:

```JSON pacakge.json (snippet)
"scripts": {
  "dev:frontend": "vite",
  "dev:backend": "nodemon",
  "dev": "concurrently 'npx tsc --watch' 'npm:dev:frontend' 'npm:dev:backend'",
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production ts-node server/index.ts",
  "build": "vite build"
},
```

Please note that these scripts include files that haven't been created yet.
These will be created in the following steps.

#### 2. Create the EJS HTML and Server

This app has a home page to route the user to create a new space or embed an
existing space. While the former choice is optional and not the focus of this
guide (although instructions on how to include this function will be included),
the files edited here set up functionality for embedding existing spaces, and as
such is still necessary.

This application utilizes ejs, which helps build dynamic html pages. This allows
us to dynamically create both development and production environment outputs
from one file. Set this up at `/views/index.html.ejs`

This file wil not work before the server is functioning, but is required for the
rest of the app to work.

```EJS views/index.html.ejs
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svgxml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Vite  Vue</title>
    <% if (environment === 'production') { %>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= manifest['src/main.css'].file %>" />
    <% } %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <% if (environment === 'production') { %>
      <script type="module" src="<%= manifest['src/main.ts'].file %>"></script>
    <% } else { %>
      <script type="module" src="http://localhost:5173/@vite/client"></script>
      <script type="module" src="http://localhost:5173/src/main.ts"></script>
    <% } %>
  </body>
</html>
```

Next lets create the server that will act as the backend of the application.
This will be necessary to serve the pages as well as get the existing space, as
due to security reasons the Secret Key cannot be exposed to the browser at any
time.

```TypeScript server/index.ts
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { FlatfileClient } from "@flatfile/api";

dotenv.config();

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const publicPath = path.join(path.resolve(), "public"); //If your project doesn't require a public path this may not be necessary
const distPath = path.join(path.resolve(), "dist");

app.get('/api/spaces/:id', async (_req, res)=>{
  const {id} = _req.params;
  const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
    token: process.env.FLATFILE_API_KEY,
    environment: 'https://platform.flatfile.com/v1/',
  });
  try {
    const space = await flatfile.spaces.get(id);
    res.json({ space });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error retrieving space:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to retrieve space" });
  }
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port", port);
});
```

In addition to the `server/index.ts`, you will need to create two routers - One
for the homepage and one for the assets. This is because the frontend runs on a
different port than you'll be accessing the app from, so the app will need a bit
of help resolving pathing.

Create `server/homepageRouter.ts` and `server/assetsRouter.ts` as follows, then
update `server/index.ts`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript server/homepageRouter.ts
  import express from "express";
  import fs from 'fs/promises';
  import path from "path";

  const router = express.Router();
  const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;

  router.get('/*', async (_req, res)=>{
    const data = {
      environment,
      manifest: await parseManifest()
    };

    res.render('index.html.ejs', data);
  });

  const parseManifest = async () => {
    if(environment !== "production") return {};

    const manifestPath = path.join(path.resolve(), 'dist', "manifest.json");
    const manifestFile = await fs.readFile(manifestPath, 'utf8');

    return JSON.parse(manifestFile);
  }

  export default router;
  ```

  ```TypeScript server/assetsRouter.ts
  import express from "express";

  const router = express.Router();

  const supportedAssets = ["svg", "png", "jpg", "png", "jpeg", "mp4", "ogv"];

  const assetExtensionRegex = () => {
    const formattedExtensionList = supportedAssets.join("|");

    return new RegExp(`/.+\.(${formattedExtensionList})$`);
  };

  router.get(assetExtensionRegex(), (req, res) => {
    res.redirect(303, `http://localhost:5173/src${req.path}`);
  });

  export default router;
  ```

  ```TypeScript server/index.ts
  import dotenv from 'dotenv';
  import express from "express";
  import path from "path";
  import assetsRouter from "./assetsRouter";
  import homepageRouter from './homepageRouter';

  import { FlatfileClient } from "@flatfile/api";

  dotenv.config();

  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
  const publicPath = path.join(path.resolve(), "public");
  const distPath = path.join(path.resolve(), "dist");

  const app = express();

  app.get('/api/spaces/:id', async (_req, res)=>{
    const {id} = _req.params;
    const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
      token: process.env.FLATFILE_API_KEY,
      environment: 'https://platform.flatfile.com/v1/',
    });
    try {
      const space = await flatfile.spaces.get(id);
      res.json({ space });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error retrieving space:", error);
      res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to retrieve space" });
    }
  })

  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    app.use("/", express.static(distPath));
  } else {
    app.use("/", express.static(publicPath));
    app.use("/src", assetsRouter);
  }

  app.use(homepageRouter);

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log("Server listening on port", port);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 3. Build the App Component

Before building the components, you'll need to make a couple TypeScript
Declaration files. This is so your IDE won't throw unnecessary errors at you
during development.

You'll need a `src/vite-env.d.ts` file and a `src/shims-vue.d.ts` file in order
to sort your the declarations. Create them as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/vite-env.d.ts
  /// <reference types="vite/client" />
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/shims-vue.d.ts
  declare module '*.vue';
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next you'll need a `src/main.ts` file to mount `src/App.vue` to your HTML.
Create it and your App Component as shown below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```TSX src/App.vue
  <template>
    <div class="main">
      <h2>
        <code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code>
      </h2>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/main.ts
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import App from './App.vue'

  createApp(App).mount('#app')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 4. Build your Home & Existing Space Component

This app is built around a Home component that is loaded first and lets you
navigate the app. That component is fairly basic and should look like this:

```TypeScript src/components/Home.vue
<template>
  <h3>Choose what you want to do!</h3>
  <div class="button-container">
    <a href="#/existing-space">Embed a Existing Space</a>
  </div>
</template>
```

Now you'll need to build the component that will get your space and return it to
the browser.

The component should end up looking something like this:

```TypeScript src/components/ExistingSpace.vue

<script lang="jsx">
import { ref, onMounted, h, defineComponent } from 'vue';
import { initializeFlatfile } from '@flatfile/vue';
import { workbook } from "./config";
import { listener } from './listener'

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const showSpace = ref(false);

    const spaceProps = ref({
      space: {
        id: 'us_sp_1234',
        accessToken: 'sk_1234',
      },
      closeSpace: {
        operation: "submitActionFg",
        onClose: () => {
          showSpace.value = false;
        },
      },
      themeConfig: {
        root: {
          primaryColor: "red",
          textColor: "white",
          logo: "https://images.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/gL6Blz3kTPdZXWknuIDVx/7bb7c73d93b111ed542d2ed426b42fd5/flatfile.svg",
        },
      },
      displayAsModal: true,
    });


    const { Space, OpenEmbed } = initializeFlatfile(spaceProps.value);

    const toggleSpace = async () => {
      showSpace.value = !showSpace.value;

      OpenEmbed();
    };

    return {
      toggleSpace,
      showSpace,
      Space
    }
  },
  render(props, ctx) {
    const Space = props.Space

    return (
      <div>
        <div class="description">
          <button onClick={props.toggleSpace}>{ props.showSpace ? 'Close' : 'Open' } space</button>
        </div>

        {props.showSpace && <div class="space-wrapper">
          <Space />
        </div>}
      </div>
    )
  },
});
</script>

```

You'll need to update your `App.vue` to include the existing space component. It
should end up looking like the example below:

```TypeScript src/App.vue
<template>
  <div class="main">
    <h2>
      <code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code>
    </h2>
    <p>Embed Flatfile in just a few lines of code.</p>
    <nav class="navbar">
      <a href="#/">Home</a>
      <a href="#/existing-space">Embed a Existing Space</a>
      <component :is="currentView" />
    </nav>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import Home from './components/Home.vue'
import ExistingSpace from './components/ExistingSpace.vue'

const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/existing-space': ExistingSpace,
}

const currentPath = ref(window.location.hash);

window.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {
  currentPath.value = window.location.hash
});

const currentView = computed(() => {
  return routes[currentPath.value.slice(1) || '/'] || NotFound
});

</script>
```

It may be wise to set up your styles in `src/styles/styles.css`. These should
end up looking like the example below:

```CSS src/styles/styles.css
/* Styles for home page */
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  background: #090b2b;
  color: #fff;
}

#app {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100%;
}

/* End of styles for home page */

:root {
  --ff-primary-color: #4c48ef !important;
  --ff-secondary-color: #616a7d !important;
  --ff-text-color: #090b2b !important;
  --ff-dialog-border-radius: 4px !important;
  --ff-border-radius: 5px !important;
  --ff-bg-fade: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) !important;
}

nav {
}

nav a {
  color: white;
  margin: 1em;
}

.button-container a {
  border: rgb(101, 201, 101) 1px solid;
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 0.5em;

Remember to add `import './styles/styles.css'` to your `src/App.vue` with the
other imports to apply the styles.

#### 5. Optional - Build your New Space Component

If you want to have a page to create new spaces, you can create a component to
do that fairly easily. The vue code should look fairly similar to Existing
Space, just with some different configuration settings. See below for the
necessary changes.

<CodeGroup>
  ```TypeScript src/components/NewSpace.vue

  <script lang="jsx">
  import { ref, defineComponent } from 'vue';
  import { initializeFlatfile } from '@flatfile/vue';
  import { config as workbook } from "/src/workbooks/config";
  import { listener } from '/src/listeners/listener';


  export default defineComponent({
    setup() {
      const showSpace = ref(false);

      const spaceProps = ref({
        name: 'Vue Space',
        publishableKey: 'pk_1234',
        closeSpace: {
          operation: 'submitActionFg',
          onClose: () => { showSpace.value = false; },
        },
        workbook,
        listener
      });

      const { Space, OpenEmbed } = initializeFlatfile(spaceProps.value);

      const toggleSpace = () => {
        showSpace.value = !showSpace.value;
        OpenEmbed()
      };

      return {
        toggleSpace,
        showSpace,
        Space
      }
    },
    render(props, ctx) {
      const Space = props.Space

      return (
        <div>
          <div class="description">
            <button onClick={props.toggleSpace}>{ props.showSpace ? 'Close' : 'Open' } space</button>
          </div>

          {props.showSpace && <div class="space-wrapper">
            <Space />
          </div>}
        </div>
      )
    },
  });
  </script>
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/App.vue
  <template>
    <div class="main">
      <h2>
        <code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code>
      </h2>
      <p>Embed Flatfile in just a few lines of code.</p>
      <nav class="navbar">
        <a href="#/">Home</a>
        <a href="#/new-space">Embed a New Space</a>
        <a href="#/existing-space">Embed a Existing Space</a>
        <component :is="currentView" />
      </nav>
    </div>
  </template>

  <script setup>
  import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
  import Home from './components/Home.vue'
  import NewSpace from './components/NewSpace.vue'
  import ExistingSpace from './components/ExistingSpace.vue'
  import './styles/styles.css'

  const routes = {
    '/': Home,
    '/new-space': NewSpace,
    '/existing-space': ExistingSpace,
  }

  const currentPath = ref(window.location.hash);

  window.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {
    currentPath.value = window.location.hash
  });

  const currentView = computed(() => {
    return routes[currentPath.value.slice(1) || '/'] || NotFound
  });
  </script>
  ```

  ```TypeScript src/components/Home.vue
  <template>
    <h3>Choose what you want to do!</h3>
    <div class="button-container">
      <a href="#/new-space">Embed a New Space</a>
      <a href="#/existing-space">Embed a Existing Space</a>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 6. Start your client

Now you should be able to start your app. To load it in dev mode and ensure
everything works proprly, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you have any errors, now is your time to fix them, otherwise - you're ready
to deploy!

#### 7. Customize

You can stop here or you can [view our full reference](../reference/common) to
see all the ways you can customize your importer.

# Apps
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/architecture/apps

the anatomy of an App

## Apps

Apps are the highest-level organizational unit in Flatfile, designed to manage and coordinate data import workflows across different environments. They serve as containers for organizing related Spaces and provide a consistent configuration that can be deployed across your development pipeline.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Development Pipeline Support" icon="check">
    * Deploy configurations from development to staging to production
    * Maintain consistent behavior across environments
    * Test and validate changes before production deployment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Template System" icon="check">
    * Create reusable templates for common import scenarios.
    * Define standard configurations that can be instantiated multiple times
    * Share best practices across implementations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Namespace Organization" icon="check">
    * Group related Spaces under a common namespace
    * Manage access control at the namespace level
    * Organize workspaces by team, department, or function
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuration Management" icon="check">
    * Define standard field mappings and validations
    * Configure data transformation rules
    * Set up automated workflows using Agents
    * Manage custom constraints and validations
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Environments
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/architecture/environments

use Environments for testing and authentication.

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

{/* prettier-ignore */}

Environments are isolated entities and are intended to be a safe place to create and
test different configurations. Environments serve as self-contained, secure domains
where diverse configurations can be created and tested. By default, a development
and a production environment are set up.

| isProd  | Name          | Description                                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *false* | `development` | Use this default environment, and it’s associated test API keys, as you build with Flatfile. |
| *true*  | `production`  | When you're ready to launch, create a new environment and swap out your keys.                |

<Note>
  The development environment does not count towards your paid credits.
</Note>

## Creating an Environment

Your `publishableKey` and `secretKey` are specific to an environment therefore
to create a new Environment, you'll have to use a personal access token.

1. Open Settings
2. Click to Personal Tokens
3. You can use the key pair in there to create an access token like:

```bash
curl -X POST https://platform.flatfile.com/v1/auth -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"clientId":"1234-1234", "secret":"1234-1234"}'
```

4. The response will include an `accessToken`. You can present that as your
   **Bearer `token`** in place of the `secretKey`.

[Or click here to create an environment in the dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard)

## Guest Authentication

Environments support two types of guest authentication:

1. `magic_link`: This method dispatches an email to your guests, which includes
   a magic link to facilitate login.
2. `shared_link`: This method transforms the Space URL into a public one,
   typically used in conjunction with embedded Flatfile.

### Additional Info

Should the `guestAuthentication` be left unspecified, both `magic_link` and
`shared_link` types are enabled by default.

It's important to note that `guestAuthentication` settings can be applied at
both Environment and Space levels. However, in case of any conflicting settings,
the authentication type set at the Space level will take precedence over the
Environment level setting. This flexibility enables customization based on
specific needs, ensuring the right balance of accessibility and security.

## Secret and publishable keys

All Accounts have two key types for each environment. Learn when to use each
type of key:

| Type            | Id                     | Description                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secret key      | `sk_23ghsyuyshs7dcrty` | **On the server-side:** Store this securely in your server-side code. Don’t expose this key in an application.          |
| Publishable key | `pk_23ghsyuyshs7dcert` | **On the client-side:** Can be publicly-accessible in your application's client-side code. Use when embedding Flatfile. |

<Warning>The publishable key only has permissions to create a Space.</Warning>


# Spaces
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/architecture/spaces

the anatomy of a Space

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Flatfile Spaces are micro-applications, each having their own database,
filestore, and auth. Use Spaces to integrate Flatfile into your data exchange
workflow, whether that happens directly in your application or as part of a
currently offline process.

## Anatomy

A Space is comprised of Workbooks, Files, Users, Documents, Themes and Metadata.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/concepts/spaces_anatomy.png" caption="The anatomy of a Space" />

### Reference

[See API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/spaces/create)

#### `Workbooks` *object*

A Space contains any number of Workbooks. Each

<Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">
  [Workbook](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks)
</Tooltip>

is a Blueprint-defined database.

<Tip>
  Add the label 'pinned' to your workbook to ensure it appears as the first
  workbook in the sidebar.
</Tip>

#### `Files` *object*

Files are uploaded directly to a Space.

#### `Users` *object*

By default, all global Admins in Flatfile have access to all Spaces.
Additionally, you can configure a Space to allow for either temporary
(`shared_link`) or named (`magic_link`) Guest Users.

#### `Documents` *object*

Documents are custom pages that are mounted on the Space and display in the
sidebar of a Space in the order of their addition to the Space.

#### `Theme` *object*

Theming of Flatfile is controlled at the Space level. A comprehensive list of
Theme options are available [here](/learning-center/guides/theming).

#### `Metadata` *object*

Spaces can be created and updated with Metadata. This could include a
company-specific identifier such as a UUID for use in API operations in the
Space.


# Workbooks
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/architecture/workbooks

the anatomy of a Workbook

<Tip>
  Workbooks can function as a module within other Apps, and soon, they will also
  be available for standalone use. We're close to launching Standalone
  Workbooks, offering more flexibility and options.
  <br /> [Learn more](https://flatfile.com/platform/workbooks/) about the
  upcoming features and capabilities.
</Tip>

## Overview

Workbooks are analogous to a database, and like a database, they are configured
with a type-strict schema. A Workbook replaces the spreadsheet template you may
share with your users today when requesting data during the data collection
phase of customer onboarding or other file-based data exchange processes. Unlike
a spreadsheet, it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct,
and import data with real-time feedback.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/quickstart/workbook.png" caption="The Flatfile Workbook" />

With Workbooks, you can:

1. Accept data from many file types beyond CSVs. (And you can write your own
   file extractors if you can't find a plugin.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any
   data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define, in code, at least one primary Action that submits the reviewed data
   to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.

***

## Anatomy

A Workbook is comprised of one or more

<Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">
  [Sheets](/learning-center/blueprint/field-types)
</Tooltip>

plus any actions you want to take on those Sheets.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/concepts/workbook_anatomy.png" caption="The anatomy of a Workbook" />

### Reference

[See API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/workbooks/create-a-workbook)

#### `Sheets` *array*

A schema contains Sheets. Like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet,
Sheets isolate different data schemas.

[Learn more about Blueprint](/learning-center/blueprint/about)

#### `Fields` *array*

Sheets contain

<Tooltip tip="Describes an attribute of the entity...">
  [Fields](/learning-center/blueprint/field-types)
</Tooltip>

. Fields are defined properties of your schema (eg a first\_name on a contact
sheet.)

[Learn more about Blueprint](/learning-center/blueprint/about)

#### `Actions` *array*

Workbooks and Sheets can also contain Actions. Actions are developer-defined
operations or macros invoked by end users on selected data like Submit to API,
Download as PDF.

[Learn more about Actions](/learning-center/concepts/actions)

#### `Settings` *object*

`trackChanges: true`: Disables actions on Sheet and Workbook when there is a
commit that has not been completed (often when Hooks are running)

`noMappingRedirect: true`: When the user drags a file into a Sheet in this
Workbook, usually the user is redirected to the Mapping step. This setting
prevents that redirect. This is especially useful when you are using the
[automap plugin](/learning-center/guides/automap).

[Learn more about Blueprint](/learning-center/blueprint/about)

#### `Labels` *array*

To have a workbook appear first in the sidebar, give it the label `pinned` (it
will even have a pin icon!). You can also add other custom labels to your
workbooks as needed.


# Blueprint
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/blueprint/about

define your data schema

Blueprint is your guide to structuring data in Flatfile. It defines how your
data should look, behave, and connect—from simple field validations to complex
relationships between datasets. Think of it as a smart schema that helps you
collect exactly the data you need, in exactly the format you want it.

# Access
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/blueprint/access

control user interactions with your data

# Sheet level access

<ParamField path="access" type="array" default="*" optional>
  With `access` you can control Sheet-level access for users.
</ParamField>

### `"*"` *(default)*

A user can use all access actions to this Sheet

<Warning>
  Warning: If you use `"*"` access control, users will gain new functionalities
  as we expand access controls. Use an exhaustive list today to block future
  functionality from being added automatically.
</Warning>

### `"add"`

A user can add a record(s) to the Sheet

### `"delete"`

A user can delete record(s) from the Sheet

### `"edit"`

A user can edit records (field values) in the Sheet

### `"import"`

A user can import CSVs to this Sheet

### `<empty>`

If no parameters are specified in the access array, sheet-level readOnly access
will be applied. No data can be added, edited, imported, or removed.

```json
{
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "access": ["add", "edit"]
      // Define fields
    }
  ]
}
```

# Field-level access

### `readonly`

On a field level you can restrict a user's interaction with the data to
`readonly`. This feature is useful if you're inviting others to view uploaded
data, but do not want to allow them to edit that field. See the example in
context below:

```json
"fields": [
  {
    "key": "salary",
    "type": "number",
    "config": {
        "decimal_places": 2
    },
    "readonly": true
  }
]
```


# Constraints
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/blueprint/constraints

system level validation rules

## Field-Level

Field-level constraints allow you to indicate additional validations that will
be applied to fields of a Sheet. These constraints are in addition to the
implicit constraints based on types of data. (eg: String, Number)

For example, a value is required for every record (RequiredConstraint), or every
record must contain a unique value for the field (UniqueConstraint).

### Required

Required Constraints indicate that the given field **must** be provided with a
non-null value.

<Note>A `null` value in this case constitutes an empty cell.</Note>

```json
// within the context of a create Workbook API call
 "fields": [
  {
    "key": "firstName",
    "type": "string",
    "label": "First Name",
    "constraints": [
      {
        "type": "required"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Unique

Unique Constraints indicate that the given field value must only appear **once**
in all the values for that field.

<Note>
  `null` values will appear many times because they are not considered unique as
  there is no value to compare.
</Note>

```json
// within the context of a create Workbook API call
 "fields": [
  {
    "key": "internalCustomerId",
    "type": "number",
    "label": "Internal Customer Id",
    "constraints": [
      {
        "type": "unique"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Computed

The computed constraint hides the given field from the mapping process, so your
users will not be able to map incoming columns to this field.

```json
// within the context of a create Workbook API call
 "fields": [
  {
    key: 'age',
    type: 'number',
    label: 'Age',
    description: "The number of years since the person's birth date",
    constraints: [
      {
        type: 'computed',
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

## Sheet-Level

### Composite Uniqueness

Composite Uniqueness is a feature where a combination of two or more fields must
be unique across an entire Sheet.

To implement composite uniqueness, add the following parameters to the
`constraints` property:

* `name` *defines the name of the constraint*

* `fields` *array of field keys to consider*

* `type` *defines the type of the constraint*

* `strategy` *defines how to determine uniqueness* {" "} Can either be: {" "}
  `concat` *concatenates values from each field defined inside the `fields`
  array* {" "} or `hash` *creates a sha1 hash using of the values of each field*

```json
"sheets": [
  {
    "name": "Products",
    "description": "A list of products available for sale",
    "slug": "products",
    "constraints": [
      {
        "name": "constraint name",
        "fields": ["field_key_one", "field_key_two"],
        "type": "unique",
        "strategy": "concat"
      }
    ],
  }
]

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" required>
  One of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `enum`, `reference`. Defines the
  handling of this property. See [Field Types](./field-types) for more
  information.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="label" default="key" type="string">
  A user-facing descriptive label designed to be displayed in the UI such as a

# Field Types
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/blueprint/field-types

supported field types

## `string` *(default)*

A property that should be stored and read as a basic string.

```json
{
  "key": "currency",
  "label": "Product Code",
  "type": "string"
},
```

## `number`

A property that should be stored and read as either an integer or floating point
number. Database engines should look at the configuration to determine ideal
storage format.

<ParamField path="config.decimal_places" default="0" type="number">
  The number of decimal places to preserve accuracy to. Overages should be
  automatically rounded with a warning. A hook can pre-format to accomplish
  floor or ceiling.
</ParamField>

```json
  {
    "key": "price",
    "label": "Retail Price",
    "type": "number",
    "config": {
      "decimal_places": 2
    }
  },
```

## `reference`

Defines a reference to another sheet. Links should be established automatically
by the matching engine or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar
columns between datasets.

<ParamField path="config.ref" required>
  The full path reference to another sheet/table configuration. Must be in the
  same workbook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config.relationship" required>
  The type of relationship this defines. Can be `has-one`
</ParamField>

## `enum`

Defines an enumerated list of options for the user to select from. Matching
tooling attempts to resolve incoming data assignment to a valid option. The
maximum number of options for this list is `100`. For larger lists, users should
use the `reference` or future `lookup` types.

<ParamField path="config.allow_custom" default="false" type="boolean">
  Permit the user to create new options for this specific field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config.sortBy" default="label" type="string">
  The field to sort the options by (label, value, ordinal)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config.options" required>
  An array of valid options the user can select from
</ParamField>

<Expandable title="options" type="array" defaultOpen={true}>
  <ParamField path="value" required>
    The value or ID of this option. This value will be sent in egress
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="label" default="value" type="string">
    A visual label for this option, defaults to value if not provided
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="meta" type="object">
    An arbitrary JSON object to be associated with this option and made available to hooks
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="ordinal" type="number">
    The ordinal position of this option in the list. Only used if `sortBy` is set to `ordinal`. Options are sorted in ascending order.
  </ParamField>
</Expandable>

```json
{
  "key": "status",
  "label": "Status",
  "type": "enum",
  "config": {
    "options": [
      {
        "value": "active"
      },
      {
        "value": "inactive",
        "label": "Disabled",
        "meta": {
          "foo": "bar"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
},
```

## `boolean`

A `true` or `false` value type. Matching engines should attempt to resolve all
common ways of representing this value and it should usually be displayed as a
checkbox.

```json
{
  "key": "is_active",
  "label": "Active",
  "type": "boolean"
}
```

## `date`

Store a field as a GMT date. Data hooks must convert this value into a
`YYYY-MM-DD` format in order for it to be considered a valid value. Datetime is
not currently available, but will be a separately supported Field Type in the
future, and will include timezone.


# Relationships
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/blueprint/relationships

referencing data in other Sheets

The relationship defines a reference to another Sheet, similar to a Foreign Key.
Links should be established automatically by the mapping engine (the logic that
creates a mapping plan automatically when a user maps their data into a
workbook) or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar columns between
datasets.

## Options

* **ref** - Full path reference to another Sheet/table configuration. Must be in
  the same Workbook
* **relationship** - The type of relationship this defines. Currently, only
  `has-one` is supported

## Inheritance

This example introduces two fields linked by a relationship, inheriting the
respective email addresses of the father and mother from another Sheet.

```json workbooks.create
// in the context of create Workbook API call
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "father",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "mother",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Lookups

This example mimics a vlookup operation by fetching a value from a linked record
and applying it to a designated field in the original record.

The linked record is designated by a reference field in the original record, and
the sought-after value is defined by a lookup field in the linked record.

When a lookup value is located, it's placed into the original record's target
field. Furthermore, a message is added to the record, detailing the origin of
the retrieved value.

<ParamField path="record" type="Object">
  The record to perform the vlookup on.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="referenceFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the reference field on the original record that links to the
  linked record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lookupFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the field on the linked record that contains the value to be
  looked up.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="targetFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the field on the original record that the lookup value should be
  set to.
</ParamField>

```jsx
// in the context of listener.use(recordHook){}
export const vlookup = (
  record,
  referenceFieldKey,
  lookupFieldKey,
  targetFieldKey,
) => {
  console.log("Initial Record: " + JSON.stringify(record));
  const links = record.getLinks(referenceFieldKey);
  console.log("Linked Record: " + JSON.stringify(links));
  const lookupValue = links?.[0]?.[lookupFieldKey];
  console.log(
    "Reference Fields Key: " +
      referenceFieldKey +
      " : " +
      "LookUpValue: " +
      lookupValue,
  );

  if (isNotNil(lookupValue)) {
    record.set(targetFieldKey, lookupValue);
    record.addInfo(
      targetFieldKey,
      `${targetFieldKey} set based on ${referenceFieldKey}.`,
    );
  }
};
```

# Actions
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/concepts/actions

The anatomy of Actions

An Action is a code-based operation that runs where that Action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile. Additional Actions can be mounted on a Sheet, a Workbook, or a file by a developer.

## Types of Actions

### Built-in Actions

Workbooks, Sheets and files come with five default built-in actions:

1. Mapping data from one workbook to another (moving data from a workbook to a Workbook)
2. Deleting data from a Workbook (or the entire file)
3. Exporting (downloading) data from a Workbook (or a file)
4. Find and Replacing data in a Sheet
5. Applying a Mutate function to data in a Sheet

When these built-in actions are clicked, they create Jobs. You can listen for these events and take appropriate actions if required. Learn more about [Jobs](/learning-center/concepts/jobs).

### Developer-Created Actions

Additional Actions can be mounted on a Sheet, a Workbook, or a file. When an action is clicked, it will create a job `operation` on the `domain` it is mounted.

For example, an Action with the property `operation: 'my-action'` placed on a Workbook would spawn a job called: `workbook:my-action`. This is the job you'd listen for to respond accordingly.

## The Anatomy of an Action

### Required Parameters

All Actions contain the the information needed to let a user run the Action. This includes:

<ParamField path="operation" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the Action that is used by the listener to determine
  what work to do as part of the resulting Job.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="label" type="string" required>
  The text that will be displayed to the user in the UI as a button or menu
  item.
</ParamField>

### Optional Parameters

Optionally, an Action can also contain extra details about how it appears in the
UI. These include:

<ParamField path="primary" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether the Action is a primary Action for the resource. Depending on the
  resource, primary Actions are displayed in the UI in a more prominent way.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="confirm" type="boolean" default="true">
  When set to true, a modal is shown to confirm the Action.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  The text that will be displayed to the user when a confirmation modal is used.
  Phrase this as a question.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="icon" type="string">
  The icon to be displayed. Default is a lightning bolt. If you want to omit the
  icon, use `'none'`. All available icons are listed here: [Flatfile
  icons](/reference/icons). If the `label` is empty, then an icon will always
  be displayed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tooltip" type="string">
  Setting this will display text in the UI for both buttons and list items as a
  tooltip on hover.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="messages" type="array[{}]">
  Setting this will display text on disabled actions \[based on the state of the action] in the UI for
  both buttons and list items as a tooltip on hover.

  `[{ type: 'error' }]`

  `[{ type: 'info' }]`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="constraints" type="array[{}]">
  `[{ type: 'hasAllValid' }]`: Adding this constraint will disable a Sheet or Workbook Action when there are invalid
  records.

  `[{ type: 'hasSelection' }]`: Adding this constraint will disable a Sheet or Workbook Action when no records are selected.

  `[{ type: 'hasData' }]`: Adding this constraint will disable a Sheet or Workbook Action when there are no records.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="mode" type="string" default="background">
  Can be `foreground`, `background` or `toolbarBlocking`. Foreground mode will
  prevent interacting with the entire resource until complete. toolbarBlocking
  disables the sheet-level toolbar and Column Header menus, while still allowing
  users to enter records manually.
</ParamField>

### Usage

An Action with all of the above properties would look like this:

```js
{
  operation: 'my-action',
  label: 'My Action',
  primary: true,
  confirm: true,
  description: 'Are you sure you want to run this action?',
  constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }, { type: 'hasSelection' }],
  mode: 'foreground'
  tooltip: 'Click to run action'
}
```

## inputForm

When initiating an action, there may be instances where additional information is required from the end user to successfully complete the intended task. For example, you might want to enable users to specify the name of the file they intend to export.

In such cases, if you configure input fields for your action, a secondary dialog will be presented to the end user, prompting them to provide the necessary information. Once the user has entered the required details, they can proceed with the action seamlessly

<ParamField path="inputForm" type="object">
  An object representing the input form configuration for the action.
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  The type of the input form. Accepts: `simple`
</ResponseField>

### fields

<ResponseField name="fields" type="array[object]">
  An array of field objects representing the input form fields.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
  The key for the field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="label" type="string" required>
  The label for the field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  The type of the field. Accepts: `string` | `textarea` | `number` | `boolean` | `enum`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="defaultValue" type="string">
  The default value for the field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A description of the field.
</ResponseField>

#### config

<ResponseField name="config" type="array[object]">
  An object containing configuration options for the field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="options" type="array" required>
  An array of options for the field, each represented as an object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" type="string" required>
  The value or ID of the option.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="label" type="string">
  A visual label for the option.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A short description of the option.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  An arbitrary JSON object associated with the option.
</ResponseField>

#### constraints

<ResponseField name="constraints" type="array[object]">
  An array of constraints for the field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  The type of constraint.  Accepts: `required`
</ResponseField>

### Usage

An Action that requests input from the end user using `inputForm` would look like this. Your listener would then grab this data from the Job and take action on it. Learn more about [Using Actions with Inputs](/learning-center/guides/actions#actions-with-input-forms).

# Events
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/concepts/events

The anatomy of Events.

The Flatfile platform encompasses a comprehensive suite of tools. Firstly, it offers a REST API, which can be accessed through the <Tooltip tip="View API reference">[REST API](https://reference.flatfile.com/)</Tooltip>, empowering users to effortlessly manipulate resources. Additionally, an Event bus is available for seamless subscription to resource-related notifications.

To simplify the process of utilizing the Flatfile API, the Flatfile PubSub Client serves as a lightweight wrapper. It enables developers to seamlessly trigger API calls upon receiving Events from any PubSub driver, thus ensuring a smooth and streamlined integration process.

#### The anatomy of an Event

Flatfile Events adhere to a standardized structure, and Event listeners have the flexibility to handle Events within Flatfile using any of the following syntaxes.

[See API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/events/create-an-event)

### Using Events

Once an Event is received, it is routed to any awaiting listeners which are added with `addEventListener()` or its alias `on()`.

An Event context is passed to an **EventFilter**

```typescript
export type EventFilter = Record<string, Arrayable<string>>;

// example event context
{
  context: {
    "accountId": "us_acc_1234",
    "environmentId": "us_env_1234",
    "actorId": "us_ag_1234"
  }
}
```

#### Building with events

By leveraging the robust capabilities of our @flatfile/listener library, we can seamlessly intercept any Event and execute a callback function based on the values encapsulated within the Event itself.

```typescript
listener.on(
  "job:ready",
  { job: "space:configure" },
  async (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
    //do something here
  }
);
```

## Event Topics

Utilize the reference provided by the response of each Event topic to determine the desired
outcome or plan subsequent actions accordingly.

# Jobs
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/concepts/jobs

The anatomy of Jobs

In Flatfile, a Job represents a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource
such as a file, <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks)</Tooltip>,
or <Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">[Sheet](/learning-center/blueprint/about#terms)</Tooltip>.
The Jobs workflow provides visibility into the status and progress of your Jobs,
allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot the data processing pipeline.

## Types of Jobs

Jobs can be triggered in a number of ways, most commonly in response to user activity.
Jobs are then managed via [Listeners](/learning-center/concepts/listeners), which receive [Events](/learning-center/concepts/events) published by Flatfile in response to activity.

There are three types of Jobs on the Flatfile Platform:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Action Jobs" icon="bolt" href="/learning-center/concepts/jobs#action-based-jobs">
    Attached to custom actions
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom Jobs" icon="code" href="/learning-center/concepts/jobs#custom-jobs">
    Created dynamically in your listener
  </Card>

  <Card title="System Jobs" icon="gears" href="/learning-center/concepts/jobs#system-jobs">
    Flatfile system jobs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Action Based Jobs

Actions are developer-defined operations that can be mounted on a number of domains (including Sheets, Workbooks, Documents, and Files).
Mounting an Action means attaching a custom operation to that domain.
That operation can then be triggered by a user event (clicking a button or selecting a menu item).

<Note>
  When an Action is triggered a `job:ready` Event for a Job named
  `[domain]:[operation]` is published. Your [Listener](/learning-center/concepts/listeners)
  can then be configured to respond to that Action via it's Event.
</Note>

To run an Action based job, two configurations are necessary.

First, create an [Action](/learning-center/concepts/actions) on a domain. Here's an example of a Workbook containing an Action:

```jsx javascript
api.workbook.create({
  name: "October Report Workbook",
  actions: [
    {
      label: "Export Data",
      description: "Send data to destination system",
      operation: "export",
      type: "file",
    },
  ],
});
```

Then, create a [Listener](/learning-center/concepts/listeners) to respond to the Action:

```jsx javascript
listener.on(
  "job:ready",
  { job: "workbook:export" },
  ({ context: { jobId } }, payload) => {
    const { jobId } = event.context;

    try {
        await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
          info: "Starting submit job...",
          progress: 10,
        });

        // Custom code here

        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            message: "Submit Job was completed succesfully.",
          },
        });

    } catch (error) {
        await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            message: "This Job failed.",
          },
        });
    }
  }
);
```

Note that the Listener is listening for the `job:ready` event, for the `workbook:export` Job, which was defined in our Workbook.

### Custom Jobs

Another trigger option is to create a Custom Job via SDK/API. In the SDK, Jobs are created by calling the `api.jobs.create()` method.

Creating a custom Job in your Listener enables any Event to trigger a Job.

Here's an example of creating a custom Job in a Listener:

```jsx javascript
listener.on(
  "commit:created",
  { sheet: "contacts" },
  async ({ context: { workbookId, sheetId } }) => {
    const { data } = await api.jobs.create({
      type: "workbook",
      operation: "myCustomOperation",
      trigger: "immediate",
      source: workbookId
    });
  }
);
```

Note that the trigger for this Listener is set to immediate, which means that the Job will be created and executed immediately upon the Event firing.

Therefore, we should have our Listener ready to respond to this Job:

```jsx javascript
listener.on(
  "job:ready",
  { job: "workbook:myCustomOperation" },
  async ({ context: { jobId, workbookId }, payload }) => {
    try {
      await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
        info: "Starting my custom operation.",
        progress: 10,
      });

      // Custom code here.

      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message: "Sucessfully completed my custom operation.",
        },
      });
    } catch {
      await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message: "Custom operation failed.",
        },
      });
    }
  }
);
```

<Warning>
  Please note that Flatfile does not support Job plans for custom Actions.
</Warning>

### System Jobs

Internally, Flatfile uses Jobs to power many of the features of the Flatfile Platform, such as extraction, record mutation, and AI Assist.
Here are some examples of Jobs that the Flatfile Platform creates and manages on your behalf:

| Job Name        | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Extract`       | Extracts data from the specified source.                      |
| `Map`           | Maps data from it's ingress format to Blueprint fields.       |
| `DeleteRecords` | Deletes records from a dataset based on specified criteria.   |
| `Export`        | Exports data to a specified format or destination.            |
| `MutateRecords` | Alters records in a dataset according to defined rules.       |
| `Configure`     | Sets up or modifies the configuration of a Space.             |
| `AiAssist`      | Utilizes AI to assist with tasks such as data categorization. |
| `FindReplace`   | Searches for specific values and replaces them.               |

<Note>
  The`space:configure` Job is the only system-level Job published for developer
  consumption. This is a special Job that allows developers to configure their
  Spaces dynamically. See our [Space
  Configuration](/learning-center/guides/dynamic-configurations) documentation for more
  information.
</Note>

## The Anatomy of a Job

### Lifecycle Events

Jobs fire the following Events during their lifecycle. In chronological order, the Job Events are:

| Event                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `job:created`                   | Fires when a Job is created, but before it does anything.                                                                                                                          |
| `job:ready`                     | Fires when a Job is ready to move into the execution stage, but before it does anything.                                                                                           |
| `job:updated`                   | Fires when there is an update to a Job while it is executing.                                                                                                                      |
| `job:completed` OR `job:failed` | `job:completed` fires when a Job is completed successfully, `job:failed` fires if a Job is completed but fails. One of these events will fire upon Job completion, but never both. |
| `job:outcome-acknowledged`      | Fires when a user acknowledges the completion of a Job through a UI popup.                                                                                                         |

You can listen on any of these events in your [Listener](/learning-center/concepts/listeners), but the most common event to listen for is `job:ready`.

## Working with Jobs

Jobs can be managed via SDK/API. For a complete list of ways to interact with Jobs please see our [API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com) . Commonly, Jobs are acknowledged, progressed, and then completed, or failed. Here's look at those steps.

<Note>
  You can also use the [JobHandler Plugin](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-job-handler/) which
  simplifies the handling of Flatfile Jobs. This plugin works by listening to
  the `job:ready` event and executing the handler callback. There is an optional
  tick function which updates the Job's progress.
</Note>

### Jobs.Ack

First, acknowledge a Job. This will update the Job's status to `executing`.

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
  info: "Starting submit job...",
  progress: 10,
});
```

### Jobs.Update

Once a Job is acknowledged, you can begin running your custom operation. Jobs were designed to handle large processing loads, but you can easily update your user by updating the Job with a progress value.

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.update(jobId, {
  progress: 50,
  estimatedCompletionAt: new Date("Tue Aug 23 2023 16:19:42 GMT-0700"),
});
```

`Progress` is a numerical or percentage value indicating the completion status of the work.
You may also provide an `estimatedCompletionAt` value which will display your estimate of the remaining processing time in the foreground Job overlay.
Additionally, the Jobs Panel will share visibility into the estimated remaining time for acknowledged jobs.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/jobs/estimatedtime_actions.png" caption="estimated time" />

Finally, when your Job is complete, update the Job's status to `complete`. This status update includes an optional outcome message which will be displayed to the user.
Use this to provide detail on the outcome of the Job.

### Jobs.Complete

Once a job is complete, you can display an alert to the end user using `outcome`.

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was completed succesfully. ${myData.length} records were processed.`,
    acknowledge: true,
  },
});
```

#### Outcome.Next

Optionally, you can add a button to the outcome dialog to control the next step in the workflow once job has finished.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/jobs/goto_google.png" caption="go to google" />

##### Internal Link

Add a button to the dialog that will redirect the user somewhere within a Space using `next > Id`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "See all downloads" with this path: `space/us_sp_1234/files?mode=export`

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was completed succesfully. ${myData.length} records were processed.`,
    acknowledge: true,
    //Reference: https://platform.flatfile.com/space/{$id}/{path}?{$query}
    next: {
      type: "id",
      id: "dev_sp_1234",
      path: "files",
      query: "mode=export",
      label: "See all downloads",
    },
  },
});
```

##### External Url

Add a button to the dialog that will redirect the user to an external link using `next > Url`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "Go to Google". It will open in a new tab.

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was completed succesfully. ${myData.length} records were processed.`,
    acknowledge: true,
    next: {
      type: "url",
      url: "http://www.google.com",
      label: "Go to Google",
    },
  },
});
```

##### Download

Add a button to the dialog that will redirect the user to an external link using `next > Url`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "Download this file".

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was completed succesfully. ${myData.length} records were processed.`,
    acknowledge: true,
    next: {
      type: "download",
      fileName: "DownloadedFromFlatfile.csv",
      url: "source_of_file.csv",
      label: "Download this file",
    },
  },
});
```

##### Snapshot

Add a button to the dialog that will redirect the user a particular snapshot using `next > snapshot`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "Go to Snapshot".

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was completed succesfully.`,
    acknowledge: true,
    next: {
      type: "snapshot",
      label: "Go to Snapshot",
      snapshotId: ${snapshot.id},
      sheetId: ${sheet.id}
    },
  },
});
```

##### Files

Download files hosted on Flatfile by using `next > files`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "Download files".

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `The files should download automatically`,
    next: {
      type: "files",
      label: "Download files",
      files: [{fileId: "us_fl_123"}],
    },
  },
});
```

##### View

Dynamically update the columns visible in a sheet by using `next > view`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "Hide columns".

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was completed on sheet ${sheet.name}`,
    acknowledge: true,
    next: {
      type: "view",
      label: "Hide columns",
      sheetId: ${sheet.id},
      hiddenColumns: ['age', 'phone', 'middleName'] //a list of field keys on the sheet
    },
  },
});
```

##### Retry

Often in the event of a failure, you may want to add a button to the dialog that will retry the Job using `next > Retry`.

In this code below, we will create a button that says "Retry".

```jsx javascript
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    message: `Operation was not completed succesfully. No records were processed.`,
    acknowledge: true,
    next: {
      type: "retry",
      label: "Try again",
    },
  },
});
```


# Listeners
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/concepts/listeners

The anatomy of Listeners

## What is a Listener?

Listeners are the core of the Flatfile Platform. All of your configurations,
from [data transformations](https://flatfile.com/plugins/category/transform), to
[custom styling](/learning-center/guides/theming), to [data export](/learning-center/guides/egress) are done in
a Listener. They hold the logic backing your Flatfile Spaces, defining the
functionality of your implementation.

Fundamentally, a Listener is a function that listens for
[Events](/learning-center/concepts/events) and takes action when they occur. This means
your configurations are implemented in response to events. To understand how to
configure a Listener, it's important to understand the anatomy of an Event.

## An Event-Driven System

Flatfile is an event-driven system, meaning interactions with Flatfile (clicking
a button, editing a record, uploading a file, etc) trigger the publication of an
[Event](/learning-center/concepts/events).

Each Event contains information about its source and execution context including
a domain, topic, context, and optionally, a payload.

| Component          | Description                                       | Example                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Domain             | the jurisdiction of the event                     | record, sheet, workbook, space, file, job, agent                   |
| Topic              | a combination of a domain and an action           | `workbook:created` `workbook:updated` `workbook:deleted`           |
| Context            | detailed information about context of the event   | <pre>`{ spaceId: "us_sp_1234", fileId: "us_fl_1234", ... }`</pre>  |
| Payload (optional) | detailed information about execution of the event | <pre>`{ status: "complete", workbookId: "us_wb_1234", ... }`</pre> |

# Anatomy of a Listener

A Listener is a function designed to receive Events as they occur and take
action by executing a callback function. For example, when a file is uploaded, a
Listener can [extract](https://flatfile.com/plugins/category/extractors) its
data to a target sheet, or when a record is created, a Listener can
[validate](/learning-center/guides/handling-data) the data.

The callback function can be as simple as logging the event or as advanced as
integrating with external systems. Here is an example that logs the topic of any
incoming event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  export default function (listener) {
    listener.on("**", (event) => {
      console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
    });
  }
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  import { FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";

  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener: FlatfileListener) {
    listener.on("**", (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This function is listening on "\*\*", which is a wildcard that matches all
events. For a complete list of events that can be listened to, see
[Event Topics](/learning-center/concepts/events#event-topics).

### Filtering

Listeners may be notified of every event on your Environment, but the Events
that a Listener responds to are configurable. You can target which events your
code responds to in a few ways.

One way is to use a filter. A filter is a string that matches the topic of an
event. For example, the filter "commit:created" will match any event of that
topic.

A simple way to filter events is to use the shorthand syntax `listener.on`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  listener.on("commit:created", { sheet: "contacts" }, async (event) => {
    // Custom action responding to the commit
  });
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  listener.on(
    "commit:created",
    { sheet: "contacts" },
    async (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      // Custom action responding to the commit
    }
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This is equivalent to:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  listener.filter({ sheet: "contacts" }).on("commit:created", async (event) => {
    // Custom action responding to the commit
  });
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  listener
    .filter({ sheet: "contacts" })
    .on("commit:created", async (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      // Custom action responding to the commit
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For cases when you want to use multiple listeners under one filter, this syntax
may be useful:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener) {
    listener.filter({ sheet: "contacts" }, (configure) => {
      configure.on("commit:created", async (event) => {
        // Custom action responding to the commit
      })
    })
  });
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener: FlatfileListener) {
    listener.filter({ sheet: "contacts" }, (configure) => {
      configure.on("commit:created", async (event) => {
        // Custom action responding to the commit
      })
    })
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Namespaces

Namespaces are another way to organize Listener configurations and target
specific Events. If you have two different workflows, for example, you can
assign them to different namespaces to keep them separate.

To configure a listener to only act on events for a given namespace, simply use
the `listener.namespace` method.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  listener.namespace(['space:green'], (listener) => { ... })
  listener.namespace(['space:red'], (listener) => { ... })
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  listener.namespace(['space:green'], (listener: FlatfileListener) => { ... })
  listener.namespace(['space:red'], (listener: FlatfileListener) => { ... })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will scope the listener to only respond to events that match the namespace.

Learn more about namespaces in the [Namespaces](/learning-center/guides/namespaces) guide.

### Listener Types

Listeners can be hosted everywhere from your local machine to Flatfile's secure
cloud. The location of your listener determines the type of listener it is.

| Listener    | Location              | Description                          |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| development | developer machine     | local listener for development       |
| client-side | user machine          | browser embedded listener            |
| Agent       | Flatfile secure cloud | Flatfile hosted server-side listener |
| server-side | your secure server    | self-hosted server-side listener     |

Flatfile Listeners can be either client-side or server-side.

Client-side listeners run in the end user's web browser and respond to user
interactions. Client-side listeners are perfect for scenarios that need to tap
into values available in the browser, such as the current user's session or the
current page URL.

Server-side listeners run where deployed, either on your own servers or on
Flatfile's secure cloud, and can perform more complex tasks like running
intensive calculations or using secured credentials to integrate with external
systems.

Server-side listeners can leverage packages that need the capabilities of a
server environment.

## Agent

In Flatfile, an Agent refers to a server-side listener bundled and deployed to
Flatfile to be hosted in our secure cloud. You may deploy multiple Agents to a
single Environment, each with its own configurations and codebase. But be
careful, as multiple Agents can interfere with each other if not properly
managed.

### Managing Multiple Agents

With the capability to deploy multiple Agents within the same Environment, it is
crucial to manage them carefully to avoid race conditions and conflicts. When
multiple Agents are listening to the same event topics, they can interfere with
each other, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

### Strategies for Conflict Avoidance

1. **Event Filtering:** Ensure each Agent is configured to listen for specific
   events or topics. Properly defining the scope of events an Agent should
   handle can prevent overlap and reduce the chance of race conditions.

2. **Use of Namespaces:** Utilize namespaces to segment the operational scope of
   each Agent. This method ensures that Agents only respond to Events within
   their designated namespaces, effectively isolating their operations and
   minimizing conflict.

3. **Unique Topic Handling:** Design Agents so that no two Agents act on the
   same event topic without coordination. Establish protocols for event handling
   that specify which Agent should handle particular events or topics.

### Agent Configuration

When deploying an Agent, the CLI will automatically reduce the topic scope your
Agent listens to by examining your listener code and registering itself to
listen to only the topics your listener is configured to act on.

For example if your listener code only listens to `commit:created` events, the
CLI will automatically configure the Agent to only listen to `commit:created`
events. If your listener has a wildcard listener `**`, the CLI will configure
the Agent to listen to all events.

### Agent Deployment

To deploy an Agent, run the following command in your terminal from the root
directory containing your entry file:

```bash
npx flatfile@latest deploy
```

Please note that the -s flag can be used to give your Agent a unique slug. This
slug is useful when managing multiple Agents in the same Environment.

If no slug is provided and you already have a single Agent deployed, your Agent
will be updated and given a slug of `default`.

If more than one Agent is deployed to the same environment and no slug is
provided the CLI will prompt you to select which Agent you would like to update.

Please see [Deploying to Flatfile](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/deploy) for more
information on deploying an Agent.

## Agent Logs

When using Flatfile's secure cloud to host your listener, you can view the
executions of your Agent in the "Event Logs" tab of your dashboard. **Note:** If
you are running your Agent locally using the `develop` command to test, these
logs will not be recorded in your dashboard.

Event logs are useful in monitoring and troubleshooting your listener. Each
execution of your agent is recorded here, including any custom console logs you
have configured in your listener code.

### Failures

Failures occur when an Agent fails to execute properly. That means either an
uncaught error is thrown, or the execution times out.

If you are catching and handling errors within your code, those executions will
not be marked as failures. If you would prefer to see them marked this way,
re-throw your error after handling to bubble it up to the execution handler.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  export default function (listener) {
    listener.on("**", (event) => {
      try {
        // do something
      } catch (error) {
        // handle error
        throw error; // re-throw error to mark execution as failure
      }
    });
  }
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  export default function (listener) {
    listener.on("**", (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      try {
        // do something
      } catch (error) {
        // handle error
        throw error; // re-throw error to mark execution as failure
      }
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Mapping
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/concepts/mapping

Mapping

In Flatfile, *mapping* describes the process of getting data from an uploaded
file into a destination worksheet in your application.

## The Ghost of Mapping Past

Historically mapping in Flatfile has consisted of two pieces:

1. A *field mapping* which describes which columns in the source data
   corresponds to which fields in the destination worksheet. For example, maybe
   the "fname" column in the source data should be mapped to the "First Name"
   field in the destination worksheet.
2. For every destination field of type [enum](/learning-center/blueprint/field-types#enum), an
   *enum mapping* describing which values in the source column correspond to
   which allowable enum values in the destination column. For example, you could
   have an enum column of country codes, and you might need the source value
   "United States" to map to the enum value "US".

Flatfile has developed machine-learning models trained on millions of historical
mappings that can suggest both field and enum mappings based on the column names
and values in the source data. You can of course override these suggestions. The
Flatfile platform remembers your previously chosen mappings and will suggest
them when it sees similar schemas / data in the future.

## The Ghost of Mapping Present

Many users of Flatfile need more control over the mapping process than just
assigning source fields to destination fields. For example, you might need to
concatenate multiple source fields into a single destination field, or you might
need to choose the first non-empty value from a set of source fields.

To this end, we've recently introduced a wider variety of
[mapping rules](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-mapping/blob/main/README.md#mapping-rules)
that specify these more complex mapping-related transformations on your data,
and the notion of a *mapping program* that selectively applies these rules to
your dataset.

As of right now the only rule type supported by the Flatfile application is the
`assign` rule, as described above.

However, we have introduced a
[Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/flatfile-mapping/) that
allows you to create your own mapping rules and mapping programs and apply them
to your own datasets outside of Flatfile (e.g. in an ETL pipeline). The SDK is
currently in extreme beta, but we would love to hear your feedback on it. It
supports the full complement of mapping rules, as described on its website.

If you have a Flatfile secret key, the SDK also exposes an "automapping" feature
that uses the previously-described machine learning models to suggest mapping
programs for a given source and destination schema. As with the Flatfile app,
this feature currently only provides `assign` rules (and also `ignore` rules
that don't do anything but just communicate that a source field was not mapped).

## The Ghost of Mapping Future

In the near future we will be expanding mapping in several ways:

### Richer Mapping Rules in the Flatfile application

We are working on adding support for the full set of mapping rules in the
Flatfile application. This will allow a user mapping an incoming file to create
complex mapping programs, save them, and reuse them.

### Richer AI Assist for Mapping Rules

Currently our machine learning algorithms only suggest "assign" rules. In the
future they will also be able to suggest more complex mapping rules; for
instance, if your incoming data had a "first name" and "last name" field, and
your destination sheet only a "full name" field, the AI might suggest a
"concatenate" rule that combines the two source fields into the destination
field.

In addition, we are working on a natural-language interface for creating mapping
rules; for instance, you could type "concatenate first name and last name into
full name" and the AI would produce the appropriate rule.

### JavaScript SDK

We are working on a JavaScript SDK that has similar functionality to the Python
SDK, the most notable difference being that it can't interact with Pandas
dataframes. It will be available soon.


# Using actions
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/actions

Trigger operations based on user input.

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

An Action is a code-based operation that runs where that Action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile.

## Overview

Workbook & Sheet-mounted Actions are configured within a <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">Blueprint</Tooltip> object, while File-mounted actions are appended to the file during the upload process.

The executable code within an Action is compiled into a <Tooltip tip="Large asynchronous work...">Job</Tooltip> entity, providing the capability to run asynchronously or immediately.

Sheet-mounted actions can be executed on the entire Sheet, for a filtered view of the Sheet, or selectively for the chosen records.

## Workbook-mounted

Once a user has extracted and mapped data into a <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks)</Tooltip>, it may be more efficient to run an operation on the entire dataset rather than making atomic transformations at the record- or field-level.

For example:

* Sending a webhook that notifies your API of the data's readiness
* Populating a Sheet with data from another source
* Adding two different fields together after a user review's initial validation checks
* Moving valid data from an editable Sheet to a read-only Sheet

Workbook-mounted actions are represented as buttons in the top right of the Workbook.
![workbook\_actions\_primary](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/actions/workbook_actions_primary.png)

### Usage

First, configure your action on your Blueprint.

<Info>
  If you configure `primary: true` on an Action, it will be represented as the
  rightmost button in the Workbook.

  If you configure `trackChanges: true`, it will disable your actions
  until all commits are complete (usually data hooks).
</Info>

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit_pt1.mdx" />

Next, listen for a `job:ready` and filter on the `job` you'd like to process. Be sure to complete the job when it's complete.

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit_pt2.mdx" />

## Document-mounted

Document-mounted actions are similar to Workbook-mounted actions. They appear in the top right corner of your Document:

![Document actions](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/actions/document_actions.png)

Read more about Documents [here](/learning-center/guides/documents).

### Usage

Define Document-mounted Actions using the `actions` parameter when you create a Document.

<Info>
  If you configure `primary: true` on an Action, it will be represented as the
  rightmost button in the Document.
</Info>

<Snippet file="guides/documents/document-actions.mdx" />

In your listener, listen for the job's event and perform your desired operations.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js listener.js
  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener) {
    listener.on(
      "job:ready",
      { job: "document:contacts:submit" },
      async (event) => {
        const { context, payload } = event;
        const { jobId, workbookId } = context;

        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Starting submit job...",
            // "progress" value must be a whole integer
            progress: 10,
            estimatedCompletionAt: new Date("Tue Aug 23 2023 16:19:42 GMT-0700"),
          });

          // Do your work here

          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: `Submit job was completed succesfully.`,
            },
          });
        } catch (error) {
          console.log(`There was an error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: `This job failed.`,
            },
          });
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```

  ```js listener.ts
  import { FlatfileListener, FlatfileEvent } from "@flatfile/listener";

  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener: FlatfileListener) {
    listener.on(
      "job:ready",
      { job: "document:contacts:submit" },
      async (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
        const { context, payload } = event;
        const { jobId, workbookId } = context;

        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Starting submit job...",
            // "progress" value must be a whole integer
            progress: 10,
            estimatedCompletionAt: new Date("Tue Aug 23 2023 16:19:42 GMT-0700"),
          });

          // Do your work here

          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: `Submit job was completed succesfully.`,
            },
          });
        } catch (error) {
          console.log(`There was an error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: `This job failed.`,
            },
          });
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Sheet-mounted

<Info>Each Sheet has built-in Actions like download.</Info>

Sheet-mounted actions are represented as a dropdown in the toolbar of the Sheet.

![Sheet actions](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/actions/sheet_actions.png)

### Usage

First, configure your action on your Blueprint.

```jsx sheet.js
sheets : [
  {
    name: "Sheet Name",
    actions: [
      {
        operation: 'duplicate',
        mode: 'background',
        label: 'Duplicate selected names',
        description: 'Duplicate names for selected rows',
        primary: true,
      },
      {...}
    ]
  }
]
```

Next, listen for a `job:ready` and filter on the `domain` (sheet) and the
`operation` of where the action was placed. Be sure to complete to job when
it's complete.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx listener.js
  listener.on(
    "job:ready",
    { job: "sheet:duplicate" },
    async ({ context: { jobId } }) => {
      try {
        await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
          info: "Getting started.",
          // "progress" value must be a whole integer
          progress: 10,
          estimatedCompletionAt: new Date("Tue Aug 23 2023 16:19:42 GMT-0700"),
        });

        // Do your work here

        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          info: "This job is now complete.",
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error.stack);

        await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
          info: "This job did not work.",
        });
      }
    }
  );
  ```

  ```jsx listener.ts
  listener.on(
    "job:ready",
    { job: "sheet:duplicate" },
    async ({ context: { jobId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {
      try {
        await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
          info: "Getting started.",
          // "progress" value must be a whole integer
          progress: 10,
          estimatedCompletionAt: new Date("Tue Aug 23 2023 16:19:42 GMT-0700"),
        });

        // Do your work here

        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          info: "This job is now complete.",
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error.stack);

        await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
          info: "This job did not work.",
        });
      }
    }
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Retrieving data

Data from the Sheet can be retrieved either by calling the API with `records.get` or through data passed in through `event.data`. Here are some examples demonstrating how you can extract data from a Sheet-mounted action:

#### From the entire Sheet

This method allows you to access and process data from the complete Sheet, regardless of the current view or selected records.

```jsx
//inside listener.on()

const { jobId, sheetId } = event.context;

//retrieve all records from sheet
const response = await api.records.get(sheetId);

//print records
console.log(response.data.records);
```

#### From a filtered view of the Sheet

By applying filters to the Sheet, you can narrow down the data based on specific criteria. This enables you to retrieve and work with a subset of records that meet the defined filter conditions.

`event.data` returns a promise resolving to an object with a records property so we extract the records property directly from the event.data object.

<Warning>
  If rows are selected, only the corresponding records will be passed through
  the event for further processing.
</Warning>

```jsx
//inside listener.on()
const { jobId } = event.context;
const { records } = await event.data;

try {
  if (!records || records.length === 0) {
    console.log("No rows were selected or in view.");
    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message: "No rows were selected or in view, please try again.",
      },
    });
    return;
  }

  //print records
  console.log(records);

  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: "Records were printed to console, check it out.",
    },
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`);

  await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: "This action failed, check logs.",
    },
  });
}
```

#### For chosen records

When rows are selected, `event.data` will only extract information exclusively for the chosen records, providing focused data retrieval for targeted analysis or operations.

`event.data` returns a promise resolving to an object with a records property so we extract the records property directly from the event.data object.

<Note>This code is the same as the filtered view of the Sheet.</Note>

```jsx
//inside listener.on()
const { jobId } = event.context;
const { records } = await event.data;

try {
  if (!records || records.length === 0) {
    console.log("No rows were selected or in view.");
    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message: "No rows were selected or in view, please try again.",
      },
    });
    return;
  }

  //print records
  console.log(records);

  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: "Records were printed to console, check it out.",
    },
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`);

  await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: "This action failed, check logs.",
    },
  });
}
```

## File-mounted

<Info>Each file has built-in actions like Delete and Download.</Info>

File-mounted actions are represented as a dropdown menu for each file in the Files list. You can attach additional actions to a File.

![file actions](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/actions/file_actions.png)

### Usage

First, listen for a `file:ready` event and add one or more actions to the file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx listener.js file:ready
  listener.on("file:created", async ({ context: { fileId } }) => {
    const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
    const actions = file.data?.actions || [];
    const newActions = [
      ...actions,
      {
        operation: "logFileContents",
        label: "Log File Metadata",
        description: "This will log the file metadata.",
      },
      {
        operation: "decryptAction",
        label: "Decrypt File",
        description: "This will create a new decrypted file.",
      },
    ];
    await api.files.update(fileId, {
      actions: newActions,
    });
  });
  ```

  ```jsx listener.ts file:ready
  listener.on("file:created", async ({ context: { fileId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {
    const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
    const actions = file.data?.actions || [];
    const newActions = [
      ...actions,
      {
        operation: "logFileContents",
        label: "Log File Metadata",
        description: "This will log the file metadata.",
      },
      {
        operation: "decryptAction",
        label: "Decrypt File",
        description: "This will create a new decrypted file.",
      },
    ];
    await api.files.update(fileId, {
      actions: newActions,
    });
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, listen for `job:ready` and filter on the `domain` (file) and the `operation` of where the Action was placed. Be sure to complete to job when it's complete.

<CodeGroup>
  ```JavaScript listener.js job:ready
  //when the button is clicked in the file dropdown

  listener.on(
    "job:ready",
    { job: "file:logFileContents" },
    async ({ context: { fileId, jobId } }) => {
      await acknowledgeJob(jobId, "Gettin started.", 10);

      const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
      console.log({ file });

      await completeJob(jobId, "Logging file contents is complete.");
    }
  );

  listener.on(
    "job:ready",
    { job: "file:decryptAction" },
    async ({ context: { spaceId, fileId, jobId, environmentId } }) => {
      try {
        await acknowledgeJob(jobId, "Gettin started.", 10);

        const fileResponse = await api.files.get(fileId);

        const buffer = await getFileBufferFromApi(fileId);
        const { name, ext } = fileResponse.data;
        const newFileName = name
          ? name.split(".")[0] + "[Decrypted]." + ext
          : "DecryptedFile.csv";

        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append("file", buffer, { filename: newFileName });
        formData.append("spaceId", spaceId);
        formData.append("environmentId", environmentId);

        await uploadDecryptedFile(formData);

        await completeJob(jobId, "Decrypting is now complete.");
      } catch (e) {
        await failJob(jobId, "The decryption job failed.");
      }
    }
  );

  async function acknowledgeJob(jobId, info, progress, estimatedCompletionAt) {
    await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
      info,
      progress,
      estimatedCompletionAt
    });
  }

  async function completeJob(jobId, message) {
    await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message,
      },
    });
  }

  async function failJob(jobId, message) {
    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message,
      },
    });
  }
  ```

  ```jsx listener.ts job:ready
  //when the button is clicked in the file dropdown

    async ({ context: { fileId, jobId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {
      await acknowledgeJob(jobId, "Gettin started.", 10);

      const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
      console.log({ file });

      await completeJob(jobId, "Logging file contents is complete.");

## Actions with Input Forms

If you configure input fields for your action, a secondary dialog will be presented to the end user, prompting them to provide the necessary information. Once the user has entered the required details, they can proceed with the action.

### Usage

First, configure your action to have an inputForm on your Blueprint. These will appear once the action button is clicked.

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit_pt4.mdx" />

Next, listen for a `job:ready` and filter on the `job` you'd like to process. Grab the data entered in the form from the job itself and leverage it as required for your use case.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js listener.js
  import api from "@flatfile/api";

  export default async function (listener) {
    listener.on(
      "job:ready",
      { job: "workbook:actionWithInput" },
      async (event) => {
        const { jobId } = event.context;

        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Acknowledging job",
            progress: 1,
          });

          // retrieve input
          const { data: job } = await api.jobs.get(jobId);
          const input = job.input;
          console.log({ input });

          // do something with input...

          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: "Action was successful",
            },
          });
          return;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: "Action failed",
            },
          });
          return;
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```

  ```ts listener.ts
  import api from "@flatfile/api";
  import type { FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";

  export default async function (listener: FlatfileListener) {
    listener.on(
      "job:ready",
      { job: "workbook:actionWithInput" },
      async (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
        const { jobId } = event.context;

        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Acknowledging job",
            progress: 1,
          });

          // retrieve input
          const { data: job } = await api.jobs.get(jobId);
          const input = job.input;
          console.log({ input });

          // do something with input...

          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: "Action was successful",
            },
          });
          return;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message: "Action failed",
            },
          });
          return;
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Actions with Constraints

### Usage

#### Workbook & Sheet-mounted

1. Adding a `hasAllValid` constraint on an Action will
   disable a Workbook Action when there are invalid records.
2. Adding a `hasData` on an Action will
   disable a Workbook Action when there are no records.

```jsx
actions: [
  {
    operation: 'submitActionFg',
    mode: 'foreground',
    label: 'Submit data elsewhere',
    description: 'Submit this data to a webhook.',
    primary: true,
    constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid'},{ type: 'hasData' }]
  },
  {...}
],
```

#### Sheet-Mounted only

Adding a constraint of `hasSelection` on an Action will disable a Sheet Action when no records in the Sheet are selected.

```jsx sheet.js
sheets : [
  {
    name: "Sheet Name",
    actions: [
      {
        operation: 'duplicate',
        mode: 'background',
        label: 'Duplicate selected names',
        description: 'Duplicate names for selected rows',
        constraints: [{ type: 'hasSelection' }],
        primary: true,
      },
      {...}
    ]
  }
]
```

## Actions with Messages

Add custom messages to actions, tailored according to their state:

* Error
* Info

These messages will be displayed as tooltips when users hover over an action, providing context-specific text that corresponds to the action's current state. When an error message is present on an action, the action will be disabled.

### Usage

Simply add a messages property to your action configuration. This property should be an array of objects, each specifying a message type and its content.

```jsx
  actions: [
    {
      operation: 'duplicate',
      mode: 'background',
      label: 'Duplicate selected names',
      description: 'Duplicate names for selected rows',
      messages: [
        { type: 'error', content: 'This is an error message' },
      ],
      primary: true,
    },
    {...}
  ]
```

# Accepting Additional fields
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/additional-fields

create additional fields on the fly

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

The `allowAdditionalFields` feature offers a fluid integration experience,
allowing users to effortlessly map to new or unconfigured fields in your
Blueprints.

## How it works

* By enabling `allowAdditionalFields`, your Sheet isn't restricted to the
  initial configuration. It can adapt to include new fields, whether they're
  anticipated or not.
* These supplementary fields can either be added through API calls or input
  directly by users during the file import process.
* To ensure clarity, any field that wasn't part of the original Blueprint
  configuration is flagged with a `treatment` property labeled `user-defined`.
* When adding a custom field, there's no need to fuss over naming the field. The
  system intuitively adopts the header name from the imported file, streamlining
  the process.

In essence, the `allowAdditionalFields` feature is designed for scalability and
ease, ensuring your Blueprints are always ready for unexpected data fields.

## Example Blueprint w/ `allowAdditionalFields`

```json
{
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "allowAdditionalFields": true,
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "label": "First Name",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "lastName",
          "label": "Last Name",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "email",
          "label": "Email",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Automate with automap
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/automap

automatically map your data fields

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

### Usage

A key component of Flatfile's headless automation workflow is the automapping
functionality provided by our
[Automap Plugin](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-automap/).

Upon uploading a file, after file extraction is complete, the data needs to be
mapped to a destination Workbook. In a non-headless environment a human might do
this manually. But in a headless environment, we'll automate this process.

We'll use Automap to do this for us.

### Install

First, add the plugin to your project.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block1.mdx" />

### Configure

Next, configure the plugin. Choose an accuracy level, a default target sheet,
and a regex expression to test incoming files.

**accuracy:** either `confident` or `exact` \
**defaultTargetSheet:** the name of the sheet you want to map to \
**matchFilename:** regex that will match on incoming files

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block2.mdx" />

<br />

<Note>
  Note you may also set `debug` to true for useful error messages in
  development.
</Note>

### Deploy and watch it work

Add your configured listener to your project and deploy it to Flatfile.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block3.mdx" />


# Data Retention
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/data-retention

implementing Data Retention Policies in Flatfile

<Tip>
  **Curious about activating Data Retention?** Talk with one of our product
  experts to discover how Flatfile's Data Retention Policy can help you control
  the lifecycle of your data within Flatfile on our
  **[Enterprise](https://flatfile.com/pricing/)** plan. [Connect with a product
  expert.](https://flatfile.com/contact-sales/consult/)
</Tip>

## Introduction

Data retention policies are crucial for managing and controlling the lifecycle
of data within your Flatfile account. In this guide, we'll walk you through the
process of adding and configuring data retention policies based on our two
options `last activity` and `since created` policy types. These policies will
help you automatically clean up outdated data within your Flatfile environment,
ensuring optimal data hygiene.

Flatfile will expire Spaces (the Space will no longer be accessible but will
still appear in the Spaces' response) and delete any data that was uploaded or
added to the respective Space.

<Note>
  Flatfile has a 7 day policy which means that your data may be deleted +/- 7
  days from your defined period.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you start implementing data retention policies, make sure you have:

1. A Flatfile account with administrative privileges.
2. Familiarity with your data and the desired retention periods.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to your Flatfile account.
2. Navigate to the dashboard, where you can manage and configure your Spaces.

## Understanding Data Deletion Logic

Let's clarify the logic behind data deletion based on the example you provided:

### Since Created Policy Example:

* Space created on January 1st.
* Policy set to 2 days.
* If Flatfile's cron event runs on January 2nd, any Space created before January
  1st (older than 2 days) will be expired. Any data that was uploaded to the
  Spaces will be deleted.

### Last Activity Policy Example:

* Space last modified on January 1st.
* Policy set to 3 days.
* If Flatfile's cron event runs on January 4th, any Space that hasn't been
  modified since January 1st (older than 3 days) will be expired. Any data that
  was uploaded to the Spaces will be deleted.

## Monitoring and Adjusting Policies

Regularly monitor the results of the data retention policies to ensure they
align with your data management goals. If needed, adjust the policy time periods
based on your evolving data requirements.

## Implementing via api

If you'd like to create, update, delete your policy via API, check out our
[API reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/)


# Data Clips (Beta)
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/dataclips

isolate, edit, collaborate-on, and re-integrate subsets of Sheet data

Data Clips is a powerful, built-in feature in Flatfile that makes data collaboration and issue resolution fast, secure, and incredibly easy.

<Snippet file="shared/projects_only.mdx" />

<Note>
  Data Clips is currently in Beta and may have some limitations and unexpected behavior.
</Note>

## What are Data Clips?

Data Clips are subsets of Sheet data where users can edit and collaborate without affecting the original dataset. Data Clips were developed to enable teams to:

* Create isolated working environments for data modifications
* Enable parallel workflows across different teams
* Maintain data integrity through controlled update processes
* Share specific data segments with collaborators
* Implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms

## Creating A Data Clip

To create a Data Clip, go to the source Sheet and select which Records you would like to work on.
Use the built in sheet action to create the clip, giving it a title, optional comment, and collaborators.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/data-clips/create_dc.png" alt="Create Data Clip" width="75%" style={{ margin: '0 auto' }} />

<Info>
  Adding Records to Data Clips is allowed only when the Data Clip is in an Open and Ready state.
  See [Data Clip States](#reference) for more information.
</Info>

## Using Data Clips

### Collaborating

Data Clips are a collaborative feature. Any guest of your Space may be invited to collaborate on a Data Clip.
Once added, collaborators can edit, leave comments, and review changes before the Data Clip is merged back into the source Sheet.

### Adding Records

Record management within Data Clips is designed to be flexible and intuitive.
Users can add records to existing clips as needed. From the source Sheet, selecting the Records you wish to add, then select the `Add Records to Data Clip` Sheet action.

### Deleting Records

Users may flag records for deletion in a Data Clip. While working in the clip, these records will appear with a strikethrough to show they'll be deleted.
You can restore marked records at any time before merging. After merging, these records will be removed from the main sheet.

### Conflict Resolution

If the same record has been modified in both the Data Clip and the main sheet, a conflict
resolution interface ensures that users can make an informed decision on which version to keep.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/data-clips/conflict_resolution.png" alt="Conflict Resolution" width="75%" style={{ margin: '0 auto' }} />

### Merging Changes

Once changes are finalized, they can be merged back into the main sheet, ensuring controlled updates while preserving the original dataset's integrity.

When merging a Data Clip, a visual diff of all changes allows users to confirm updates before they are applied.

<Note>
  Only the creator of a Data Clip has the authority to merge changes back into the main sheet, maintaining control over the final updates.
</Note>

## Data Clip Library

Multiple Data Clips can be created from a single sheet, enabling different teams or individuals to work in parallel without interfering with each other's workflows.

The Data Clip Library provides an organized way to find and manage Data Clips. Users can search for Data Clips by name, creator or source SheetId. The library also supports filtering by status, making it easy to locate specific clips.

# Build Documents
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/documents

Learn how to build pages in your sidebar with Documents.

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Documents are standalone webpages for your Flatfile <Tooltip tip="Are micro-applications...">[Spaces](/learning-center/architecture/spaces)</Tooltip>. They can be rendered from <Tooltip tip="View syntax">[Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)</Tooltip>.

Often used for getting started guides, Documents become extremely powerful with dynamically generated content that stays updated as Events occur.

<Info>
  Flatfile also allows you to use HTML tags in your Markdown-formatted text.
  This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax.
</Info>

## Create a Document

You can create Documents using the API:

<Snippet file="guides/documents/create-document.mdx" />

This Document will now appear in the sidebar of your Space.

In this example, we create a Document when a file is uploaded, but you can also create Documents in response to any other Event. [Read more](/learning-center/concepts/events) about the different Events you can respond to.

## Document Actions

Actions are optional and allow you to run custom operations in response to a user-triggered event from within a Document.

Define Actions on a Document using the `actions` parameter when a document is created:

<Snippet file="guides/documents/document-actions.mdx" />

Then configure your listener to handle this Action, and define what should happen in response. Read more about Actions and how to handle them [here](./actions#document-mounted).

Actions appear as buttons in the top right corner of your Document:

![Document actions](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/actions/document_actions.png)

## Document treatments

Documents have an optional `treatments` parameter which takes an array of treatments for your Document. Treatments can be used to categorize your Document. Certain treatments will cause your Document to look or behave differently.

### Ephemeral documents

Giving your Document a treatment of `"ephemeral"` will cause the Document to appear as a full-screen takeover, and it will not appear in the sidebar of your Space like other Documents. You can use ephemeral Documents to create a more focused experience for your end users.

```ts
const ephemeralDoc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
  title: 'Getting started',
  body: '# Welcome ...',
  treatments: ['ephemeral'],
})
```

<Info>
  Currently, `"ephemeral"` is the only treatment that will change the behavior
  of your Document. Other treatments will not affect how your Document behaves,
  but can be used for your own purposes to categorize and describe your
  Documents in code.
</Info>

## Adding Blocks to Documents

Blocks are dynamic, embedded entities that you can use to display data inside a Document. You can add a Block to a Document using the `<embed>` HTML entity in your markdown and specifying which Block type you want to show using the `type` attribute on the entity. Two Block types are currently supported: Embedded Sheet and Embedded Diff.

### Embedded Sheet

Use this Block to render a Sheet along with all its data inside of a Document. You can embed a Sheet into your Document by passing a sheet ID, workbook ID, and name. You can also specify whether the embedded Sheet is expanded or collapsed when the document is loaded.

<Info>
  You can include as many embedded Sheets in your Document as you like, but end
  users will only be able to expand a maximum of 10 embedded Sheets at once.
</Info>

```ts
const doc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
  title: 'Getting started',
  body: 
    "# Welcome\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Here is an embedded Sheet:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "<embed type='embedded-sheet' name='Contacts' defaultExpanded='true' sheetId='your_sheet_id' workbookId='your_workbook_id'>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Here is another embedded Sheet:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "<embed type='embedded-sheet' name='Countries' sheetId='us_sh_TVW95224' workbookId='us_wb_8e0z52gI'>"
  ,
})
```

### Embedded Diff

Use this Block to show a side-by-side comparison of the data in a Sheet now versus at a previous point in time as captured by a Snapshot. Pass a Sheet ID, Workbook ID, and Snapshot ID. You can optionally pass a `direction` attribute which specified whether the changes are displayed with the Snapshot as the end state (`sheet_to_snapshot`) or the Sheet as the end state (`snapshot_to_sheet`). The default value for direction is `sheet_to_snapshot`.

<Info>
  Use `direction="sheet_to_snapshot"` if you want to show changes that have been
  made since the time the Snapshot was taken, i.e. to review past changes. Use
  `direction="snapshot_to_sheet"` if to preview the changes that would occur if
  you were to revert your Sheet back to the state it was in when the Snapshot
  was taken.
</Info>

```ts
const doc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
  title: 'Getting started',
  body: 
    "# Welcome\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Here is an embedded Diff:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "<embed type='embedded-diff' sheetId='your_sheet_id' workbookId='your_workbook_id' snapshot_id='your_snapshot_id" direction="snapshot_to_sheet">"
  ,
})
```

# Dynamically configure anything
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/dynamic-configurations

dynamically build your Space configuration as it's created

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Flatfile can support the simplest of workflows to the most nuanced & complex
with Dynamic Spaces.

## Use cases

The use cases for dynamic configuration are endless, here are just a few ideas:

* Perhaps the user who is creating the Space informs how you want that Space to
  look for them
* Or maybe someone's location defines a different type of currency in your Sheet
  configuration
* Or say you need data from an external API in a precise moment in time to
  determine how you want your Workbook to look

Continue reading to learn how to configure a Space from scratch, and update it
as things change.

## Configuring a new Space

### From the dashboard

When the "Create New Space" button is clicked on the platform, it triggers a
[job `event`](/learning-center/concepts/events) within the **space** `domain` that
initiates a **configure** `operation`. This operation is analogous to performing
a POST request to the endpoint
[/api/v1/spaces](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/spaces/create)
with the parameter `autoconfigure` set to true.

1. Filter on the `domain` (space) and the `operation` (configure).
2. Listen for a [`job:ready`](/learning-center/concepts/events#job-ready) event.
3. Build your Space, at minimum including one Workbook.
4. Complete the job.
5. Optionally, listen for new events that are spawned from within your
   `space:configure` job.

#### Usage

In the following example, we build a Workbook and our getting started guide. You
can also follow along in the
[flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink/blob/main/javascript/dynamic-configurations/index.js)
Github sandbox.

<Tip>
  Be sure to complete the job when it's complete. This tells the platform that
  you're finished and ready to display the Space to the end user.
</Tip>

<Snippet file="guides/dynamic-configurations/block1.mdx" />

### From an embedded button

When embedding Flatfile in your application, two things can happen:

1. A new Space is created every time the Flatfile platform is called to open
2. Or an existing Space can be passed in.

Listeners can be set up either server-side (use this Guide) and/or client-side
within the embedded wrapper SDK.

Learn more about this [use case](/learning-center/use-cases/portal).

### Automatically

New Spaces can be created automatically by setting up headless flows.

Learn more about this [use case](/learning-center/guides/automap).

***

## Updating a Space in place

As things are changing in a Space, sometimes you may want to adjust the
configuration of your Space. You can do this by listening for events that take
place, and performing work as a result.

### After an action is fired

When a button is clicked in the user interface, this creates a job. You are
already listening for this job to respond and do the work of that Action;
however, you may also want to adjust some of your configuration at the same
time, too.

#### Usage

In the following example, we lock down access to the original Sheet and update
our getting started guide to reflect the change.

<Snippet file="guides/dynamic-configurations/block2.mdx" />

### After data changes

As the Sheet is being updated with data, perhaps you want to change the
configuration. In the following example, we listed for a commit created to do
just that.

#### Usage

<Snippet file="guides/dynamic-configurations/block3.mdx" />

# Egress out
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/egress

get data out of Flatfile

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

After your customers have imported their data, the process of transmitting that
data to an external destination or network is referred to as "egress out."

## Egress via Workbook-level Action

This code listens for a job event of type `workbook:submitAction` and when
triggered, it retrieves the Sheets and records associated with the workbook.

It then prepares the data and sends a `POST` request to a specified webhook URL
using Axios. The payload includes information about the Sheets, records, and
other relevant data.

If the request is successful, it marks the job as complete. If there is an
error, it marks the job as failed.

#### Testing with webhook.site

1. To create the receiver, navigate to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
2. Copy the value of the path after webhook.site for `Your unique URL`.
3. Next, add the following to your default export function.

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit_pt1.mdx" />

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit_pt2.mdx" />

# Using Flatfile query language
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/flatfile_query_language

Learn how to filter data in Sheets with FFQL.

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

FFQL (Flatfile Query Language) is Flatfile's custom query language used for filtering data in <Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">[Sheets](/learning-center/blueprint/about)</Tooltip>.
It's logical, composable, and human-readable.

## Overview

### Search by value

Here's an example request for searching for rows where the First Name column is "Bender" and the Last Name column is "Rodriguez".

```sql GET sheets/<sheetId>/records request
GET sheets/<sheetId>/records?q=first_name eq Bender and last_name eq Rodriguez
```

```sql query
first_name eq Bender and last_name eq Rodriguez
```

### Search for null

Here's an example request for searching for rows where the First Name column is null.

```sql GET sheets/<sheetId>/records request
GET sheets/<sheetId>/records?q=first_name eq ""
```

```sql query
first_name eq ""
```

***

## Syntax

The basic syntax of FFQL is:

```sql
[field name] <operator> <value>
```

### Field Name

`field name` is optional and excluding a field name will search across all fields. For example: `eq "Planet Express"` will search across all fields for that value.
`field name` can be the field key or the field label.

Labels or values with spaces should be wrapped in quotes. For example: `name eq "Bender Rodriguez"`, or `"First Name" eq Bender`.

### Operators

FFQL operators are:

* `eq` - Equals (exact match)
* `ne` - Not Equal
* `lt` - Less Than
* `gt` - Greater Than
* `lte` - Less Than or Equal To
* `gte` - Greater Than or Equal To
* `like` - (Case Sensitive) Like
* `ilike` - (Case Insensitive) Like
* `contains` - Contains (for columns of type `string-list` and `enum-list`)

Both `like` and `ilike` support the following wildcards:

* `%` - Matches any number of characters
* `_` - Matches a single character

So, for instance, `like "Bender%"` would match "Bender Rodriguez" and "Bender Bending Rodriguez".

### Logical Operators

FFQL supports two logical operators:

* `and` - Returns rows meeting both conditions
* `or` - Returns rows meeting either conditions (inclusive)

### The `is` Operator

You can query for message statuses by using the `is` operator. For example: `is error` returns all the rows in an `error` state. `is valid` returns all the rows in a `valid` state. `first_name is error` returns the rows where First Name is in an `error` state.

***

## Constructing Queries

Complex queries are possible using a combination of operators:

```sql
(
    email like "@gmail.com"
    and (
        "Subscription Status" eq "On-Hold"
        or "Subscription Status" eq "Pending"
    )
    and login_attempts gte 5
)
or is warning
```

This query would return all the rows that:

1. Have a Gmail email address,
2. Have a Subscription Status of "On-Hold" or "Pending",
3. And have more than 5 login attempts.

<Note>It will also include any rows that have a "Warning" message status.</Note>

***

## Usage

### Via search bar

From the search bar in a Workbook, prepend **filter:** to your FFQL query.

```json type in search bar
filter: first_name eq Bender and last_name eq Rodriguez
```

### Via API

FFQL queries can be passed to any <Tooltip tip="View API reference">[REST API](https://reference.flatfile.com/overview/welcome)</Tooltip> endpoint that supports the `q` parameter.

Here's an example **cURL** request using the `sheets/<sheetId>/records` endpoint:

```shell Shell / cURL
curl --location 'https://platform.flatfile.com/api/sheets/us_sh_12345678/records?q="Subscription Status" eq "On-Hold" or "Subscription Status" eq "Pending"' \
    --header 'Accept: */*' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <bearer token>'
```

Make sure to [encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_encoding) percent characters if you use them.

# Handling data
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/handling-data

process data with Data Hooks

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

**Data Hooks®** are concise functions that automatically **re-format**,
**correct**, **validate**, and **enrich** data during the data import process.
These hooks can be executed on a complete record, or row, of data using methods
on the `FlatfileRecord` class.

Record-level hooks have access to all fields in a row and should be utilized for
operations that require access to multiple fields or when creating a new field.

## Getting started

The `FlatfileRecord` class provides methods to manipulate and interact with a
record in the Flatfile format, including setting values, retrieving values,
adding information messages, performing computations, validating fields, and
converting the record to JSON format.

Listen for updates to data records, and respond with three types of record
hooks: `compute`, `computeIfPresent`, and `validate`. These hooks are available
as methods on the `FlatfileRecord` class.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js recordHook
  import { recordHook, FlatfileRecord } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";
  ```

  ```js bulkRecordHook
  import { bulkRecordHook, FlatfileRecord } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  In these examples, we'll reference the Workbook from the [Quickstart
  guide](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-workbook#building-your-first-workbook).
</Info>

## Record Hooks

### `FlatfileRecord.compute`

Computes a new value for a field based on its original value or other field
values on the record. Optionally pass an [info message](#flatfilerecord-addinfo)
to surface to the user about the transformation. `compute` will run even when no
value is set for the field (see
[`computeIfPresent`](#flatfilerecord-computeifpresent)).

### Syntax

```js
FlatfileRecord.compute(fieldName, transformation, message);
```

<ParamField path="fieldName" type="string">
  The name of the field to transform.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transformation" type="(value, record) => string | number | boolean | null">
  The transformation to perform on the field value. Receives the initial value
  of the field, as well as the entire record if you want to access other field
  values on the record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  (optional) a message to show on the cell after the transformation.
</ParamField>

### Example

Generate email from first and last name:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js javascript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
      record.compute(
        "email",
        (email, record) =>
          `${record.get("firstName")}${record.get("lastName")}@gmail.com`,
        "Email was generated from first and last name.",
      );
      return record;
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```js typescript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
      record.compute(
        "email",
        (email, record) => {
          return `${record.get("firstName")}${record.get("lastName")}@gmail.com`;
        },
        // optional
        "Email was generated from first and last name."
      );
      return record;
    })
  );
  ```

  ```js javascript bulkRecordHook()
  listener.use(
    bulkRecordHook("contacts", (records) => {
      records.map((record) => {
        record.compute(
          "email",
          (email, record) =>
            `${record.get("firstName")}${record.get("lastName")}@gmail.com`,
          "Email was generated from first and last name.",
        );
        return record;
      });
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```js typescript bulkRecordHook()
  listener.use(
    bulkRecordHook("contacts", (records: FlatfileRecord[]) => {
      records.map((record: FlatfileRecord) => {
        record.compute(
          "email",
          (email, record) => {
            return `${record.get("firstName")}${record.get(
              "lastName"
            )}@gmail.com`;
          },
          // optional
          "Email was generated from first and last name."
        );
        return record;
      });
    })
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### FlatfileRecord.computeIfPresent

Same as [compute](#flatfilerecord-compute), but only computes a new value if an
initial value is provided (not null). Useful for computations that may throw an
error on null values.

#### Syntax

```js
FlatfileRecord.computeIfPresent(fieldName, transformation, message);
```

<ParamField path="fieldName" type="string">
  The name of the field to transform.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transformation" type="(value, record) => string | number | boolean | null">
  The transformation to perform on the field value. Receives the initial value
  of the field, as well as the entire record if you want to access other field
  values on the record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  (optional) a message to show on the cell after the transformation.
</ParamField>

#### Example

Change email to lower case:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js javascript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
      record.computeIfPresent(
        "email",
        (email) => email.toLowerCase(),
        // optional
        "Email was converted to lowercase.",
      );
      return record;
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```js typescript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
      record.computeIfPresent(
        "email",
        (email: string) => email.toLowerCase(),
        // optional
        "Email was converted to lowercase."
      );
      return record;
    })
  );
  ```

  ```js javascript bulkRecordHook()
  listener.use(
    bulkRecordHook("contacts", (records) => {
      records.map((record) => {
        record.computeIfPresent(
          "email",
          (email) => email.toLowerCase(),
          // optional
          "Email was converted to lowercase.",
        );
        return record;
      });
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```js typescript bulkRecordHook()
  listener.use(
    bulkRecordHook("contacts", (records: FlatfileRecord[]) => {
      records.map((record: FlatfileRecord) => {
        record.computeIfPresent(
          "email",
          (email: string) => email.toLowerCase(),
          // optional
          "Email was converted to lowercase."
        );
        return record;
      });
    })
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### FlatfileRecord.validate

Sets a field as invalid if its value does not meet a specified condition, and
displays an [error message](#flatfilerecord-adderror) to the user.

#### Syntax

```js
validate(fieldName, validator, message);
```

<ParamField path="fieldName" type="string">
  The name of the field to validate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="validator" type="(value, record) => boolean">
  A function that determines whether a given field value is valid. Receives the
  initial value of the field, as well as the entire record if you want to access
  other field values on the record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  A message to show on the cell if the field is invalid.
</ParamField>

#### Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```js javascript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
      record.validate(
        "lastName",
        (value) => !/\d/.test(value.toString()),
        "Last name cannot contain numbers",
      );
      return record;
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```js typescript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
      record.validate(
        "lastName",
        (value) => typeof value === "string" && !/\d/.test(value),
        "Last name cannot contain numbers"
      );
      return record;
    })
  );
  ```

  ```js javascript bulkRecordHook()
  listener.use(
    bulkRecordHook("contacts", (records) => {
      records.map((record) => {
        record.validate(
          "lastName",
          (value) => !/\d/.test(value.toString()),
          "Last name cannot contain numbers",
        );
        return record;
      });
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```js typescript bulkRecordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (records: FlatfileRecord[]) => {
      records.map((record: FlatfileRecord) => {
        record.validate(
          "lastName",
          (value) => typeof value === "string" && !/\d/.test(value),
          "Last name cannot contain numbers"
        );
        return record;
      });
    })
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Messages

Attach comments, errors, and warnings to specific fields in each record. These
messages provide contextual information or alerts to users who interact with the
record, helping them understand any issues or actions required.

### FlatfileRecord.addInfo()

![Info](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/guides/FlatfileRecord_info.png)

This method adds an information message to one or more fields in the record.

#### Syntax

```jsx
addInfo(fields, message);
```

<ParamField path="fields" type="string | string[]">
  Can be either a string representing a single field or an array of strings
  representing multiple fields
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  The content of the message
</ParamField>

#### Example

```jsx
const email = record.get("email");
const validEmailAddress = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+.[^\s@]+$/;
if (email !== null && validEmailAddress.test(email)) {
  record.addInfo("email", "This email was verified.");
}
```

### FlatfileRecord.addError()

![Error](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/guides/FlatfileRecord_error.png)

This method adds an error message to one or more fields in the record.

#### Syntax

```jsx
addError(fields, message);
```

<ParamField path="fields" type="string | string[]">
  Can be either a string representing a single field or an array of strings
  representing multiple fields
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  The content of the message
</ParamField>

#### Example

```jsx
const email = record.get("email");
const validEmailAddress = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+.[^\s@]+$/;
if (email !== null && !validEmailAddress.test(email)) {
  record.addError("email", "This is not a valid email address.");
}
```

### FlatfileRecord.addWarning()

![Warning](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/guides/FlatfileRecord_warning.png)

This method adds a warning message to one or more fields in the record.

#### Syntax

```jsx
FlatfileRecord.addWarning(fields, message);
```

<ParamField path="fields" type="string | string[]">
  Can be either a string representing a single field or an array of strings
  representing multiple fields
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  The content of the message
</ParamField>

#### Example

```jsx
const email = record.get("email");
if (email === null) {
  record.addWarning(
    "email",
    "Without an email, we will default to name for unique id.",
  );
}
```

## Accessing an API

Accessing an API within a `recordHook` or a `bulkRecordHook` allows for
retrieving additional data or performing external operations to enrich or modify
existing data. This approach integrates external data sources or services into
the data manipulation workflow, enabling real-time or dynamic information to
enhance the data. It is particularly useful when fetching related data,
validating information, performing calculations, or any operation that relies on
external input before modifying the data.

### Using `GET`

When a record is created or updated, you may need to fetch data from an API.
Using a `GET` method does just that, then updates the record object with the
retrieved data, and handles any errors that may occur during the process.

#### Example

In this example, an API call is made to retrieve beer data, which is then used
to update the record object by setting the "assignedBeer" field with a random
name from the beer data.

If an error occurs, we update the `status` field to "Failed" and add an error
message. The modified record is then returned from the `recordHook`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js javascript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", async (record, event) => {
      try {
        const { payload } = event.payload;

        const getResponse = await axios.get(
          "https://api.sampleapis.com/beers/ale",

          "https://api.sampleapis.com/beers/ale"
        );
        await Promise.all(
          records.map(async (record) => {
            try {
              const { payload } = event.payload;

              record.set(
                "assignedBeer",
                getResponse.data[Math.floor(Math.random() * 20)].name
              );
              record.addInfo(
                "assignedBeer",
                "Got this from " + getResponse.config.url
              );
            } catch (error) {
              record.set("status", "Failed");
              record.addError(
                "status",
                "Couldn't get assigned beer data from the api."
              );
            } finally {
              // Clean up or perform any necessary actions after the try/catch block
            }

            return record;
          })
        );
      }
    )
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Using POST

When a record is created or updated, you may need to send data to an API. Sends
the payload data from an Event to a webhook receiver URL using a `POST` request,
then update the record object based on the success or failure of the request.
Last, add messages to the fields accordingly.

#### Example

In this example, we are making a `POST` request to a webhook endpoint using
axios. We pass the payload, method, and record as the request body and handle
the response.

If the request is successful, we update the `status` field of the record to
"Success" and add a comment. If an error occurs, we update the `status` field to
"Failed" and add an error message. The modified record is then returned from the
`recordHook`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript recordHook()
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", async (record, event) => {
      try {
        const { payload } = event.payload;

          process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL ||

## getLinks

The `getLinks` method is a feature of the FlatfileRecord class. When a field in
your record is of the Reference Field type and links to another record, getLinks
can fetch those linked fields for you.

### Usage

When processing a record, you may find references to a related record. To
retrieve the fields from the related record, use the `getLinks` method. Provide
the field key of the Reference Field type, the part of the record that holds the
reference to the other records, like this:

```javascript
const relatedRecords = record.getLinks("referenceFieldKey");
```

The getLinks method will then return an array containing all fields from the
linked record associated with the provided 'referenceFieldKey'. If there is not
a linked record associated with this field, an empty array will be returned.

### Benefits

Using `getLinks` provides access to all related information. It's particularly
useful when you want to perform operations similar to VLOOKUPs in spreadsheets,
or when you need to compare data across referenced fields.

For instance, you could use `getLinks` to fetch all the fields related to a
particular record and enrich your data, or compare the related records for
validation.

With `getLinks`, processing related datasets becomes much more manageable in
Flatfile. This method provides you with an effective way to navigate, enrich,
and validate your data.

## Deleting records

There are primarily two use cases for deleting records:

1. Deleting a subset of records
2. Deleting all records in a sheet

### Deleting a subset of records

To delete a subset of records first import the `@flatfile/api` package, then use
the `api.records.delete()` helper method. This method takes in an array of
record IDs and deletes them from the sheet.

Example:

```javascript
await api.records.delete(sheetId, { ids: [...] });
```

### Deleting all records in a sheet

For clearing an entire sheet of its records, set up a bulk delete job. This task
will comprehensively wipe out every record on the specified sheet. Check out our
[jobs documentation](/learning-center/concepts/jobs).

Example:

```javascript
await api.jobs.create({
  type: "workbook",
  operation: "delete-records",
  trigger: "immediate",
  source: workbookId,
  config: {
    sheet: sheetId,
    filter: "all",
  },
});
```

# Translating your Space
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/localization

translate and customize your Space with text overrides

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Tailor the language and text in your Flatfile Space with ease! This guide will
lead you step-by-step to allow you to both translate and personalize the text in
your Space in just a couple of simple steps.

## Available Languages

We support translations into these languages:

| Language                | Code       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| German                  | de         |
| English                 | en         |
| English - Great Britain | en-GB      |
| English - Canadian      | en-CA      |
| English - South African | en-ZA      |
| Spanish                 | es         |
| Spanish - Latin America | es-419     |
| French                  | fr         |
| French - Canadian       | fr-CA      |
| French - France         | fr-FR      |
| Indonesian              | id         |
| Italian                 | it         |
| Japanese                | jp         |
| Korean                  | kr         |
| Malay                   | ms         |
| Dutch                   | nl         |
| Polish                  | pl         |
| Portuguese              | pt         |
| Portuguese - Brazilian  | pt-BR      |
| Swedish                 | sv         |
| Thai                    | th         |
| Turkish                 | tr         |
| Vietnamese              | vi         |
| Chinese - Simplified    | zh         |
| Chinese - Traditional   | zh-Hant    |
| Chinese - Hong Kong     | zh-Hant-HK |

<Tip>
  Need more languages? Reach out to us at
  [support@flatfile.io](mailto:support@flatfile.io).
</Tip>

## Setting the language on a Space

Flatfile will auto-detect the user's language based on their browser settings.
If the language is not detectable or is currently unsupported, the system will
automatically be set to English.

### Overriding the language

You can manually set the language on a Space using the languageOverride
property. This property can be set either directly on the Space or at the
environment level if the Space has not yet been created.

All users who use the Space will only see the language set in the language
override property. Browser settings will no longer be respected.

To specify the language, simply assign the appropriate language code (e.g., 'en'
for English, 'fr' for French, etc.) to the languageOverride property.

```jsx listener.ts
listener.on("space:created", async ({ context: { spaceId } }) => {
  // This space will be in English regardless of the users browser settings
  const updateSpace = await api.spaces.update(spaceId, {
    languageOverride: "en",
  });
});
```

## Adding translations

### Creating your translation files

All our translation files can be found in our
[Platform-Translations repository](https://github.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations).
You can fork the repo or simply copy paste the files in the repository to create
your own translation files.

Simply update the values in each file with the text you would like to see.

Once you have created your own translation files, you need to make them
available to Flatfile. This is done via the translationsPath property.

<Tip>
  While creating your JSON translation files, you can opt for partial or full JSON objects:

  **Partial JSON Objects:** Just include those values you want to change. Be sure
  to maintain the same JSON structure to avoid errors.

  **Full JSON Objects:** Copy the translation file from our public repository and
  modify the values as required.
</Tip>

### Setting your Translations Path

To provide translations and text overrides you can use the translationsPath
parameter. You have the flexibility to set up translationsPaths at two levels:

* **Space:** Overrides the environment level setting.
* **Environment:** Used when no Space-level path is defined.

<Info>
  Set your translationsPath to the URL of your **english JSON file**. This should be the URL ending in `/locales/en/translation.json`.

  Don't have an english file? You can use any other language instead.
</Info>

Your `translationsPath` must meet a few requirements to work as expected:

1. It must be a string.
2. The string should be a publicly available URL that returns your JSON
   translation file.
3. It must follow this folder structure:
   ```
   yourCustomTranslationsDirectory/
       └── locales/
           ├── en/
           │   └── translation.json
           ├── es/
           │   └── translation.json
           ...
   ```
   where `yourCustomTranslationsDirectory` can be swapped out for any path
   desired.

<Tip>
  For our translations repository we would set our translationsPath to:
  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations/main/locales/en/translation.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations/main/locales/en/translation.json)
</Tip>

### Implementing Translations Path

Set up your translations path using our API or the listener. This can be done at
both the Space and environment levels.

```jsx listener.ts
listener.on("space:created", async ({ context: { spaceId } }) => {
  //set the translation path for the Space
  const updateSpace = await api.spaces.update(spaceId, {
    translationsPath:
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations/kitchen-sink/locales/en/translation.json",
  });
});
```

<Info>
  Currently we only offer translations and text overrides for the guest
  experience within your Spaces. These means there will be admin only areas that
  are not currently customizable.
</Info>

## Translating Your Custom Actions and Jobs

You can translate your own custom text used in your Actions.

Simply add the new keys to your translation.json file:

```json .../locales/en/translation.json
{
  "mySubmitAction": {
    "label": "Submit",
    "description": "Done editing the data? Hit submit to send your data",
    "tooltip": "Submit your data",
    "outcome": {
      "heading": "Successful import!",
      "message": "All data has been submitted! You can now click the link below.",
      "urlLabel": "Return to the homepage"
    }
  }
}
```

Then instead of hardcoding strings directly into your action scripts, use JSON
translation keys. Refer to these keys in your script as shown below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx sheet.js
  sheets : [
    {
      name: "Sheet Name",
      actions: [
        {
          operation: 'Submit',
          mode: 'foreground',
          label: 'mySubmitAction.label',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'mySubmitAction.description',
          primary: true,
          tooltip: 'mySubmitAction.tooltip'
        },
        {...}
      ]
    }
  ]

  ```

  ```jsx listener.js
  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      heading: 'mySubmitAction.outcome.heading',
      message: 'mySubmitAction.outcome.message',
      next: {
        type: 'url',
        url: 'https://myHomepage.com',
        label: 'mySubmitAction.outcome.label',
              },
    },
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Warning>
  If a translation key is missing from your `translation.json` file, the system
  will display the key itself as a fallback. Therefore, it's encouraged to
  always have a default language translation available to avoid showing raw keys
  to the users.
</Warning>

## Translating Your Documents

The same logic that applies to Actions also applies to your Documents. Just pass
in the custom translation keys that you added to your translation files!

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx .../locales/en/translation.json

  { "myDocument": { "title": "Your first Space!" "body": "# Welcome ### Say hello
  to your first Space in the new Flatfile!" } }

  ```

  ```jsx listener.js

    await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
      title: "myDocument.title",
      body: "myDocument.body"
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Guidelines for Creating JSON Keys

When creating JSON keys, adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Alphanumeric Keys**: Ensure keys consist of alphanumeric characters to
  prevent issues with parsing.
* **Nested Structure**: Utilize at least one level of nesting (e.g.,
  `key1.key2`) to organize translations effectively and maintain readability.
* **Avoid Whitespace and Control Characters**: Refrain from using spaces,
  newlines, or tabs in your JSON keys to avoid potential issues.
* **Don't End Keys with File Extensions**: Avoid using file extensions (e.g.,
  .csv, .txt) as the terminal segment in a key. For instance, myFileAction.csv
  is discouraged, but myFileAction.csv.uploaded is acceptable.

<Info>
  Always validate your `translation.json` file to ensure it follows the correct
  JSON format to prevent errors during runtime.

# Utilizing metadata
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/metadata

store descriptive information or data that provides additional context

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Overview

Metadata allows you to store and retrieve additional data about an Environment,
Space, Record, or Field without exposing it to end users.

## Environment-level

On the environment level `metadata` can be configured to record details about
your current enivornment state. This can be useful for developers to store
information about their deployments and even aggregate information about spaces,
users, and data therein.

### Usage

Utilize `@flatfile/api` to create or update an Environment with metadata.

```jsx
await api.environments.update(environmentId, {
  metadata: {
    version: "0.0.0",
    deployedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
});
```

## Space-level

The `metadata` object at the Space level is often used for details such as user
ID, Space name, company ID, and company name. Metadata can be added during Space
creation or at a later stage.

<Info>
  Space-level metadata, while not visible in the user interface, can be utilized
  in all listeners.
</Info>

### Usage

Utilize `@flatfile/api` to create or update a Space with metadata.

```jsx
await api.spaces.update(spaceId, {
  metadata: {
    userId,
  },
});
```

Learn more about \[adding metadata in React embedded
[Flatfile](/documentation/sdks/react/components#space).

## Workbook-level

The `metadata` object at the Workbook level is often used for details such as
expirationDate. Metadata can be added during Workbook creation or at a later
stage.

<Info>
  Workbook-level metadata, while not visible in the user interface, can be
  utilized in all listeners.
</Info>

### Usage

Utilize `@flatfile/api` to create or update a Workbook with metadata.

```jsx
await api.workbook.update(spaceId, {
  metadata: {
    expirationDate,
  },
});
```

## Record-level

Customers often require a way to store extra computed or generated information
about a record that goes beyond what the data owner provides.

The `metadata` object on the record allows you to include details like record
IDs or reference IDs to other tables.

### Usage

Using the `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook` plugin, you can access and modify
record-level metadata, similar to how it works with normal field values. In this
example, we will get the firstName from the record and store the length of the
name in metadata. This data will now be stored on the record itself.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx javascript
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
      const firstName = record.get("firstName");

      record.setMetadata({
        firstNameLength: firstName?.length ?? 0,
      });

      return record;
    }),
  );
  ```

  ```jsx typescript
  listener.use(
    recordHook("contacts", (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
      const firstName = record.get("firstName") as string;

      record.setMetadata({
        firstNameLength: firstName?.length ?? 0,
      });

      return record;
    })
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Field-level

The `metadata` object on a Field allows you to include details like how the
column of data should be transformed on egress.

### Usage

Utilize `@flatfile/api` to create or update a Workbook's fields with metadata.

```jsx
await api.workbooks.create({
  spaceId,
  name: "All Data",
  sheets: [
    {
      name: "Contacts",
      slug: "contacts",
      fields: [
        {
          key: "date_added",
          label: "Date Added",
          type: "date",
          metadata: {
            format: "MM-DD-YYYY",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

# Multi-Part Jobs
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/multi-part_jobs

split up Jobs into Parts

## What the hell is a Job Part?

A Job can be split up into multiple parts depending on the intended
functionality. This can help spread out large data sets or long tasks across
many separate listeners. When a job is split up into parts, the original part is
considered the "parent" part and it's children are considered "parts". Each Part
is considered it's own separate Job and has the full ecosystem of events
attached to it. When all Job Parts have been completed, a new event
`job:parts-completed` is emitted, so that you can listen for that event to
complete the Parent Job. This event has a payload that has summary statistics
about the parts.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "parts": {
      "total": 10,
      "completed": 10,
      "failed": 0,
      "canceled": 0
    }
  }
}
```

By inspecting this payload, you can determine if the all have completed
successfully or not. Based on that information, you are expected to complete or
fail the parent Job.

Here's an example of a listener that creates parts and waits for the
`job:parts-completed` event:

<Snippet file="guides/multi-part_jobs/job_parent.mdx" />

Here's an example of a listener that does logic on each Part:

# Scoping with Namespaces
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/namespaces

narrow down the scope of Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Overview

Namespaces allow you to narrow down the scope of Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets.
When you're monitoring for specific events, you can set your system to only
respond if the event matches the assigned namespaces.

Namespaces enable you to have:

1. **Global Listeners**: These are listeners set up to monitor activities across
   all your Spaces.

2. **Specific Listeners**: These listeners are restricted to monitor and respond
   only within a certain subset of your spaces defined by the assigned
   namespace.

### Usage

```jsx
// Create a global listener
listener.on("**", event => { ... });

// Create a filter scoped for a specific namespace
listener.namespace(['space:green'], (green) => { ... });
```

## Space-level

Space-level Namespaces are straightforward strings that are established or
modified when you create or update an [App](/learning-center/architecture/apps). This adds an
additional layer of control and specificity to your Space.

### Usage

This listener is established for the 'red' namespace within a 'space'. When a
job titled `space:configure` (clicking create new space button in UI) in the
'red' namespace (type red as namespace in the form) is ready, it triggers the
subsequent block of code.

This code will color your Space red to see that it worked.

<Snippet file="guides/namespaces/block1.mdx" />

## Workbook/Sheet-level

Workbook & Sheet-level Namespaces are straightforward strings that can be
established or modified when you create or update the Workbook. This adds an
additional layer of control and specificity to your Workbook.

### Usage

This code dynamically generates a configuration for a 'Contacts' workbook based
on the provided namespace parameter. Depending on the input namespace to the
ChildWorkbook function, additional fields may be added. If the namespace is
'orange', fields for 'Phone' and 'Meal Choice' are added. If it's 'yellow',
fields for 'Shirt Size' and 'Car Choice' are added.

# Share secrets
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/secrets

securely use credentials in listeners

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

With Secrets you can securely share credentials with listener implementations
without developers explicitly knowing the secret values upfront. Secret values
are set in the user interface, but retrieved via the SDK or
[API](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/secrets/list-secrets).

## Overview

### Creating Secrets

Secrets in Flatfile, defined as Name/Value pairs, are securely stored and
associated with an Environment or a Space. Spaces will inherit Secrets from
their respective Environment but you may choose to override any Environment
Secret for a given Space. To define Secrets shared with every Space in an
Environment, navigate to the "Developer Settings" screen for that environment.
To override an Environment value, navigate to the specific Space and select
"Secrets" in the left navigation.

<Note>
  While Flatfile encrypts all data, both during transit and at rest in our
  datastore, Secrets have an additional layer of protection. Secrets are
  encrypted/decrypted on demand using a unique set of keys. As such, a potential
  intruder would need not only access to the plaintext datastore, but also these
  extra keys to decrypt and compromise these sensitive values.
</Note>

### Consuming Secrets

While Secrets are defined in administrative interfaces for Environments and
Spaces, respectively, they are designed to be consumed by Listeners. While it
might be trivial to pass in secret values through environment variables in a
self-hosted Listener, with a Flatfile hosted Agent based Listener one must use
the Secrets features. See Usage below for some example consumer patterns.

## Usage Examples

### Sensitive Credentials

The principal utility of Secrets lies in securely storing sensitive
credentials/tokens within an Environment/Space for connecting Listeners to
third-party APIs. For instance, you might store a secret named `SLACK_TOKEN`
with a value of `xoxb-e5b7206ccac446048a8a52b703dbb4b9`, allowing you to
communicate with a Slack bot each time a custom action is triggered.

#### Example Listener

In this example, we use an `event.secrets` call to pull a sensitive Slack token
for use within a listener context. We then can use the credential to post a
message to Slack.

<Snippet file="guides/secrets/block1.mdx" />

#### Example Listener using optional props

The `options` parameter for the secrets fetch function allows optionally
choosing a different Environment or Space than the event occurred within.

<Snippet file="guides/secrets/block2.mdx" />

## Metadata

While it might seem creative to use the Secrets feature to hold non-sensitive
metadata. we encourage you to learn more about [utilizing metadata](./metadata)
within your Spaces, Records, or Fields.

## Example Project

Find the secrets example in the Flatfile GitHub repository.

# SFTP File Upload
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/guides/sftp

upload files securely and efficiently to your Space

<Snippet file="shared/projects_only.mdx" />

## SFTP Process

Flatfile's SFTP upload process allows you to transfer files directly into your Flatfile space using the industry-standard SFTP protocol. SFTP uploads are ideal for automated processes or handling very large files.

When you upload a file to Flatfile using SFTP, our system initiates a secure, automated workflow. The file is first transferred to our SFTP server using industry-standard encryption protocols, then seamlessly moved into your destination Space, and finally removed from the SFTP server once the transfer is confirmed successful.

<br />

## Obtaining Credentials

Uploading files via SFTP requires credentials. You can obtain these credentials from the Files tab in your destination Space or from the API.

<Warning>
  Each space has its own unique set of credentials that cannot be shared or used with other spaces.
  Keep these credentials secure and never share them in public forums or repositories.
</Warning>

### From Your Files Page

1. In the destination Space, navigate to the Files tab.

2. Click <b>Get SFTP Credentials</b>.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/sftp/sftp_credentials.png" alt="SFTP Credentials" width="75%" style={{ margin: '0 auto' }} />

<Info>
  If <b>Get SFTP Credentials</b> is not visible, please reach out to Support to enable Projects.
</Info>

3. Save your credentials to a secure location.

### From the API

1. Obtain your Secret Key from the [API Keys](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard/keys-and-secrets) page.
2. Obtain your Space ID from the Spaces list or the url of your Space.
3. Make an authenticated request to the sftp-credentials endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
  ```terminal request
  curl -G https://api.x.flatfile.com/v1/auth/sftp-credentials \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123" \
     -d spaceId="us_sp_123"
  ```

  ```terminal response
  {
    "data": {
      "username": <us_sp_123>,
      "password": <secret_sftp_password>,
      "host": "sftp.flatfile.com",
      "port": "22"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

4. Save your credentials to a secure location.

## SFTP Connection

## Deprecation Notice

<Info>
  Flatfile's new design system released in Q1 2025 supports a more streamlined experience when configuring theme. The new system
  accepts a more limited set of properties, but ensures those supplied properties are cohesively applied across the application.

  As a result, many of the original `theme.root` properties which applied to specific UI elements have been deprecated. We have taken
  steps to ensure some level of backwards compatibility for these properties in the new system - however we recommend any usage of these properties
  be updated to the new system as soon as possible.
</Info>

### `theme.root` \[deprecated]

#### Colors

<ParamField path="successColor" type="string" deprecated>
  The color used for successful Actions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="actionColor" type="string" deprecated>

For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new
Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate
for every interaction is preferred.

# Transform and validate
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/tutorials/projects/add-data-transformation

add validations and transformations to your listeners

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Before you begin

To make working with event data inside a listener easy, Flatfile provides a
suite of Plugins.

<Note>
  Plugins extend the functionality of a listener. They are registered with the
  `listener.use()` function and fire when the listener receives a corresponding
  event.
</Note>

The Record Hook Plugin fires whenever a row of data (a Record) is added or
modified, allowing us to take action and perform a custom transformation.

### Import the recordHook plugin

<CodeGroup>
  ```js javascript
  import { recordHook } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";
  ```

  ```js typescript
  import type { FlatfileRecord } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";
  import { recordHook } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Add your first transformation

Here's an example that modifies the first name value of a Record, converting it
to lowercase:

<Snippet file="quickstart/block1.mdx" />

As you can see, the `recordHook` has been configured to run on any Sheet
matching the slug "contacts". The second parameter to the recordHook is a
callback function where a Record, complete with it's own get and set methods, is
the incoming value.

<Info>Note: Unmodified rows do not trigger a Record Hook.</Info>

## Watch your data transform

Is your listener still running? If not, run `npx flatfile@latest develop` again.

Now, in your Workbook, add a new Record. Enter a capitalized value in the First
Name field, then click away so Flatfile knows you've finished your current edit.

Once your focus leaves the First Name field, an Event will trigger and the
`recordHook` will run the lowercase transformation you just configured.

## Add your first validation

You can also use a `recordHook` to help validate data.

For example, what if the first name in a Record is not a string? The current
code would not transform it, so let's add an error message to flag the Record.

<Snippet file="quickstart/block2.mdx" />

### Addl examples

<Tip>You can use any npm package in a plugin.</Tip>

The possible customizations are endless. Flatfile has a constantly expanding
library of
[transformation and validation plugins](https://flatfile.com/plugins/category/transform/)
that help you reshape data. You can add as many as you need to ensure your data
is clean and ready to be used.

For example, you could add code to validate a Record's email field:

<Snippet file="quickstart/block3.mdx" />

Remember that the recordHook plugin fires once per modified record, so you
should include the code for all transformations and validations you want on that
Record in the same `recordHook`.

## Watch your data validate

Check your listener is still running. If not, run `npx flatfile@latest develop`
again.

Now, in your Workbook, add or update a Record. Enter a number inside the
firstName field, or an invalid email address in the email field, then click away
so Flatfile knows you've finished your current edit.

See that error message? That's the result of your validation.

***

## Next steps

Now that you've added some transformations and validations, let's egress the
cleaned data: [Configure a submit Action](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/submit-action).


# Deploy to Flatfile
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/tutorials/projects/deploying

publish your code to Flatfile

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Listeners can be hosted anywhere. In this tutorial you've been hosting one on
your your local machine. Once ready, you can
[deploy](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/deploy) your listener directly on the Flatfile
platform.

## Deploying a listener

To deploy your listener to the Flatfile platform, simply use the CLI `deploy`
command in place of the `develop` command.

```terminal
npx flatfile@latest deploy typescript/index.ts
```

<Note>
  The Flatfile CLI deploys to the environment from yoru secret key in your
  `.env` file. To change the target environment either update that file, or
  overwrite that value by passing a different secrets key in via flags.
</Note>

You've deployed! You should see console output that looks like this:

```terminal
> npx flatfile deploy
✔ 1 environment(s) found for these credentials
✔ Code package compiled to .flatfile/build.js
✔ Code package passed validation
✔ Environment "development" selected
⠋ Deploying event listener to Flatfilencc: Version 0.36.1
ncc: Compiling file index.js into CJS
ncc: Using typescript@5.2.2 (local user-provided)
✔ Event listener deployed and running on your environment "development". us_ag_1234

```

Now that your listener is deployed to the Flatfile platform, the
transformations, validations, and actions you've configured will run server-side
in our secure cloud.

Continue to make changes in your Workbook to watch them run. Want to check the
output logs of your deployed listener (Agent)? Check out the "Event Logs" tab.

# Getting started with projects
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/tutorials/projects/getting-started

create a custom configuration step by step

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

## Before you begin

If you don't already have one, sign up for a Flatfile account
[here](https://flatfile.com/account/sign-up/).

<Note>
  To go through this tutorial you'll need a Flatfile account. We'll be using the
  credentials from your free account to assemble your first data import
  experience.
</Note>

In your account use the quickcopy button to copy your secrets key from the
[API Keys & Secrets](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard/keys-and-secrets)
page. You're about to use this credential to setup a listener in your account.

## Creating a custom app

In your Flatfile dashboard, click the **+** next to the Platform Apps header to
create a custom app. Name is `red` for the sake of this demonstration.

<Tip>
  Take note of the **namespace** that was auto-generated from the name of your
  App. It should be `red`. You'll need this soon.
</Tip>

## Building your custom app

Building a basic data import experience with Flatfile involves a four-step
process:

</CardGroup>

During this guided tutorial you'll learn about key concepts and features of
Flatfile, and get familiar with the tooling Flatfile provides to help developers
build the best possible data import experience for your users.

***

## Next steps

Let's get started by configuring a listener you'll use later:
[Setup a Listener](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-listener).


# Setup a listener
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-listener

listen and respond to events in Flatfile

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Flatfile is an event-based system. This means that an
[Event](/learning-center/concepts/events) is published on almost any interaction a
user has within the Flatfile platform.

A [Listener](/learning-center/concepts/listeners) is a function that is triggered by an
Event. It's a powerful building block because it can be completely customized,
enabling you to respond to events precisely the way your business and workflow
require.

In this step of the tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a Listener to receive
Events.

## About listeners

Let's take a look at a basic listener.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js javascript
  export default function (listener) {
    listener.on("**", (event) => {
      console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
    });
  }
  ```

  ```js typescript
  import { FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";

  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener: FlatfileListener) {
    listener.on("**", (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see, this function is listening on "\*\*", which is a wildcard that
matches all events on all Apps. All this listener does is log an incoming
Event's topic.

## Setup your first listener

Let's walk through setting up your first listener. To do this, you'll be using
some of the tools Flatfile provides for developers.

<Info>
  Flatfile is a Typescript/Javascript platform, so you will need to install
  Node.js to use all the tools Flatfile provides developers. Though not
  required, switch to Node.js v18 for the best experience.
</Info>

First, clone our
[Getting Started](https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started) repository.

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started.git
```

Then, install dependencies.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ssh npm
  npm install
  ```

  ```ssh yarn
  yarn install
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, add your credentials. To do this, create an `.env` file at the root of your cloned repository.

```ssh
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, update the `FLATFILE_API_KEY` value, setting it to your Secret Key.

## Run your first listener

Now that you have listener code configured with credentials, you're ready to
listen for Events.

We'll run this listener locally by using the "develop" command from the Flatfile
CLI.

You may chose to run either a Typescript or a Javascript version of this
listener:

<CodeGroup>
  ```terminal ts listener
  npx flatfile@latest develop typescript/index.ts
  ```

  ```terminal js listener
  npx flatfile@latest develop javascript/index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Congratulations, you have created your first listener!

You should see console output that looks like this:

```ssh console
> npx flatfile develop
✔ 1 environment(s) found for these credentials
✔ Environment "development" selected
ncc: Version 0.36.1
ncc: Compiling file index.js into CJS
  ✓ 427ms      GET    200 https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/subscription 12345

 File change detected. 🚀
  ✓ Connected to event stream for scope us_env_1234
```

***

## Next steps

To watch your listener receive an event, you'll need to trigger one. Let's learn
how to leverage your listener to
[Configure a Space](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-workbook) on the fly.


# Configure a Space
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-workbook

configure a place for collecting data by creating a Space

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Flatfile Spaces are micro-applications, each having their own database,
filestore, and auth. A Space is comprised of Workbooks, Files and Users. It can
also include Documents, Themes and Metadata.

In this example, we'll create a simple Space with a Workbook and a Document.
We'll also theme the Space to be red.

## Dynamically build your Space

When the "Create New Space" button is clicked from within your App in the
dashboard, it triggers a [job `event`](/learning-center/concepts/events) within the
**space** `domain` that initiates a **configure** `operation`.

This operation is analogous to performing a POST request to the endpoint
[/api/v1/spaces](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/spaces/create)
with the parameter `autoconfigure` set to true.

#### Usage

In the following code, we will:

1. Filter on the `red` namespace. (Or replace this with your namespace.)
2. Filter for a job by the `domain` (space) and the `operation` (configure) it
   was created.
3. Listen for a [`job:ready`](/learning-center/concepts/events#job-ready) event.
4. Acknowledge the Job and mark the progress.
5. Add the contents of the Space, including one Workbook and a simple Document.
6. Update the space theme to be the color `red`.
7. Complete (or fail) the job.

<CodeGroup>

  import api from "@flatfile/api";

  export default function flatfileEventListener(listener) {
    // Part 1: Setup a listener (https://flatfile.com/docs/apps/custom/meet-the-listener)

      // Log all events
      console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
    });

    listener.namespace(["space:red"], (red) => {
      // Part 2: Configure a Space (https://flatfile.com/docs/apps/custom)
      red.on(
        "job:ready",

              ],
            });

            const doc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
              title: "Getting Started",
              body:
                "# Welcome\n" +
                "### Say hello to your first customer Space in the new Flatfile!\n" +
                "Let's begin by first getting acquainted with what you're seeing in your Space initially.\n" +
                "---\n",
            });

            await api.spaces.update(spaceId, {
              environmentId,
              metadata: {
                theme: {
                  root: {
                    primaryColor: "red",
                  },
                  sidebar: {
                    backgroundColor: "red",
                    textColor: "white",
                    activeTextColor: "midnightblue",
                  },
                  // See reference for all possible variables
                },
              },
            });

            await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
              outcome: {
                message: "Your Space was created. Let's get started.",
                acknowledge: true,
              },
            });
          } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error:", error.stack);

            await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
              outcome: {
                message: "Creating a Space encountered an error. See Event Logs.",
                acknowledge: true,
              },
            });
          }
        }
      );
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Run your listener locally and create a new Space

To allow this listener to run, you'll want to run it locally using the same
"develop" command you used when initially setting up the listener.

As a reminder, that command is:

<CodeGroup>
  ```terminal ts listener
  npx flatfile@latest develop typescript/index.ts
  ```

  ```terminal js listener
  npx flatfile@latest develop javascript/index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once this is running, click the "Create New Space" button in your dashboard.

## Meet your Space

So what did that just do?

In your Flatfile account you should now be able to see your Space.

As you can see, this Space has a Workbook with a sheet and fields. A

<Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">
  [Workbook](https://flatfileinc.mintlify.dev/docs/orchestration/workbooks)
</Tooltip>

is like a template, its definition includes a profile of the data it expects to
hold. We call that profile a Blueprint.

<Note>
  [Blueprint](/learning-center/blueprint/about) is Flatfile's robust data definition
  language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile APIs
  leverage Blueprint for their create, update, and read operations.
</Note>

## Watch your Events

Because your listener was running, it logged your activity as the Space was
being built. You should see several events that took place.

Now, to watch your listener receive another event, make a few changes in the
Workbook. For example, try typing text into a cell.

Typing in a cell (editing a Record) triggers an Event!

```ssh console
 ▶ commit:created  10:13:05.159 AM us_evt_1234
 ↳ on(**, {})
 ↳ on(commit:created, {"sheetSlug":"contacts"})

---

## Next steps

Now that you have a Workbook in a Space, which acts both as a schema and destination for your data, you're ready to [Add data transformations](../custom/add-data-transformation.mdx).
```


# Configure a submit Action
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/tutorials/projects/submit-action

create a simple submit Action to export your data

<Snippet file="shared/dxpbanner.mdx" />

Inside your listener function, you can respond to any Event that occurs in the
environment you're listening to.

Your transformation and validation code is already responding to Record level
Events, but a listener can respond to any Event, like the
[Action](/learning-center/concepts/actions) triggered by a button click.

<Note>
  Actions are defined in your Workbook Blueprint and backed by
  [Jobs](/learning-center/concepts/jobs) in your listener.
</Note>

In this step of the tutorial, we're going to configure our Workbook's primary
Action, defined in our Blueprint as the `submitAction`.

## Adding behavior to the action

The primary Action button is located in the upper right corner of your Workbook.

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/quickstart/submit_action.png" caption="Submit in the top right corner of your Workbook" />

When this button is clicked by a user, a Job is created. We're going to listen
for that `job:ready` event, and call out to a waiting webhook to export our
data.

### Import addl packages

You'll need a few more packages to accomplish this task. Go ahead and import
them.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js listener.js
  import api from "@flatfile/api";
  import { responseRejectionHandler } from "@flatfile/util-response-rejection";
  ```

  ```js listener.ts
  import api from "@flatfile/api";
  import type { FlatfileListener, FlatfileEvent } from "@flatfile/listener";
  import { responseRejectionHandler } from "@flatfile/util-response-rejection";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Call a webhook

To configure our listener to call to a webhook, let's create a webhook. We
recommend using [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site). Simply navigate to their
site and copy `Your unique URL`.

Now, update the value of the `const webhookReceiver` variable in your `index.ts`
or `index.js` file with the webhook url you just copied.

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit_pt2.mdx" />

### Watch your Action

Check your listener is still running. If not, run `npx flatfile@latest develop`.

Now, in your Workbook click the "Submit" button in the top right corner.

Over on your Webhook.site browser tab look at the query log and observe that the
webhook received a call; this is the Action running.

***

## Next steps

Congratulations! You now now have an example listener that is performing
transformations and validations in response to changes in your Workbook, and
you've set up an action to export your cleaned data.

You've been running this listener locally while in development. Next, let's see
how easy it is to [Deploy to Flatfile](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/deploying).


# Headless
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/use-cases/headless

configure Flatfile to deliver a completely automated data import experience.

File feeds are one of the most common ways to exchange batches of data on a
regular basis. One key challenge for a traditional feed, however, is its
inflexibility. If anything changes about the way source data is extracted, or
the destination schema is configured, the feed is all but guaranteed to break.

With Flatfile's powerful headless data import capabilities, you can seamlessly
integrate a headless but *adaptable* data connection into your system.

## How it works

You can achieve a fully automated data exchange between systems in just three
steps:

[Automate ingress](#automate-ingress) \
Implement a flexible data pipeline that seamlessly uploads files to Flatfile
without manual intervention, streamlining the process of data intake.

[Flatfile processing](#flatfile-processing) \
Within the Flatfile Platform, build a comprehensive configuration that enables
automated extraction, mapping, validation, and transformation of your data.

[Automate egress](#automate-egress) \
Finally, leverage Flatfile's [Event](/learning-center/concepts/events) driven system to
automatically export the processed and transformed data from Flatfile to the
designated destination system, eliminating the need for manual exporting and
ensuring a continuous flow of data to the intended location.

## Automate ingress

Data comes from many sources, and Flatfile can handle them all. Set up automatic
feeds via cron job, cloud function, or any other method that works for your
business.

All ingress processes will leverage either our API or our SDKs.

First, configure an ingress destination. Our files will be contained in a Space.
You can think of a

<Tooltip tip="A micro-application...">
  [Space](/learning-center/architecture/spaces)
</Tooltip>

as a micro-application, each has it's own database and configurations.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block1.mdx" />

<br />

<Note>
  Our deployed agent will automatically configure a Space. For more information
  on how to configure a Space, see our [Dynamic
  Configurations](/learning-center/guides/dynamic-configurations).
</Note>

Next, we'll upload our file to Flatfile.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block2.mdx" />

## Flatfile Processing

### Extract incoming data

Incoming CSV files are automatically extracted to a

<Tooltip tip="A collection of data...">[Workbook](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks)</Tooltip>.

However, if you're sending a different file type, you'll need to configure a
listener to handle extraction.

<Note>
  See our [Extractor Plugins](https://flatfile.com/plugins/category/extractors/)
  for plug and play options or build your own.
</Note>

### Automate mapping

Once our files are extracted, we'll need to automate the mapping of our data
according to our schema. Our Automap Plugin will automatically map the data,
matching based on configureable options.

<Note>
  Because the Automap Plugin handles all the mapping, the user does not need to be redirected to Mapping after dragging a file into a Sheet.

  To prevent that redirect, set `settings: {noMappingRedirect: true}` in your
  [Workbook blueprint](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks#settings-object).
</Note>

### Validate & Transform

Similarly, validation and transformation operations can run immediately on
`records:*` events with RecordHooks. See our
[Data Handling Guide](/learning-center/guides/handling-data) for more information.

### Automate egress

Now that we've leveraged the power of the Flatfile platform to extract, map,
validate, and transform our data, we can automate the egress of our data to our
destination system.

We'll have our listener filter and run our egress logic on `commit:completed`.
This is an event specifically designed to signal the end of all processing
tasks.

<Note>
  To enable the `commit:completed` event, add a settings parameter in your
  Workbook that includes `trackChanges: true`. This has the effect of disabling
  actions on both Sheets and Workbooks until any pending commits have been
  completed. See [Blueprint](/learning-center/blueprint/sheet-options) sheet settings for more
  information.
</Note>

Here's an example where we automate emailing the processed data.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block3.mdx" />

<br />

<Note>
  Egress Jobs may need to leverage Flatfile Secrets as credentials for outgoing
  connections. See our [Secrets Guide](/learning-center/guides/secrets) for more information.
</Note>

# Portal
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/learning-center/use-cases/portal

use a portal to simplify data collection for your users

The Flatfile Portal is a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload
files directly into your application. This intuitive design ensures that users
can quickly upload their data without needing technical expertise.

## Features

### Easy Data Import

The Flatfile Portal simplifies the data import process by allowing users to drag
and drop files directly into the interface. This intuitive design ensures that
users can quickly upload their data without needing technical expertise.

### Customizable Spaces

Each instance of the Flatfile Portal operates within a "Space." A Space is a
dedicated environment where users can manage their data imports. You can
customize the Space to fit your branding and user experience needs, ensuring
that it aligns with your application's look and feel.

### Real-Time Data Validation

As users upload their files, the Flatfile Portal automatically validates the
data in real-time. This feature helps to catch errors early in the process,
ensuring that only clean, accurate data is imported into your application.

### Integration with Your Application

Once the data is validated, it can be seamlessly integrated into your
application. The Flatfile Portal provides APIs that allow you to
programmatically access the imported data, making it easy to incorporate it into
your existing workflows.

### User Management and Permissions

The Flatfile Portal includes built-in user management features, allowing you to
control who has access to the data import functionality. You can set permissions
based on user roles, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to
authorized personnel.

## Getting Started

### Embed the Portal in Your Application

After configuring your Space, you can embed the Flatfile Portal into your
application. This is typically done by including a JavaScript snippet that
initializes the Flatfile import functionality.

### Configure Your Import Settings

Once your Space is created, you can configure the import settings. This includes
defining the types of files that can be uploaded, setting validation rules, and
customizing the user interface to match your brand.

### Start Importing Data

With everything set up, users can start importing data into your application.
They can simply drag and drop their files into the Flatfile Portal, and the data
will be processed and validated in real-time.

### Egress Imported Data

Once the data is imported, you can access it through the Flatfile API. This
allows you to integrate the data into your application's workflows, ensuring
that it is readily available for use.

a collaborative data onboarding project between teams

<Tip>
  **Interested in unlocking Projects?** Talk to one of our product experts to
  learn how Flatfile Projects transforms data onboarding as you know it.
  [Connect with a product expert.](https://flatfile.com/contact-sales/consult/)
</Tip>

Each Flatfile <Tooltip tip="A micro-application...">[Space](/learning-center/architecture/spaces)</Tooltip> is an independent micro-application.
This allows you to leverage Spaces in a collaborative onboarding project between your services team and your customers.
This guide covers how to configure and use Flatfile to run consistent, high-quality data onboarding.

## How it works

Flatfile maintains and enforces your definition of quality data, and each Space acts like an escrow for data before you import that data.
With these two fundamental concepts, you can design a data onboarding experience that your customers - and your services teammates - love.

### Enforce data quality with Blueprint

Using <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">[Blueprint](/learning-center/blueprint/about)</Tooltip>, you can design a schema and rules for each onboarding project.
Blueprints are reusable across Workbooks, meaning that if you have a strict target schema, you'll only need to create the Blueprint once to use it across your entire customer base.
Additionally, you can modify a Blueprint upon the `space:created` Event if your customers have some customization ability in your application.
Finally, you may want to create a onboarding project Space with a bespoke Blueprint.
In that case, simply pass the Blueprint to the Space once it is created using the <Tooltip tip="Listening and responding to Events">[Listener SDK](/learning-center/concepts/events#building-with-events)</Tooltip>.

### Configure your Space and Blueprint for collaboration

You will want to create an <Tooltip tip="Isolated entities to create and test configurations">[Environment](/learning-center/concepts/events#building-with-events)</Tooltip> with `magic_link` authorization, which will allow members of your services team and your customers to invite others to a Flatfile Space created in that Environment.
You can also <Tooltip tip="Learn how to customize your Space">[Theme](/learning-center/guides/theming)</Tooltip> your Space to match your brand's look and feel, creating a seamless experience for your customers.
Finally, you may also wish to control how members of the Space interact with Workbooks.
This can be done via Workbook-specific <Tooltip tip="Guest permissions">[grants](/documentation/authentication/roles-and-permissions#guest-roles)</Tooltip>, as well as via setting <Tooltip tip="Restricting access to a sheet">[Sheet-level access controls](/learning-center/blueprint/access)</Tooltip>.

### Launch onboarding projects

Once you've configured the appropriate Blueprint(s) and Space, you'll simply need to create a Space with those configurations to begin running data onboarding projects.
This can happen directly from the appropriate Environment in the Flatfile dashboard by clicking "Add Space" in the top-left.
Additionally, you could choose to create Spaces directly via the Flatfile API and invite Guests to those Spaces (also via API).

# Quickstart Portal 2 Upgrade
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/upgrade/v2_upgrade

Moving on up... to the Platform

## Overview

This guide is designed to help you quickly transition from Portal 2 to the new
and improved Platform. Using our
[V2 Shim package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/v2-shims) for
assistance with the transition, you can get started on the new Platform within a
few hours. To help you compare and contrast between your Portal 2 implementation
and the Platform implementation, we created
[this Github Repository](https://github.com/FlatFilers/Upgrade-Portal) as a way
to help you see the upgrade process from beginning to the end.

## Before You Begin

With the new Platform, comes a brand new place to sign up for it. Before getting
started on your upgrade, you'll need to [sign up](https://platform.flatfile.com)
for a new account.

## Install the V2 Shims package

Before you can start using all the wonderful tools in this guide to implement
Flatfile, you'll need to install a couple of packages, the V2 Shims and Flatfile
API packages.

<Note>
  If you are using our `@flatfile/react` package, be sure to install version
  7.9.1 or higher to get the latest Platform React component.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash JavaScript
  npm install @flatfile/v2-shims @flatfile/api
  ```

  ```bash React
  npm install @flatfile/v2-shims @flatfile/api @flatfile/react@7.9.1
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Convert Your Config

The Portal 2 configuration is what contains your settings and fields in your
Portal implementation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript
  const importer = new FlatfileImporter(
      "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY",
      { } // This is your configuration object
  )
  ```

  ```jsx React
  <FlatfileButton
      licenseKey="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
      customer={{ userId: '1234' }}
      settings={} // This is your configuration object
  >
      Import Contacts
  </FlatfileButton>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You'll be able to use this configuration object with the V2 Shims package to
configure your new implementation. Keep in mind that the below snippets use a
couple of new concepts like a [Job](/learning-center/concepts/jobs) and
[Listener](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-listener). While you don't need to learn about
these to get started, they are useful for adding new functionality onto your
importer at some point in the future.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Portal 2 JavaScript
  import FlatfileImporter from '@flatfile/adapter'

  const config = {
      type: 'Contacts',
      fields: [
          {
              key: 'name',
              label: 'Name',
              description: 'Contact name',
              validators: [
                  { validate: 'required' }
              ]
          }
      ]
  }

  const importer = new FlatfileImporter('LICENSE_KEY', config)
  ```

  ```js Platform JavaScript
  import { initializeFlatfile } from "@flatfile/javascript";
  import { schemas } from "./schemas";
  import { listener } from "../listeners/listener";
  import { configToBlueprint } from "@flatfile/v2-shims";

  const config = {
      type: 'Contacts',
      fields: [
          {
              key: 'name',
              label: 'Name',
              description: 'Contact name',
              validators: [
                  { validate: 'required' }
              ]
          }
      ]
  }

  window.openFlatfile = ({publishableKey}) => {
      if (!publishableKey) {
          throw new Error(
              "You must provide a publishable key - pass through in index.html"
          );
      }

      const flatfileOptions = {
          publishableKey,
          name: 'Contact Space',
          workbook: configToBlueprint(config),
          listener,
          sidebarConfig: {
              showSidebar: false,
          },
          // Additional props...
      };

      initializeFlatfile(flatfileOptions);
  };
  ```

  ```jsx Portal 2 React
  import { FlatfileButton } from "@flatfile/react"

  const config = {
      type: 'Contacts',
      fields: [
          {
              key: 'name',
              label: 'Name',
              description: 'Contact name',
              validators: [
                  {validate: 'required'}
              ]
          }
      ]
  }

  export default function App() {
      return (
          <div className="App">

## Converting your Record Hooks

If you're transitioning from a V2 Record Hook to a Platform Record Hook in your
code, you can make the conversion by simply extracting and wrapping your
existing Record Hook code in the V2 Shim `convertHook` method.

<Note>
  If you're using V2 Record Hooks `mode` to split hooks on "init" or on
  "change", Platform does not have this mode functionality. It does, however,
  have better overall hooks performance and a new [Bulk Record
  Hook](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-record-hook#additional-options)
  method that make `mode` unnecessary.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Portal 2 JavaScript
  const importer = new FlatfileImporter('LICENSE_KEY', config)

  const recordHooksCallback = async (record) => {
      let out = {};

      if (record.firstName && !record.lastName) {
          out.lastName = {
              value: 'Rock',
              info: [
                  {
                      message: 'No last name provided so welcome to the Rock fam.',

# Portal 2 <-> Platform Concepts
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/upgrade/v2_upgrade_concepts

Key terms and concepts for your upgrade

## Overview

<Note>
  This guide is designed to teach you about and use the new Platform syntax.
  We've also created a [V2 Shim
  package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/v2-shims) to help expedite
  your upgrade. You can check out the [quickstart guide](/upgrade/v2_upgrade)
  that uses the shim to cut down your time to upgrade.
</Note>

As you transition from Portal 2.0 to Platform, you'll come across many familiar
elements that resemble what you've known. However, there might be instances
where certain components are no longer present, have been rearranged, or sport a
fresh appearance. To ensure a seamless transition, this guide is designed to
teach you those differences and how to convert. It will highlight both the
similarities and differences between the two versions, enabling you to switch
over with minimal effort. Want to see what it might look like to upgrade? Check
out our [upgrade repository here](https://github.com/FlatFilers/Upgrade-Portal)
to compare the beginning and end of upgrading.

## A comparison

Explore this illustrative diagram that lays out the distinctions between the two
products. While Platform introduces a range of additional and novel concepts
compared to Portal, rest assured, you're not obligated to embrace every new
element to transition your existing importer to Platform. Flexibility remains
key in making the switch.

### Review V2 Portal

![v2 Portal](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/guides/upgrades/V2-platform-migrations.png)

### Meet the Platform

![v2 Portal](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/flatfileinc/images/guides/upgrades/platform.png)

## Before you begin

### Core Architecture

#### Meet the Environment

In Portal, setting `devMode: true` flagged imports as “dev” imports, but in
Platform, there are true Environments.

You can have many custom Environments, but upon signup, you will have a
Development, Production, and Demo Environment configured.

All of the other entities (like Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets) will live in
those Environments.

#### Meet the Space

A Space and its UI constitute the new data importer that has replaced Portal.
The Space is what holds all the Files and Workbooks that are needed to import
data. You can learn more about Spaces and all that they do in our
[Spaces documentation](/learning-center/architecture/spaces).

#### Meet the Workbook

For Platform, it's a good idea to get to know the
[concept of a Workbook](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks). When you're upgrading,
you can think of a Workbook as the place where your import data hangs out.

Unlike Portal, where all the editing and fixing of data happens right in the
browser, Platform also has an option to perform these actions on the server
side. The data gets saved in one or more Workbooks as you go along.

Inside these Workbooks, you'll find one or more Sheets, which are similar to
schemas in Portal. Other than some basic names and settings, the sheet has
something called a "fields array," which is pretty similar to what you know from
Portal.

<Note>
  Keep in mind that if you had multiple importers to handle different data sets
  from different places, you will be able to consolidate them by having all your
  schemas now live in one Workbook.
</Note>

### Configuring your schema

#### Meet the Blueprint

Back in Portal, when you received diverse data from the same users and wished to
merge it afterward, you had to establish distinct Portal configurations and
display the appropriate one for each file. However, leveraging Blueprints offers
a more streamlined approach. You can employ a collection of Sheets (akin to the
schemas you constructed in Portal) within a Workbook. This simplifies the
process of centralizing all your data structures and collating the information
cohesively. The added advantage is that you're no longer burdened with managing
multiple uploads from various schemas.

```json Blueprint Example
{
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "products",
      "slug": "products",
      "readOnly": false,
      "allowAdditionalFields": false,
      "access": ["add", "edit"],
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "code",
          "label": "Product Code",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "description",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "price",
          "type": "number"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [],
      "metadata": {}
    },
    {
      "key": "manufacturers",
      "label": "Product Manufacturers",
      "description": "A list of maunfacturers for the products",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "manufacturer_code",
          "label": "Manufacturer Code",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "manufacturer_name",
          "label": "Manufacturer Name",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Upgrade your importer

Now we will do a side-by-side look at how we will go about upgrading your
importer. This guide will show some simple snippets that will compare the
different parts and how they are converted. You can follow along with the full
example in our [Upgrade Repo](https://github.com/FlatFilers/Upgrade-Portal).

### 1. Update your Flatfile button

The skeleton of your application should remain mostly the same. You'll see here
that we can use the same updated UI element when integrating Platform.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html Start-Portal-2/public/index.html
  <input
      type="button"
      id="launch"
      value="Import Contacts"
  />
  ```

  ```html Finish-Platform/public/index.html
  <input
      type="button"
      id="launch"
      value="Import Contacts"
      onclick="openFlatfile({publishableKey: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'})"
  />
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Initialize Flatfile

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Start-Portal-2/src/index.js
  const { contactSchema } = schemas;

  const importer = new FlatfileImporter(
      "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY",
      contactSchema
  );

  $("#launch").click(function () {
      importer
          .requestDataFromUser()
          .then(function (results) {
              importer.displaySuccess("Thanks for your data.");
              $("#raw_output").text(JSON.stringify(results.data, " ", 2));
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
              console.info(error || "window close");
          });
  });
  ```

  ```js Finish-Platform/src/index.js
  import { initializeFlatfile } from "@flatfile/javascript";
  import { workbook } from "./schemas";
  import { listener } from "../listeners/listener";

  //create a new space in modal
  window.openFlatfile = ({publishableKey}) => {
      if (!publishableKey) {
          throw new Error(
          "You must provide a publishable key - pass through in index.html"
          );
      }

      const flatfileOptions = {
          publishableKey,
          workbook,
          listener,
          sidebarConfig: {
              showSidebar: false,
          },
          // Additional props...
      };

      initializeFlatfile(flatfileOptions);
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Build a Workbook

This is where you will convert your Schema(s) into a Workbook. This is the point
where you can combine multiple importers into one by having multiple Sheets on
the Workbook. Your end users would then be able to select which data model they
are uploading into during the import process.

#### Compare and contrast

The workbook consists of three crucial components: the `name` and the `sheets`
properties.

Sheets will share many properties with those found in the Portal schema. You'll
encounter a `name` property (akin to the `type` property in a Portal schema) and
`fields` (which closely resembles your Portal `fields` array).

When it comes to the `fields` array, you'll find quite a few familiar elements
like `key`, `label`, and `description`, which all transition directly from
Portal.

#### About field types

Let's delve deeper into the Portal and Platform `type` property for fields. When
you don't specify this field, both Portal and Platform will assume a default
`string` type. In Portal, the `type: "checkbox"` is now `"type": "boolean"`, and
the `type: "select"` is now `"type": "enum"` in Platform.

Furthermore, keep in mind that while Portal only had three types, Platform has
broadened its range to include `number`, `date`, and `reference` types. To get
more details about these new field types, you can check out our
[documentation](/learning-center/blueprint/field-types). Also, we've prepared a handy reference
table below, outlining all the new types and how they were handled in Portal.

| Portal Type | Platform Type |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| String      | String        |
| String      | Date          |
| String      | Number        |
| Select      | Enum          |
| Checkbox    | Boolean       |
| N/A         | Reference     |

<Note>
  When providing select/enum options there is still an `options` array that has
  the same structure as it did in Portal. However, one thing to note is that
  this options array has been moved into a new property on the field object
  named `config` for Platform.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Start-Portal-2/src/schemas.js
  {
      label: "Deal Status",
      key: "type",
      type: "select",
      options: [
          { label: "New", value: "new" },
          { label: "Interested", value: "interested" },
          { label: "Meeting", value: "meeting" },
          { label: "Opportunity", value: "opportunity" },
          { label: "Not a fit", value: "unqualified" }
      ],
      validators: [{ validate: "required" }]
  }
  ```

  ```js Finish-Platform/src/schemas.js
  {
      key: "type",
      type: "enum",
      label: "Deal Status",
      constraints: [{ type: "required" }],
      config: {
          options: [
              { label: "New", value: "new" },
              { label: "Interested", value: "interested" },
              { label: "Meeting", value: "meeting" },
              { label: "Opportunity", value: "opportunity" },
              { label: "Not a fit", value: "unqualified" }
          ]
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Set up validations

The final aspect of converting your Portal fields into Platform fields will be
to handle the `validators` from Portal. While Portal offered many different
kinds of validators, only two have been converted in the fields themselves, and
those are `required` and `unique`. All other validations can still be handled,
but are now handled in code instead of a setting. Check out the
[other validators section](#other-validators) for examples.

The `validators` property will now be called `constraints` which is still an
array of objects. The object for each validator has traded in the `validate`
property for a `type` property, but the `unique` and `required` values remain
the same.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Start-Portal-2/src/schemas.js
  const schemas = {
      contactSchema: {
          fields: [
              {
                  label: "First Name",
                  key: "firstName",
                  description: "First or full name",
                  validators: [{ validate: "required" }]
              },
              {
                  label: "Last Name",
                  key: "lastName",
              },
              {
                  label: "Email Address",
                  key: "email",
                  description: "Please please enter your email",
                  sizeHint: 1.5,
                  validators: [
                      { validate: "unique" },
                      {
                          validate: "regex_matches",
                          regex:
                          "(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|\"(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21\\x23-\\x5b\\x5d-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])*\")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21-\\x5a\\x53-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])+)\\])",
                          error: "Must be a valid email address."

### 4. Transform Data

Coming from Portal, you are likely familiar with the concept of Data Hooks. The
same sort of functionality can be obtained in Platform, but they have moved into
Listeners and use plugins like the
[record hook plugin](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-record-hook). You can
read more about [Listeners here](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-listener) and more about
all of our [Plugins here](https://flatfile.com/plugins/).

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Start-Portal-2/src/index.js

      let out = {};

#### Other Validators

In the [set up validations](#set-up-validations) section above, we talked about
converting the `required` and `unique` validators, but validators like `regex`
or `required_with` are now handled in code in a Listener.

*Regex Validation Example:*

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Portal 2
  fields: [
      {
          label: "Company Code",
          key: "companyCode",
          validators: [{ validate: 'regex_matches', regex: '^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$' }]
      },
  ]
  ```

  ```js Platform listener.js
  listener.use(
      recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
          const companyCode = record.get('companyCode')
          const regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/;
          if (!regex.test(companyCode)) {
              record.addError('companyCode', 'Must be an alpha-numeric value')
          }
      })
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

*`required_with` Validation Example:*

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Portal 2
  fields: [
      {
          key: "city",
          label: "City",
      },
      {
          key: "state",
          label: "State",
          validators: [
              {
                  validate: "required_with",
                  fields: ["city"],
              },
          ],
      },
  ]
  ```

  ```js Platform listener.js
  listener.use(
      recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
          const city = record.get('city')
          const state = record.get('state')
          if (city && !state) {
              record.addError('state', 'State must be provided if City is present')
          }
      })
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Match your brand

Custom theming in Portal was a crucial part of making the importer like a part
of your application. Platform also has custom theming that you can use to do the
same. Check out our [theming guide](/learning-center/guides/theming) to see what all is
configurable in Platform.

### 6. Set the destination

In Portal, you were able to specify a webhook endpoint using `webhookUrl` -OR-
use the returned data within the Promise to do whatever needed to be done with
your data. With Platform, we use the Listeners to wait for the submit action to
happen and then act on it.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Start-Portal-2/src/index.js
  $("#launch").click(function () {
      importer
          .requestDataFromUser()
          .then(function (results) {
              importer.displaySuccess("Thanks for your data.");
              $("#raw_output").text(JSON.stringify(results.data, " ", 2));
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
              console.info(error || "window close");
          });
  });
  ```

  ```js Finish-Platform/listener/listener.js
  listener.filter({ job: "workbook:submitActionFg" }, (configure) => {
      configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { jobId } }) => {
          try {
              await flatfile.jobs.ack(jobId, {
                  info: "Getting started.",
                  progress: 10,
              });
              console.log("Make changes here when an action is clicked");
              await flatfile.jobs.complete(jobId, {
                  outcome: {
                      message: "This job is now complete.",
                  },
              });
          } catch (error) {
              console.error("Error:", error.stack);

              await flatfile.jobs.fail(jobId, {
                  outcome: {
                      message: "This job encountered an error.",
                  },
              });
          }
      });
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 7. Customize

While everything above gives you all sort of great information about how your
Portal implementation will convert to Platform, it's just the beginning of all
the amazing new things you can do with the Platform. Below we are going to share

# Upgrade Via @flatfile/configure
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/upgrade/v3_dxp_configure

Upgrade to Platform using DXP Configure

<Warning>
  This package simply extends functionality within our [@flatfile/configure
  package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/configure). If you're not
  already using that package, this is an unnecessary step and you should [start
  here](/upgrade/v3_upgrade) instead.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

Before you get started, there are both some new and redesigned terms to learn.
Check out our Portal 3 Upgrade Guide's
[before you begin section](/upgrade/v3_upgrade#before-you-begin) to learn about
these concepts.

## Using the plugin

If you're using the
[Portal 3 class-based syntax](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/workbooks/)
for creating your Workbooks, Sheets, etc., the `dxpConfigure` method lets you
pass in those classes and create your new Platform setup without having to move
away from the classes for now.

In the below example, there is a Workbook that is being created with the
class-based syntax like `new Workbook()`, `new Sheet()` and `TextField()`. The
new Platform has moved away from this syntax to an object-based approach. While
you won't need to convert to this syntax, it is good to
[learn about it here](/upgrade/v3_upgrade#fields-data-types-and-the-new-way-to-create-them)
for any future use cases you might have.

```js my-dxp-workbook.js
import { Sheet, TextField, Workbook } from "@flatfile/configure";

export const MyWorkbook = new Workbook({
  name: "My Workbook",
  namespace: "test",
  sheets: {
    mySheet: new Sheet("Test", {
      name: TextField("Full Name"),
      email: TextField({
        label: "Email Address",
        compute: (val) => {
          return val.toLowerCase();
        },
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

With the `dxpConfigure` method, we can now plug this into a
[Listener](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-listener) to create a new Workbook from the v3
class-based syntax.

```js listener.js
import { MyWorkbook } from "./my-dxp-workbook.js";
import { dxpConfigure } from "@flatfile/plugin-dxp-configure";

export default (listener) => {
  listener.use(dxpConfigure(MyWorkbook));
};
```

# V3 <-> Platform
Source: https://flatfile.com/docs/upgrade/v3_upgrade

Step up to the Platform

## Before you begin

### Signup for the new Platform

While both this and our version before it live in your current dashboard
together, our new Platform has its own space. Before you can get started, you'll
need to signup for a new account [here](https://flatfile.com/account/sign-up/).

### Environments

When talking about Environments in Portal 3.0, you had two to work with, dev and
prod. While the same concept of Environments exists in Platform, you will now be
able to create as many Environments as you need. By default, you will have a
Development, Production, and Demo Environment configured upon signup. You can
use these Environments and create more as needed. You can create additional
Environments
[using our APIs](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/environments/create-an-environment)
or by using the "New Environment" button on the environment switcher in the
Dashboard.

### Portal vs Space

In the current Flatfile versions (V2 and V3), we refer to Portal as an iFrame
that opens on a button click to allow your customers to import data. In Platform
(the new version), we still call the process of embedding a Portal, but we refer
to what is embedded as a Space. A Space is an open-ended component by design.
You can have a Space per customer, a Space per project, or something else that
fits your workflow. It is up to you. You can either work in a Space inside your
Flatfile dashboard or you can embed a Space into your application that opens
when your customers click on the Import button. A good way to think of a Space
is as a collection of Workbooks (explained below), while a Workbook is a
collection of Sheets. You can learn more about the structure and functionality
of Spaces [in this guide](/learning-center/architecture/spaces).

## Familiar concepts present in the new and current versions

### The new Workbook

In Platform (the new version), a Workbook is a collection of Sheets that
describe the expected shape of the data you receive. You can learn more about
the structure and functionality of Workbooks [in this guide](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks).
To create a Workbook, you can refer to our
[Getting Started guide](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-workbook).

### Same Sheet, different product

The Sheet, how it interacts with the Workbook, and what it's for are all the
same. We are calling the collections of Sheets that is the shape of your data
Blueprints. You can learn about all the options of
[Blueprints here](/learning-center/blueprint/about), but there is not a whole lot that needs
to be said for you to understand it and get rolling.

### Fields, data types and the new way to create them

If you're coming from Portal 3.0 and using the PSDK, you will be familiar with
something that looks like `new Sheet('name', { fieldName: TextField() })`. This
syntax has changed to go back to an Object-based approach that looks more
similar to the shape of the underlying API that powers it. Let's go through the
different field types and their new syntax, shown as part of a workbook in the
Platform.

#### Compare fields

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Portal 3.0
  const MySheet = new Sheet('MySheet', {
      name: TextField({
          label: 'Name',
          description: 'A name field',
          required: true
      }),
      subscriber: BooleanField({label: "Subscribed?"}),
      status: OptionField({
          label: 'Deal Status',
          options: {
              new: { label: 'New' },
              interested: { label: 'Interested' },
              meeting: { label: 'Meeting' },
              opportunity: { label: 'Opportunity' },
              unqualified: { label: 'Not a fit' },
          },
      })
  }
  ```

  ```js Platform
  const Workbook = {
      name: "Contacts",
      sheets: [
          {
              name: "MySheet",
              slug: "my_sheet",
              fields: [
                  {
                      key: "name",
                      type: "string",
                      description: "A name field",
                      label: "Name",
                      constraints: [{ type: "required" }]
                  },
                  {
                      key: "subscriber",
                      type: "boolean",
                      label: "Subscribed?"
                  },
                  {
                      key: "status",
                      type: "enum",
                      label: "Deal Status",
                      constraints: [{ type: "required" }],
                      config: {
                          options: [
                              { label: "New", value: "new" },
                              { label: "Interested", value: "interested" },
                              { label: "Meeting", value: "meeting" },
                              { label: "Opportunity", value: "opportunity" },
                              { label: "Not a fit", value: "unqualified" }
                          ]
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Things that moved

Believe it or not, the way you write DataHooks has mostly stayed the same, but
where you write your DataHooks is different. The Platform has what we call
[Listeners](/learning-center/tutorials/projects/meet-the-listener). Listeners, as you might expect,
wait for specific Events in the Platform to happen and then execute any of the
code in the Listeners subscribed to that event. In order for your Data Hook code
to run as expected, you also need to use the proper Plugin for it to work. We
have created a number of open-source plugins for the Platform, with our
[@plugin-record-hook](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-record-hook) being one
of them. Let's take a look at an example of a simple record hook now compared to
in Portal 3.0.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Portal 3.0
  const MySheet = new Sheet('MySheet', {
      name: TextField({
          label: 'Name',
          description: 'A name field',
          required: true
      })
  },
  {
      recordCompute: (record) => {
          const { name } = record.value
          if (name === 'David') {
              record.addWarning('name', 'This is the CEO!!')
          }
          return record
      }
  })
  ```

  ```js Platform
  listener.use(
      recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
          const name = record.get('name')
          if (name === 'David') {
              record.addWarning('name', 'This is the CEO!!')
          }
          return record
      })
  )
  ```

## Using GraphQL?

Were you using our GraphQL API in v3? Did you love it? No???? Same here. As
developers we might still love GraphQL, but offering it as the best and most
polished form of our API felt wrong. For Platform, our main and best kept form
of API is our REST API. You can find references to the new API
[in our documentation](https://reference.flatfile.com/).
