# UI Thing

UI Thing is a collection of beautifully designed, reusable UI components built specifically for **Nuxt**, powered by **Reka UI** and **Tailwind CSS**. It follows a shadcn-style workflow where you scaffold components into your project so you can fully own and customize the code.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Nuxt UI Components**: A large set of accessible components with clear examples and variants
- **CLI Scaffolding**: Add components (plus required utilities/config) via `npx ui-thing@latest`
- **Blocks & Templates**: Pre-built page blocks and patterns to assemble screens quickly
- **AI Assistant Support (MCP)**: An MCP server so tools like Cursor, VS Code, and Claude can fetch component source code, docs, dependencies, and install steps

## About llms.txt Implementation

UI Thing publishes both **/llms.txt** (fast navigation + essentials) and **/llms-full.txt** (full documentation context) so language models can reliably locate canonical docs, setup steps, and implementation details.

For deeper tool-driven workflows, UI Thing also provides an **MCP server** at `https://uithing.com/mcp`, exposing structured resources, tools, and guided prompts to help AI assistants work with UI Thing components, blocks, and documentation.

This makes it easy for developers using AI coding assistants to discover, understand, and implement UI Thing components directly within their coding environment.
