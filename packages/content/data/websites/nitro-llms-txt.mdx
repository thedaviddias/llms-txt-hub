# Nitro

Nitro is an open source framework to build web servers using **h3** with a strong focus on portability and a "deploy anywhere" workflow. It can be used standalone and also powers the server engine for frameworks like **Nuxt**.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Server Framework** (h3-based)
- **Filesystem Routing**
- **Deploy Presets** (multiple providers and runtimes)
- **Storage, Cache, and Database Utilities**
- **Tasks and Server Utilities**

## About llms.txt Implementation

Nitro’s **llms.txt** acts as a curated entry point to the docs and links to **llms-full.txt** for the complete documentation corpus. This helps LLM-powered tools quickly find canonical guidance for routing, storage, caching, deployment presets, and runtime support.
