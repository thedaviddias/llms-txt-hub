# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how applications can effectively communicate context and requirements to Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured way for applications to share information, constraints, and expectations with LLMs, ensuring consistent and reliable interactions.

## Key Focus Areas

- Context Standardization
- LLM Integration
- Application Communication
- Protocol Specifications

## About llms.txt Implementation

The Model Context Protocol's llms.txt documentation provides comprehensive details about the protocol specifications, integration guidelines, and best practices for implementing MCP in applications. The full documentation (llms-full.txt) includes additional examples, use cases, and advanced implementation scenarios.
