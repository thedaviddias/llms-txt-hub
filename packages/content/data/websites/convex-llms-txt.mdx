# Convex

Convex is the open source, reactive database where queries are TypeScript code running right in the
database. Just like React components react to state changes, Convex queries react to database changes.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client libraries. It makes
it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.
