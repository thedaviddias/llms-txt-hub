# UI Thing
<br/>
UI Thing is a collection of beautifully designed, reusable UI components built specifically for **Nuxt**, powered by **Reka UI** and **Tailwind CSS**. It follows a shadcn-style workflow where you scaffold components into your project so you can fully own and customize the code.
<br/>
## Key Focus Areas
<br/>
- **Nuxt UI Components**: A large set of accessible components with clear examples and variants
- **CLI Scaffolding**: Add components (plus required utilities/config) via `npx ui-thing@latest`
- **Blocks & Templates**: Pre-built page blocks and patterns to assemble screens quickly
- **AI Assistant Support (MCP)**: An MCP server so tools like Cursor, VS Code, and Claude can fetch component source code, docs, dependencies, and install steps
<br/>
## About llms.txt Implementation
<br/>
UI Thing publishes both **/llms.txt** (fast navigation + essentials) and **/llms-full.txt** (full documentation context) so language models can reliably locate canonical docs, setup steps, and implementation details.
<br/>
For deeper tool-driven workflows, UI Thing also provides an **MCP server** at `https://uithing.com/mcp`, exposing structured resources, tools, and guided prompts to help AI assistants work with UI Thing components, blocks, and documentation.
<br/>
This makes it easy for developers using AI coding assistants to discover, understand, and implement UI Thing components directly within their coding environment.
