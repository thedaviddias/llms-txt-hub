# The llms.txt Guide You Need for Your Next Project

![](/guides/article-llmstxt-banner.webp)

If you are building your next SaaS or web project,you're probably already leveraging powerful AI-assisted tools like [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), [v0](https://v0.dev/), [lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [bolt](https://bolt.new/), [replit agent](https://replit.com/) or other smart coding environments.

And if so, you've probably already learned about llms.txt files which are simple markdown files websites proposed with LLM-friendly content.

But where it can get tricky is the fact that some of those tools which rely on llms like Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini might not always have access to the latest documentation. Let's solve that problem!

## The largest directory for AI-ready documentation and tools

That's where platforms like llmstxthub.com become incredibly valuable — they maintain and constantly update the comprehensive list of websites offering llms.txt and llms-full.txt files.

Prefer working directly in your coding environment? The "LLMS.txt Explorer" extension has got you covered! This handy tool lets you:

- Search through all existing websites supporting the proposed standard
- Favourite your most-used documentation sources
- Open the text files directly in VSCode with just one click
- Stay in your flow without context-switching to browsers

Pretty handy, right?

And if you are into MCPs, you can also install the "[LLMS.txt Checker MCP](https://smithery.ai/server/@thedaviddias/mcp-llms-txt-explorer)" in Cursor, Claude or any other supporting tool.

## How to Discover Tools Supporting llms.txt?

- You can use the tools mentioned above or you could also install the "[LLMS.txt Checker" (currently only on Chrome) which will automatically check the presence of /llms.txt or /llms-full.txt files.

If your website uses a different path, submit it on llmstxthub.com and anyone visiting your domain will be shown with the correct path. The extension synchronizes with the data from the directory.

## Building Your Own llms.txt File

If you're developing an open-source project or developer tool, consider creating your own llms.txt file! It's a simple way to make your documentation more accessible to AI coding assistants and the developers using them.

The basic format is straightforward Markdown, and you can see examples from over 100 companies already implementing this proposed standard.

Stay curious, keep building amazing things, and embrace these new standards that make our developer experience smoother!
