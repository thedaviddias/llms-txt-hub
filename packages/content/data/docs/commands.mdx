# Commands

<p className="mt-2 text-xl text-muted-foreground">Complete reference for every llmstxt-cli command.</p>

## init

Auto-detect project dependencies and install matching llms.txt skills through an interactive wizard.

```bash
llmstxt init [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--category <categories>` | Filter by categories (comma-separated) |
| `--all-categories` | Include entries from all categories |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be installed without writing files |
| `--full` | Prefer `llms-full.txt` when available |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode) |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive wizard (default)
llmstxt init

# Non-interactive, install everything detected
llmstxt init --yes

# Preview without installing
llmstxt init --dry-run

# Only show AI/ML category matches
llmstxt init --category ai-ml
```

## install

Install one or more llms.txt skills by name or slug.

```bash
llmstxt install <names...> [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--full` | Prefer `llms-full.txt` when available |
| `--force` | Re-download even if already installed |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install a single skill
llmstxt install stripe

# Install multiple skills
llmstxt install react next-js tailwindcss

# Force re-download
llmstxt install stripe --force

# Prefer extended docs
llmstxt install vercel-ai-sdk --full
```

## search

Search the registry for llms.txt entries matching a query. Returns up to 10 results.

```bash
llmstxt search <query> [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--category <categories>` | Filter by categories (comma-separated) |
| `--all-categories` | Search across all categories |

By default, search is scoped to the 6 primary categories. Use `--all-categories` to broaden the search.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Search for authentication libraries
llmstxt search auth

# Search only in developer-tools category
llmstxt search testing --category developer-tools

# Search everything
llmstxt search payment --all-categories
```

## list / ls

Show all llms.txt skills currently installed in the project. Displays the name, age, and size of each entry. Entries older than 30 days are flagged as stale.

```bash
llmstxt list
# or
llmstxt ls
```

No flags. Run it in your project root to see what's installed.

## update

Update installed llms.txt skills to their latest versions. Uses etag-based caching to skip files that haven't changed on the server.

```bash
llmstxt update [name] [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | Force re-download even if the etag hasn't changed |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Update all installed skills
llmstxt update

# Update a specific skill
llmstxt update stripe

# Force re-download everything
llmstxt update --force
```

## remove / rm

Uninstall an llms.txt skill from all agent directories. Prompts for confirmation before deleting.

```bash
llmstxt remove <name>
# or
llmstxt rm <name>
```

No additional flags. The command removes the skill from `.agents/skills/` and cleans up any agent symlinks.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove a skill
llmstxt remove stripe

# Using the alias
llmstxt rm tailwindcss
```

## info

Display detailed information about a registry entry, including its category, domain, llms.txt URLs, and whether it's currently installed.

```bash
llmstxt info <name>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show info for a skill
llmstxt info react

# Works with slugs too
llmstxt info vercel-ai-sdk
```

## Telemetry

By default, the CLI collects anonymous telemetry data to help rank skills on the leaderboard. The data sent includes the command name, skill slugs, detected agent names, and the CLI version. No IP addresses, device identifiers, or personal information are collected or stored.

To opt out, set either of these environment variables:

```bash
# Console Do Not Track standard (https://consoledonottrack.com)
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1

# Or the CLI-specific flag
export LLMSTXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

When either variable is set to `1`, no network requests are made.
