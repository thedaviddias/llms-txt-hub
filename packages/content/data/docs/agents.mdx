# Supported AI Agents

<p className="mt-2 text-xl text-muted-foreground">llmstxt-cli supports 39 AI coding agents. Skills are installed once and shared across all detected agents.</p>

## How it works

When you run `llmstxt init` or `llmstxt install`, the CLI:

1. **Detects** which AI agents are installed on your machine by checking for their config directories in your home folder
2. **Installs** skill files into the canonical `.agents/skills/` directory
3. **Creates symlinks** for non-universal agents so they can find the files in their own expected directory

This means you install each skill once, and every agent on your machine can access it.

## Universal agents

These agents read directly from `.agents/skills/` -- no symlinks needed:

| Agent | Skills directory |
|-------|-----------------|
| Amp | `.agents/skills/` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.agents/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agents/skills/` |
| Kimi Code CLI | `.agents/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `.agents/skills/` |

## Project-scoped agents

These agents have their own skills directory. The CLI creates symlinks from their directory back to `.agents/skills/`:

| Agent | Skills directory |
|-------|-----------------|
| AdaL | `.adal/skills/` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/skills/` |
| Augment | `.augment/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| Cline | `.cline/skills/` |
| CodeBuddy | `.codebuddy/skills/` |
| Command Code | `.commandcode/skills/` |
| Continue | `.continue/skills/` |
| Crush | `.crush/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Droid | `.factory/skills/` |
| Goose | `.goose/skills/` |
| iFlow CLI | `.iflow/skills/` |
| Junie | `.junie/skills/` |
| Kilo Code | `.kilocode/skills/` |
| Kiro CLI | `.kiro/skills/` |
| Kode | `.kode/skills/` |
| MCPJam | `.mcpjam/skills/` |
| Mistral Vibe | `.vibe/skills/` |
| Mux | `.mux/skills/` |
| Neovate | `.neovate/skills/` |
| OpenClaw | `skills/` |
| OpenHands | `.openhands/skills/` |
| Pi | `.pi/skills/` |
| Pochi | `.pochi/skills/` |
| Qoder | `.qoder/skills/` |
| Qwen Code | `.qwen/skills/` |
| Roo Code | `.roo/skills/` |
| Trae | `.trae/skills/` |
| Trae CN | `.trae/skills/` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/skills/` |
| Zencoder | `.zencoder/skills/` |

## How detection works

The CLI checks for agent-specific directories in your home folder to determine which agents are installed. It never scans the current working directory -- this avoids false positives from project config files that happen to match agent directory names.

Detection locations vary by agent:

- Most agents: `~/.agentname/` (e.g., `~/.cursor/`, `~/.claude/`)
- XDG-based agents: `~/.config/agentname/` (e.g., Amp, Crush, Goose, OpenCode)
- Special cases: Codex checks `~/.codex/` and `/etc/codex`; Windsurf checks `~/.codeium/windsurf/`

You can see which agents the CLI detects on your machine by running `init` and observing the agent selection step.

## Adding agent support

The agent list is maintained in the CLI source code. If your favorite AI coding agent isn't supported yet, open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/thedaviddias/llms-txt-hub).
