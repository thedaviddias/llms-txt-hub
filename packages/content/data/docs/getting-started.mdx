# Getting Started

<p className="mt-2 text-xl text-muted-foreground">Install llmstxt-cli and set up AI agent skills in your project in under a minute.</p>

## What is llmstxt-cli?

`llmstxt-cli` is a command-line tool that installs llms.txt documentation files from the [llms-txt-hub registry](/websites) directly into your project. These files give AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) up-to-date knowledge about the libraries and frameworks you use.

Instead of relying on training data that may be months old, your AI agent reads the latest docs as local skill files and produces more accurate, idiomatic code.

## Installation

You can run the CLI without installing it globally:

```bash
npx llmstxt-cli init
```

Or install it globally for repeated use:

```bash
npm install -g llmstxt-cli
```

## Quick start with `init`

The `init` command is the fastest way to get started. It scans your project's `package.json` (and other config files), finds matching llms.txt entries in the registry, and installs them:

```bash
cd your-project
npx llmstxt-cli init
```

The interactive wizard will:

1. **Detect your dependencies** - scans `package.json` for known libraries
2. **Show matches** - lists registry entries that match your stack
3. **Let you pick** - select which skills to install (all are selected by default)
4. **Detect AI agents** - finds which agents are installed on your machine
5. **Install files** - downloads llms.txt content into `.agents/skills/`

### Non-interactive mode

For CI or scripting, skip the prompts with `--yes`:

```bash
npx llmstxt-cli init --yes
```

## What gets created

After running `init`, your project will have:

```
your-project/
  .agents/
    skills/
      react/
        SKILL.md          # llms.txt content for React
      next-js/
        SKILL.md          # llms.txt content for Next.js
      ...
  .claude/
    skills/
      react -> ../../.agents/skills/react    # symlink for Claude Code
      ...
  CLAUDE.md               # updated with skill references
```

- **`.agents/skills/`** is the canonical location shared by universal agents (Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Amp, Kimi Code CLI, OpenCode)
- **Agent-specific directories** (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`) get symlinks pointing back to `.agents/skills/`
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (and similar config files) are updated with references so your agent knows the skills exist

## Installing a single skill

If you already know which skill you want, use `install` directly:

```bash
npx llmstxt-cli install stripe
```

Install multiple at once:

```bash
npx llmstxt-cli install react next-js tailwindcss
```

Use `--full` to prefer the extended `llms-full.txt` version when available:

```bash
npx llmstxt-cli install vercel-ai-sdk --full
```
